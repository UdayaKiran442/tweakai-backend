A great Skills section should focus on specific abilities tailored to the job you're applying for. Think: technical capabilities, tools, software, or specialized training relevant to the position.

And how do you simplify this process to save time and maximize impact?\n\nReady to build a free resume Skills section in minutes? Try Teal now!\n\n‍\n\nFormat of a resume Skills section\nThe Skills section of your resume is a dedicated place to list soft and hard skills relevant to the role you're applying for. \n\nHard skills refer to specific technical skills or measurable abilities learned through on-the-job experience or education. Things like:\n\nPython\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) copywriting\nNotion\nLinear\nIn contrast, resume soft skills are more subjective and relate to personal attributes around how you interact with others. For example:\n\nCommunication skills\nOrganizational skills\nCross-functional collaboration\nA skills section on a resume\nUse your resume Skill section to highlight your relevant aptitudes.\n‍\n\nThe importance of a skills section on your resume\nWhile you should always incorporate both types of skills in every section of your resume, a dedicated resume Skills section will help you:\n\nClarify experience, making it easy for prospective employers to see your qualifications quickly.\nOptimize for ATS searches by including relevant keywords.\nComplement your work history with a detailed view of the skills that underpin your professional experiences and achievement-based bullet points.\nImprove readability, breaking up text with a clear, easy-to-read resume section.\nHighlight technical proficiency by showcasing your expertise in relevant software, tools, or methodologies.\nDifferentiate yourself from other job seekers who have similar experiences but may not showcase their skills as effectively.\n‍\n\nClassifying skills on a resume\nBefore you begin writing resume Skills sections, it's key to understand a few skill types you may have.\n\nWhy? Because a variety of skills can help differentiate you from the competition. \n\n‍\n\nPro Tip: Use the free Teal AI Resume Builder to store all of your skills in one place. With Teal you can categorize each skill by type (and toggle them on and off or add new skills whenever you need to!).\n‍\n\nCreate Your Skills Section For Free\n‍\n\n‍\n\nTypes of skills\nBeyond the hard and soft skills, there are other types of skills to consider for your resume. Remember, the goal is to present a balanced view of your experience.\n\nIncluding a range of skills that align with the job description helps to show your qualifications comprehensively.\n\nSoft skills\nHard skills\nTransferable skills\nIndustry-specific skills\nA graphic of types of skills for a resume\nInclude a variety of skills to show your qualifications.\n‍\n\nSoft skills\nSoft skills are also called interpersonal skills or people skills. These non-technical abilities relate to how you interact with others and approach work.\n\n‍\n\nInterpersonal skills examples\nLeadership skills: delegation, empathy, mentoring\nCommunication skills: conflict resolution, emotional intelligence, active listening\nOrganizational skills: time management, goal setting, attention to detail\n‍\n\nHard skills\nHard skills on a resume are quantifiable and teachable abilities you've gained through formal education, training, or certifications. (Things like data analysis, social media marketing, proficiency in a foreign language, or computer programming.) \n\n‍\n\nHard skills examples\nData analysis: data visualization, forecasting, statistics\nSocial media management: TikTok, Google Analytics, community management\nProduct management: market research, technical writing, UX analysis\n‍\n\nIndustry-specific skills\nIndustry-specific skills are those required for a particular field. For instance, Java, Phlebotomy, and Quickbooks fall into this category. \n\n‍\n\nExamples of industry-specific skills\nTech software development: debugging, cloud computing, API integration\\\nRetail management: merchandise planning, sales forecasting, customer relationship management\nCybersecurity: threat analysis, network security, encryption techniques\n‍\n\nTransferable skills\nTransferable skills are those that can be applied across various industries and jobs. Often, they're things you learned in one specific role that prepare you for success in another position. (Think verbal communication, customer service skills, active listening, and time management.) Many transferable skills are also considered soft skills. \n\nSome of the most common transferable skills are business skills. Business skills encompass a wide range of valuable abilities across industries—particularly in roles that involve decision-making, strategy, and interaction with clients or stakeholders.\n\n‍\n\nTransferable skills examples:\nLeadership skills: team motivation, strategic decision-making, conflict resolution\nCommunication skills: active listening, presentation, non-verbal communication\nSales and negotiation skills: market analysis, client acquisition, deal closure\nProject management skills: resource allocation, timeline management, risk assessment\n‍\n\nHow to include transferable skills on a resume\nOnce you clearly understand which transferable skills align with your experience, you can incorporate them by showcasing how you used them to create impact.\n\nFor example, let's say you're transitioning from growth marketing to product marketing; you could highlight a bullet achievement like this:\n\nDrove a 40% increase in product sign-ups by optimizing marketing funnels and leveraging data analytics, improving product engagement 3x through market understanding.\n‍\n\nUnique skills for your resume\nIn addition to the four primary types of skills, there are also unique skills. Unique skills are even more distinctive. They're more specialized or rare and aren't commonly found in the job market.\n\nIncluding unique but important skills on your resume can have a significant impact (if they're relevant to the role) because they capture the attention of hiring managers—making you a more memorable candidate.\n\nWhether it's expertise in a niche technology, a rare language, or a specific artistic talent, including these unique skills can increase your chances of landing an interview as long as they're relevant to the job.\n\n‍\n\nHow to identify what skills to put in your resume skills section\nDetermining which skills to include on your resume can be challenging because even with minimal work experience, you've gained a diverse range of skills across different areas. \n\nKnowing how to choose the best skills for your resume comes down to 3 basic steps. \n\n‍\n\nStep 1: Brainstorm your skill set \nBefore you refine your resume, you should identify all the skills you've gained over your professional journey (Or, if you're a recent graduate, during your academic experience).  \n\nReview past roles, projects, and impact\nThink about your hobbies and interests\nConsider your education\nAsk for feedback \nTake an online skills or personality assessment \nA graphic of Teal's Work Styles Assessment to evalute skills for a resume\nTake a Work Style Assessment to gauge your strengths.\n‍\n\nPro Tip: Uncover what skills you actually like to use and where your strengths are by taking Teal's Work Style Assessment, a free career personality quiz, to discover what energizes and drains you.\n\n‍\n\nStep 2: Eliminate irrelevant skills\nOnce you've brainstormed your skills, the next step is to carefully evaluate and eliminate any skills irrelevant to the job or industry you want.\n\nWhile some skills (like your ability to fly a drone or your deep knowledge of the coonhound psyche) might be impressive, if they don't directly contribute to the type of role you're seeking, it's best to leave them out. \n\nSelected skills on a resume\nIncorporate only relevant skills in your resume.\n‍\n\nStep 3: Align your skills with job descriptions\nFinally, once you have a refined list of skills, save them all in one central location with our free resume creator. Then, it's time to tailor them to each role you're applying for. \n\nWhile specific skills for each job are going to vary, it can be helpful to see a few examples of how they're listed in a job description:\n\nMarketing: execute marketing campaigns, increase brand awareness, generate leads\nSoftware: design and maintain software applications, meet user needs\nData science: develop machine-learning algorithms, support strategic initiatives\n‍\n\nTo tailor your skills the right way, you’re going to have to:\n\nExamine the job description of the position you're interested in. What are the top skills the hiring manager or recruiter is looking for? Organization skills? Airtable? Miro? Written communication skills? Critical thinking skills?\nLook for important keywords and phrases. For example, words like Python, writing skills, critical thinking, analytical skills, data analysis, problem-solving, adaptability, SEO, etc.\nCompare these keywords with the key skills you've identified, and make sure you incorporate them throughout each section to demonstrate impact (how you used them) and in your dedicated Skills section. (And you’re going to do this for every application!) \nThe Teal AI Resume Builder compares the skills from the job description to the skill set in your resume with a Match Score tool. Match Score grades your content so you're never left guessing about how your skills stack up against a job. \n\nGet Your Match Score\n‍\n\nSkills examples found in a job description compared to a resume skills section with Teal's Match Score\nCheck your skills against a job with Teal's Match Score.\nYou want your resume score to be as close to 80% as possible. (You can incorporate more skills and keywords from a job description into your content to improve your score.)\n\n‍\n\nHow to create the skills section on a resume\nNow that you understand how to identify your relevant skills, let's get into how to write a resume Skills section with some best practices and tips for layout, formatting, and how many skills to list on a resume (like, actually). \n\nChoose the right skills: Select skills that are most relevant to the job you are applying for. Review the job description carefully and match your skills to the requirements outlined by the employer.\nCategorize your skills: Group similar skills together to make the section more organized and easier for the reader to scan. For example, you can categorize skills into software, certifications, or tools.\nBe specific: Instead of listing generic skills like \"communication tools,\" list the tool name, ie. \"Loom, Zoom, Slack.\"\nUse keywords from the job description: Incorporate keywords from the job description that show your skills align with what the employer is looking for.\nLimit the number of skills: Aim to balance showcasing a wide range of skills and keeping your list concise.\n‍\n\nHow to list skills on a resume\nTo build a dedicated Skills section for a chronological resume, you should incorporate it near the bottom. (A chronological resume format presents your work experience in reverse chronological order—listing your work history, starting with your most recent position and moving backward.)\n\nYour resume sections should look something like this: \n\nContact Information\nTarget Title\nProfessional Summary \nWork Experience\nEducation\nCertifications\nSkills\nOptional\n– Projects\n– Awards and Scholarships\n– Volunteering and Leadership\n– Publications\nIf you want to create a Skills section for a functional resume (only recommended if you're transitioning careers or industries or if you've been out of the workforce for some time), incorporate your Skills section as your work experience.\n\n‍\n\nHow many skills to list on a resume\nStriking the right balance between showcasing relevant skills and avoiding a lengthy list can seem tricky; Teal Director of Talent Mike Peditto says:\n\n\"While there isn't a magic number of skills, a long list can become overwhelming and take focus away from the top skills needed for a job.\n\nFocus on the skills that appear early and often throughout the job description. Here, you'll likely find the top 5-8 skills the job is asking for, above all else.\"\n‍\n\nHow to describe skills on a resume\nEven with a dedicated Skills section on your resume, providing concrete examples of how those skills were instrumental in your success is what makes your claims credible. \n\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nWhen it comes to describing those top 5-8 skills Peditto highlights:\n\n\"These 5-8 skills are the ones you want to highlight not only in a Skills section but in other sections, too, by showing how you've used them.\n\nSpecific examples offer recruiters and hiring managers concrete proof of what you can do, which is much more effective than simply listing them in the Skills section.\"\n‍\n\nSkills in a professional summary\n\nIn your professional summary, you could highlight your communication skills in combination with your hard project management skills by saying something like:\n\n \"As a highly motivated and results-oriented marketing generalist, I have a proven track record in project management, delivering a 20% increase in team productivity through effective communication strategies and streamlined task allocation.\"\n‍\n\nSkills in work experience\n\nIn your Work Experience section, you should write resume bullet points that highlight specific hard skills. Let's say you have skills in MySQL and performance optimization and you used them in tandem with your soft skills like team leadership. A resume bullet point could look like this:\n\n\"Led a team of 3 to implement an optimized database schema using MySQL and performance optimization, reducing query response times by 40%.\"\n‍\n\nIn either situation, use strong action verbs on your resume to convey a sense of movement and impact.\n\n‍\n\nExample of a resume skills section\nIn your resume's skills section, organizing skills by type improves readability.\n\nFor example, categorize your skills into groups like \"Technical Proficiency,\" \"Communication Tools,\" or \"Tech Stack.\" Under each category, use bullets or list relevant skills.\n\nThis layout not only highlights your strengths in a structured manner but also allows recruiters to identify your key competencies in specific areas quickly.\n\nA resume Skills section\nCategorize your skills in a resume Skills section to make them clear.\n‍\n\nResume Skills section best practices\nNow that you know how to create a resume Skills section, here are some best practices for getting it right every time.\n\nRelevance is key: Ensure that the hard and soft skills you include are directly relevant to the job you are applying for. \nBe specific and honest: Only provide accurate information about your key skills and avoid exaggeration. \nUse keywords: Incorporate relevant keywords from the job description in your Skills section and other resume sections. \nAs you develop your skills section, you can use our resume example library for inspiration on how to optimize your skills for different roles.\n\nYour resume Skills section and honesty\nEven though you want to list skills that are relevant and align with a job description as closely as possible, sometimes, you might fall short. And that's okay.\n\nHere's the thing: you only want to apply for roles where you meet at least 70% of the qualifications. Why? Because you want to be capable, competent, and successful in the position you land. \n\nExaggerating or lying about skills on your resume can have severe consequences, like being disqualified from consideration. Or, if you claim to have skills you don't, you may find yourself in a position where you can't perform.\n\n‍\n\nCreate your Skills section with Teal\nStrategically writing a resume Skills section with a variety of abilities is vital to your job search.\n\nIncorporating a mix throughout your resume and in a dedicated Skills section will give a prospective employer a clear and holistic view of your qualifications. \n\nBut creating this section doesn’t have to be time-consuming. \n\nWith Teal, you can create a resume, save all of your skills and then add and remove specific ones based on the role you’re applying for. (You can also move your Skills section to any position in your resume with a drag-and-drop editor.) \n\n‍\n\nThen, leverage tools like Job Description Keywords and Match Score to see how your entire resume compares to the language of the job description!\n\n‍\n\nSign up for Teal for free today to get started.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat are the best skills to put on a resume?\nHow can I describe my skills on a resume?\nHow many skills should I list on my resume?\nWhat skills should I not put on my resume?\nDo employers want to see soft skills on a resume?"}}]}

That’s more or less the reality for the 12 percent of full-time employees and 30 percent of hybrid employees in America.\nHowever, LinkedIn cites that while remote job ads dwindle, they actually garner 50 percent of the total applications. That means there are more workers looking for remote work than remote jobs. To really stand out, you’ll need one important tool: a work-from-home resume.\n‍\n‍\nStruggling to land remote jobs with your resume? Get started with Teal’s AI Resume Builder for free.\n‍\nWhat is a work-from-home resume?\nThe work-from-home resume serves the same purpose as a traditional resume. It  showcases your skills, experience, and qualifications to potential employers. However, there are key differences.\nFor example, remote workers manage time effectively and work independently—a work-from-home resume must demonstrate those relevant soft skills.\nAs with any job, showcasing past experience in the field can help you land more work in the same field. Thus, showcasing experience working from home is helpful to land another remote job.\n‍\nWhat to include in a work-from-home resume\nWhile there's no one right way to create a work-from-home resume, there are a few essential elements the best ones include.\n‍\nObjective\nResume objectives, also called professional summaries, are statements just below your contact information and target title. \nIf you are just starting out in the remote field, the resume objective gives you the opportunity to discuss your desire to pivot into a remote work environment.\nAn objective for a work-from-home resume should include your:\nDesired position or job title\nAspirations or career goals (if pivoting into remote work)\nExperience with remote collaboration and communication\n‍\nWork-from-home resume objective sample\n\"Versatile and creative video editor with a passion for visual storytelling, eager to leverage 4 years of experience in crafting captivating video content within remote work environments.

When applying to remote positions, your physical location is less important. You have a few options:\nList your city and state\nLeave it off\nState “remote” or “location independent”\nAlways consider the job application at hand. For example, there may be an occasion where you're applying to a work-from-home position but they require you to reside nearby. In such a case, list your city and state. \n“I look for an overlap of at least three hours in our business days,” says remote work expert and freelance business owner Domenico Trimboli. “This helps solve issues in a quicker way when they arise.”\nHere's what the contact section of your remote work resume could look like:\nChris Johnson\n123-456-7890 | Chris.Johnson@gmail.com\nUS remote worker in Pacific Time Zone \n‍\nSkills and competencies\nA dedicated resume skills section helps you highlight your qualifications while optimizing your resume for ATS searches using relevant keywords.

Highlight your self-organization skills and capacity to meet deadlines.\nExample work-from-home resume soft skills\nTime Management\nSelf-Motivated\nAdaptability\nTech-Savvy\nProblem-Solving\nOrganization\nWritten Communication\nInitiative\nReliability\nCollaboration\n‍\nWork-from-home hard skills\nYour work-from-home resume must showcase your communication and collaboration skills. In addition to any technical skills needed for the role, highlight your ability to collaborate with a remote team. \nExample work-from-home resume hard skills\nVirtual Collaboration Tools (e.g., Teams, Slack)\nVideo Conferencing Software (e.g., Zoom)\nProject Management Tools (e.g., Clickup, Asana)\nRemote Desktop Applications (e.g., TeamViewer)\nCloud-Based File Sharing Systems (e.g., Google Drive, Box)\nContent Management Systems (CMS) (e.g., Wordpress)\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) Software (e.g., Salesforce, Hubspot)\nLanguage Skills \nOnline Research Skills\nCybersecurity Awareness\nPassword Sharing (1password, LastPass)\nKnowledge Management Software (Guru, Notion)\nScreening Recording Software (Loom, BombBomb)\n‍\nWork experience\nThe bulk of your resume is dedicated to listing your past experience, along with your responsibilities and achievements. You’ll want to tailor this section to the job description as much as possible, aligning your bullet points with the skills needed in the new position. \nHow do you describe remote work experience on a resume? Use the bullet points to highlight your success working in remote positions or online environments. \nHere are some examples:\nHighlight productivity: “Completed customer support tickets, exceeding monthly quota for remote team members”\nHighlight awards: “...as part of a company voted Top Remote Company to Work For 2020”\nHighlight self-motivation: “Liaised with international clients through Salesforce from a dedicated home office.”\nHighlight related experience: Include freelance and self-employed work experience\nMichelle Puccinelli, who helps companies hire and retain successful remote teams, gives this advice:\n“[I always consider:] Did the candidate 100 percent follow every single part of the instructions? If they can’t follow the written directions in an application, they’re probably not right for my virtual team. Ninety percent of [virtual] communication and project briefs in written form. And the ability to be meticulous is pretty crucial to prevent too much back and forth.”\nMatching Mode in Teal’s Resume Builder is helpful for this prep work.

That's not much room to convince someone to hire you.\nFortunately, you can use the idea a picture is worth a thousand words to create a resume with impact. Using pictures and words can give your resume a more complete snapshot of who you are—depending on your situation.\nA resume that incorporates graphics is called an infographic resume. With the right mix of color, images, and data, you can showcase your skills in a fun and memorable format.\nInfographic resumes can be super effective, but they aren't right for every person...or job. You have to use extreme caution. So let's go over what an infographic resume is, when to actually use one, and how to make one if it's best for your needs.\n‍\nStruggling with resume design? Use Teal's Resume Builder to create an eye-catching, ATS-friendly resume.\n‍\nWhat is an infographic resume?\nAn infographic resume is a type of creative resume template that combines visual design with text to present your skills, experience, and personality in a unique format. \nThere isn’t a standard infographic resume template. Some templates use star ratings, bar charts, or timelines. Whenever you see icons and images, you’re looking at an infographic resume.\nUnfortunately, an infographic resume can’t replace a regular resume. You need both for a successful job search.\n‍\nHow do infographic resumes differ from traditional resume formats?\nInfographic resume templates use visual elements while standard resumes only use text, basic formatting, and occasionally color to showcase your skills and experience. They both have the same goal: to help you get a new job. However, they differ in what settings they’re best suited for.\n‍\nWhen to use an infographic resume\nThere are a few limited instances when an infographic resume is appropriate:\nIn-person interviews as a visual aid to better explain data related to your work experience after a prospective employer has seen your skills and experience\nNetworking events or career fairs where an unusual printed resume can stand out\nPersonal website or online profiles when you have a captive audience to read your resume\nInformal jobs like dog-walker or math tutor\n‍\nCreative professionals, like graphic designers, can have both an infographic resume and a standard resume. They should use the standard version for online applications. Then, they can bring a printed copy of an infographic resume to an in-person interview to show their design skills.\nCertain industries, like banking, medicine, and federal, don't use creative resumes at all. You should always reference resume examples and best practices in your industry to apply correctly and with confidence.\n‍\nInfographic resumes and the ATS\nSimple, traditional resume templates are best for online applications because infographic resume formats are often difficult for an applicant tracking system (ATS) to parse.\nThe ATS is a way for recruiters and hiring managers to store, sort, and track resumes throughout the hiring process, and they do that by parsing the text from your resume. Data from your graphics-heavy resume won’t parse properly, meaning your resume won't be readable.\n‍\nPro Tip: If you need a resume that's visually appealing and scans correctly into ATS systems for online job applications, use Teal’s Design Mode to simplify and speed up the process.\n‍\nTeal's flexible design offers:\nAesthetics: Over 10 modern, classic, or modern templates compatible with ATS systems\nPersonalization: Adjustable fonts, colors, and line spacing\nCustomization: Fully customizable resume section order and titles\nFlexibility: Flexible layout for dates, locations, and work history\nHow to create an infographic resume\nIf you've made it this far and still decided an infographic resume is something that makes sense for you, here's a 12-step guide on how to do it.\nTo start, when creating an infographic resume, you can be bold, confident, and creative—but you should still remember this is a resume, not a graphic design project.\nUse your LinkedIn profile or existing resume as a reference for what to include. If you don’t have one, check out this comprehensive guide on resume best practices (with examples). Working from a list will help keep the focus on your qualifications, not a fancy resume template.\n‍\n1. Plan your strategy\nWhat is the most important story you want to tell? What is the best way to tell it?\nConsider your job target, preferred resume template service, and budget. Write down your goal. Stick to it.\n‍\n2. Choose the right information to include\nTo create a good infographic resume, choose the right information to showcase. Follow the basics of how to make a resume, even when you’re using an infographic format. \n‍\n3. Select an appropriate infographic resume template\nThere are countless options for resume builders and resume templates, and it’s easy to get caught up in the sheer number of resume examples online.\nEvaluate your search results to see if they are playful, polished, or professional. Pick a design and layout that makes sense for you and your job target. \n‍\n4. Research your template or builder service\nYou can either download a template or use an infographic resume builder. Before you invest your time adding your information, make sure you can customize the resume template exactly how you want. Read resume builder reviews to determine if users liked this infographic resume template or found it challenging. \nMake sure you know how much it will cost to download your resume. Many options appear free but require a small fee to download your resume.\n‍\n5. Plan your layout to showcase your best qualifications\nUse infographics sparingly. Leverage your graphic design skills to highlight your most important information. Balance visual elements like art and charts with text and white space. \n‍\n6. Add your information\nStart with your contact information and location. Most infographic resume builder tools and resume templates will have common resume sections for your skills, education, and work experience.\n‍\n7. Customize your infographic resume\nUse the right colors and fonts to complement your resume content. Don’t overload it with too many visuals—that can make a graphic resume overwhelming instead of engaging.\nYour work experience is often a good opportunity to substitute complex bullet points with simple infographics.\n‍\n8. Optimize for readability\nUse bullet points, stylized fonts, and contrasting resume colors to ensure your resume is easy to read.\n‍\n9. Proofread\nMany templates and professional infographic resume services don't have a built-in spellcheck. Edit carefully!\n‍\n10. Review and evaluate\nKeep your infographic resume achievement-focused. Your infographic elements should enhance your qualifications.\n‍\n11. Ask for feedback\nCan a recruiter pick this up and understand what makes you special? Ask for impartial feedback.\n‍\n12. Download and share\nSave your infographic resume as a PDF to preserve the design.\nRemember, you shouldn’t use an infographic resume to apply for a job online. Instead, you might want to use an ATS-friendly template, like the ones Teal offers.\n‍\nFive infographic resume examples\n1. Childcare infographic resume example\nThis resume from Venngage works really well for a babysitter. The challenge with using this resume template is that your information might not fit as neatly into the provided space.\nPros: Eye-catching design, clear key points, and a good amount of space for job experience.\nCons: The social media icons at the top appear to be designed for links when this resume would actually be best suited for printing out to give to potential employers.\n‍\n2. Creative infographic resume format\nAnother example from Venngage, this UX designer infographic resume template incorporates a color gradient and corresponding color for the headshot background. The language fluency charts are a nice representation of the applicant's skills. This resume template isn't the right choice for an online application, but it might be appropriate to send it to a contact in the tech industry for an informational interview.\nPros: Balanced use of graphic elements and text, and the color is bold without being overpowering.\nCons: Too much resume real estate is devoted to certifications and skills ratings, while not enough space is left for the professional work history.\n‍\n3. Online networking infographic resume sample\n\nThis interior designer resume from Visme is the type of resume you could email to a potential client. It uses too much color to print but successfully integrates graphic design elements, like shapes and contrasting colors, with information.\nPros: The colored box for the awards draws a reader's eye. The contact details are clear and easy to find.\nCons: The resume layout doesn't allow for enough relevant information or explain this person's career progression. The section header font choice and color is hard to read at a glance; one font would be better.\n‍\n4. Interview example of infographic resume\nThis infographic resume from Piktochart is an example of something you could bring to an interview. The hiring manager will already have seen your full resume--that's how you landed the interview! This version gives you something to reference during your interview and leave behind as a reminder of who you are and what you do.\nPros: Plenty of room for you to explain your work history. The design is simple yet refreshing, with round icons and one accent color. The bar graphs compare foreign language fluency concisely.\nCons: A US resume format doesn’t normally include a headshot, but you can include one on an infographic resume for networking or interviews.\n‍\n5. Online infographic resume templatesThis resume template by Canva is bold and distinctive yet keeps the design simple. This is a useful visual resume template for when you don't want to say too much. The timeline is a creative way to explain some career milestones, for example, if you earned a degree during your career.\nPros: The black background makes the rainbow color scheme feel subtle and sleek.\nCons: It's missing a work history and an education section, so this isn't one of the best infographic resume templates for job seekers. There's only room for four skills. This template is fun but unlikely to catch recruiters' attention.\n‍\nTips for an effective infographic resume\nYour infographic resume needs to be simple and readable. Ensure your resume is easy to read with a big enough font, clear headings, and logical organization.\n‍\nUse design effectively and efficiently\nAs author Robin Williams notes in The Non-Designers Design Book, “Design should communicate its message effectively and efficiently.” When applied to resume writing, this means your overall design should still convey that you want a job and are qualified to have that job. \n‍\nLimit icons and graphics\nLimit your use of logos, icons, and graphics to ensure they’re helping people understand your resume, not distracting them. \nNormally, you shouldn't put a headshot on a US resume format due to ATS compatibility issues and discrimination concerns. However, you should put an image on a resume in certain countries or, in limited situations, some jobs.\n‍\nTest for ATS compatibility\nUse a simple copy-paste test to check your resume’s electronic readability. If you can copy text onto a blank document and read the information, you pass the copy-paste test!\nWhen your resume doesn't pass this test, that's still ok for certain direct communication settings.\n‍\nKeep the design consistent\nDouble-check that your font and stylistic design elements are the same from top to bottom. Inconsistent formatting comes across as unprofessional.\nPeople often want to see how their resume looks on various templates. Teal’s resume builder is super helpful for this. Once you upload your resume, you can try out the smart template options to preview your resume formatting.\nWith Teal’s AI Resume Builder, you can rest assured your resume’s design and formatting are consistently perfect—without manual work.\n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid in an infographic resume\nAvoid the most common mistakes in infographic resumes. These errors will catch the hiring manager's attention, but not in a good way.\nHard-to-read fonts\nVisual clutter\nInconsistent layout\nSpelling errors\nPoor color contrast\nImbalanced white space\nDistracting visuals\nUnprofessional design\nOvercomplicated layout\nYou can manually fix these mistakes or use a tool that fixes them for you. One option is Teal's AI-powered Resume Builder. It's designed to prevent all of these common errors.\n‍\nAre infographic resume templates right for you?\nCreative resumes might help you land the right job if you use them wisely. They can make your experience stand out or serve as an engaging supplement to your existing resume. However, you shouldn’t use them for online job applications or most job industries. Use an infographic resume strategically for in-person events, online profiles, and direct communication\nTo ensure your resume is both visually appealing and appropriate for online applications, check out Teal’s Resume Builder.

It feels like you need a confetti cannon or marching band to stand out to recruiters.\nA statement of qualifications is a powerful way to command the attention of hiring managers by pulling your most impressive achievements, relevant skills, and key takeaways into an easy-to-read bulleted list.\nThis guide covers how to write a statement of qualifications, including templates and examples.\nNeed help writing powerful statement of qualifications? Try Teal’s AI Resume Builder to create one fast with AI.\n‍\nWhat is a statement of qualifications?\nA statement of qualifications (SoQ) is a list of three to six bullet points that capture your most pertinent or transferable skills, work history, and achievements to a specific position or job description.\nThink of it like your highlight reel. It calls attention to your skills and tangible results that relate directly to the job in question. You might also see it called a “summary of qualifications” or “qualifications summary.”\n‍\nWho needs a statement of qualifications?\nIf this concept is new to you, don’t be alarmed. A statement of qualifications doesn’t carry the same weight in the hiring process as a resume or cover letter. That said, there are times you may need to prepare this statement.\nWhen you need a statement of qualifications\nThe job posting specifically asks for one: Statements of qualification are more common in government and public sector jobs, but you might also see requests in industries like engineering, construction, IT, healthcare, science, and research.\nYou have an opportunity to submit additional materials: If you have the chance to submit supplemental materials with your job application and resume, this statement can highlight your best qualifications, demonstrate extra effort, and help you stand out from the competition.\nEven if you don’t plan to submit your statement to apply for a position, creating one can be a helpful exercise. As you write, you’re forced to focus on your most notable qualifications, achievements, and experiences, which can be valuable groundwork when it comes to resume writing, crafting your cover letter, or preparing for upcoming job interviews.\n‍\nHow is a statement of qualifications different from a resume or cover letter?\nYour statement of qualifications is an entirely separate document from your resume or cover letter. If asked to submit one, do not combine it with other files.\nHowever, your statement of qualifications will overlap with your other career documents, as it summarizes the high points. Because the content itself is similar, so will your approach to writing it, including:\nUnderstanding the job qualifications so you can emphasize relevance\nFocusing on your most impressive accomplishments\nUsing action verbs to highlight your contributions\nIncluding quantifiable results to demonstrate your impact\nAnd again, even if you don’t actually need to submit a written statement to an employer, writing one can help you better identify what skills and qualifications you want to highlight in your other documents and conversations. For example, the information you uncover when writing your statement could also be adapted and used in your resume summary, your cover letter, or even in a dedicated resume section. \n‍\n‍\nHow is a statement of qualifications used in the hiring process?\nIf an employer or hiring manager asks for a statement of qualifications, they’re using it as part of the initial screening process—likely even before they look at your resume or the rest of your application. The hiring manager will review the submitted statements to create a shortlist of candidates that should move forward.\nThink about it this way: Scanning a list of three to six points is a lot faster and easier than reviewing a resume. So, if and when a company requests a statement of qualifications from applicants, they’re likely using it as a tool to narrow down the initial pool of candidates in an efficient way.\n‍\nHow to write a statement of qualifications\nWhether the job ad specifically asked for this document or you want to use it to do your due diligence or stand out to the hiring manager, these steps and tips will help you write a great statement that summarizes your most important details and qualifications.\n‍\n1. Analyze the job description\nMuch like with your resume, relevance is the name of the game. Your impressive skills don’t matter if they aren’t relevant to the role. Conversely, they could make you seem overqualified for a job.\nIn order to understand exactly what makes you qualified for a position, you need to start by identifying the expectations set in the job description.\nComb through the job posting and pay close attention to the job title, responsibilities, skills, education, and other qualifications the employer lists. Highlight or note the ones you possess.\nFor each bullet point in the job ad ask yourself, “Do I have this?” or “Have I done this?” If your answer is yes, highlight it and then create a separate sheet where you can jot down specific examples of how you satisfy those requests or demands. That brainstorming document will be valuable as you move into the next steps.\nOr, make this even easier with Teal’s Matching Mode. Select a bookmarked job and Teal will compare your resume and surface important keywords from the job description that you should add or emphasize.\nTailor Your Resume to a Job Description\n‍\n‍\n2. Identify your highlights\nIf you’ve been in the workforce a while and aren’t making a major career change, you likely match a lot of the job qualifications. Now it’s time to pull out the best ones. Revisit the job posting to understand the most notable skills and experiences that qualify you for the position or let Teal’s Matching Mode automatically surface them for you.\n‍\nTo find skills and qualifications that are important, look for ones that are:\nListed under “required qualifications” or a similar header\nFrequently emphasized\nListed under “preferred but not required” or a similar header\nAdd Keywords to Your Resume\n‍\n‍\nTIP: If you’re struggling to narrow down your list, ask yourself this: If you could only tell the hiring manager five things about your skills, experience, and work history, what would they be?\n‍\n3. Quantify and specify your achievements\nA solid statement isn’t just a list of what you did—it also explains why that mattered. When you have your list of the achievements and skills you want to include, add extra impact by quantifying your results or incorporating specific examples.\nStatement of qualifications example\nBasic: Led and managed a sales team to consistently surpass sales quotas.\nBetter: Led a team of 10 sales representatives to consistently surpass sales quotas, resulting in a 15% year-over-year increase in team performance.\nSee the difference? Metric-driven business achievements go beyond lip service or buzzwords and provide recruiters the real-world proof of ways that your skills and knowledge have contributed to company success.\nIf you’re struggling to add metrics to your own bullet points, Teal’s AI Resume Achievements feature can help. \nWithin a resume, click “Add achievement” and “Write with AI” to get three auto-generated achievements to consider and customize. While they’re created within the Resume Builder, you can also use them on your statement of qualifications as well.\nCreate a Resume with AI\n‍\nTeal's AI Resume Achievement feature helps you write impressive, quantifiable achievements.\n‍\n4. Put together your points\nWhen you know what skills you want to highlight and what results you achieved with those skills, it’s time to put together your bullet points. These need to be short yet impactful. This statement of qualifications format can help you write points that are clear, concise, and compelling.\nHow to structure your statement of qualifications bullet points\nAction verb + task + metric = outcome\nStatement of qualifications example\nResolved outstanding customer service inquiries and complaints efficiently, achieving an average response time of under two minutes that led to a 95% customer satisfaction rate\n‍\n5. Consider your order\nYour statement of qualifications is short. So, in an ideal world, employers are making it through your entire list before deciding whether to move you forward in the process.\nEven so, it’s smart to think about the order. All of them are important (otherwise they wouldn’t appear on your statement at all), but putting your most essential qualifications at the top ensures they capture the hiring manager’s attention right away.\nIf aspects like education level or experience seem crucial, it’s worth dedicating your first bullet to your current job title, education, or years of experience to set the scene for the rest of your list.\n‍\n6. Refine your document\nWhile your statement itself is short and simple, add some extra polish by putting your bullet points on a document that matches your resume and cover letter (with the same header on top).\nNot only does that make your statement look more finished and professional, but it also ensures prospective employers know who that list belongs to if it gets separated from your application or other career documents.\n‍\n7. Proofread and polish\nWhen you have your list almost finished, dedicate enough time to proofread and confirm that your document is error free. It’s also worth briefly revisiting the job posting to review your statement with relevance top of mind. When it comes to your search for a new job, details can make the difference. \n‍\nStart with a statement of qualifications template\nA powerful statement is one that you both personalize to your experience and tailor to a specific job. However, this simple summary of qualifications template can help get the wheels turning.\nStatement of qualifications template\n[Adjective] [job title] with [number] years of experience in [key responsibility] and [key responsibility]\n[Action verb] [accomplishment or skill] that led to [specific result or impact] within [timeframe]\n[Action verb] [task or project] by [method or strategy], achieving [metric] in [goal]\n[Action verb] [skill or experience] to [compete task or achieve goal] leading to [metric] for [company, team, or project]\n[Action verb] [accomplishment or task], which resulted in [metric] in [timeframe]\nFill in the blanks to generate your own list. Struggling to find the right words? Teal’s AI Resume Achievements will automatically generate quantified achievements you can tailor and use.\nCreate Resume Achievements with AI\n‍\n‍\nStatement of qualifications examples\nA template is a reliable starting point, but seeing what that template can turn into is even more helpful. Using the template above, here are three statement of qualification examples in a variety of industries.\n‍\nStatement of qualifications example #1\nExperienced content marketing manager with eight years of experience in creating high-quality content and developing successful content strategies.\nDevised a comprehensive content plan that led to a 40% increase in organic website traffic within 6 months.\nOptimized social media campaigns by conducting A/B testing and data analysis, achieving a 25% boost in audience engagement in two months.\nLeveraged SEO skills to improve search engine rankings, leading to a 30% increase in inbound leads for the marketing team.\nCreated engaging blog posts and video content, which resulted in a 50% rise in reader engagement in four months.\n‍\nStatement of qualifications example #2\nSkilled senior software engineer with 10 years of experience in full-stack development and system architecture design.\nDesigned and implemented key software features that led to a 30% improvement in application performance within three months.\nLed the development of a major software project by using Agile methodologies, achieving on-time delivery completion that was under budget by 10%.\nUtilized advanced problem-solving skills to optimize existing code, leading to a 20% reduction in system bugs for the development team.\nMentored junior engineers in coding best practices and software development principles, which resulted in a 50% increase in team productivity in six months.\n‍\nStatement of qualifications example #3\nDedicated customer support specialist with 5 years of experience in resolving customer inquiries and providing exceptional service.\nHandled complex customer issues that led to a 90% resolution rate within 24 hours.\nStreamlined the support process by implementing a new ticketing system, achieving a 20% reduction in response time in three months.\nLeveraged strong communication skills to assist customers effectively, leading to a 95% customer satisfaction rate for the support team.\nTrained new support team members in company policies and customer service techniques, which resulted in a 30% increase in team efficiency in six months.\n‍\nSummarize your skills to stand out in your job search\nA statement of qualifications sounds formal and intimidating. But in reality, it’s a short list that captures your most relevant skills and experiences, so they’re not overlooked by hiring managers.\nEven if you aren’t asked to submit a statement of qualifications with your job application, here’s a free piece of advice: Creating one is still a helpful exercise.\nNot only does the process help you better understand what a role or organization needs and how you match, but it also lays the groundwork for a far more compelling resume, cover, letter, and interview conversation.\nThink about it this way: When you take the time to understand your own career highlight reel, you’re better equipped to incorporate those points in every aspect of the hiring process.\nWriting impactful achievements can be hard, but Teal’s AI Resume Achievements and Matching Mode features can take the pain out of the process by automatically finding the right keywords to include and generating metric-driven achievements.\nSign up for Teal for free today.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIs a statement of qualifications the same as a cover letter?\nWhat statement best describes the summary of qualifications portion of a resume?\nHow much detail should be in a statement of qualifications?","URL Slug":"statement-of-qualifications"}}]}

It's how you say, \"I've got the experience and the skills you're looking for,\" but on paper.\nHowever, creating a great resume can be a lot to take on without the right information.\nBelow, you'll learn what a resume is, the key details it should include, and how it differs from other application materials. You’ll also find tips, examples, and tools to help you create a resume that stands out—every time you hit apply.\n‍\nReady to build a resume that gets noticed in just a few steps? Start with Teal’s AI Resume Builder for free.\n‍\nWhat is a resume?\nA resume or résumé is a professional summary document used for job applications. It showcases your professional background, skills, and accomplishments. It's an important tool when applying for a job (or even an internship) because it's usually required and provides potential employers with the information they need to decide whether or not you are a good fit for a specific position.\nThink of it this way: You are a business, and your specific skills and experience are your products. Your resume is a sales document showcasing those products as your unique qualifications for a specific job.\nCrafting a standout resume and knowing when to use it versus other application materials like cover letters or CVs is crucial. Understanding these nuances can directly impact your chances of landing an interview.\n‍\nPurpose of a resume\nA resume gives hiring managers a quick snapshot of your qualifications, helping them decide if you're a good fit for the position. It highlights your professional journey and emphasizes your relevant skills and achievements.\n‍\nIs a resume the same as a CV?\nWhen it comes to comparing a resume versus CV, these two documents are different.\nWhile both are used in job applications, a CV (Curriculum Vitae) is typically longer and more detailed—it's often used in academic, scientific, and international job applications.\n‍\nComparison of a CV vs. resume\nLength: CVs are usually longer, often several pages, while resumes are typically between one and three pages.\nContent: CVs provide a comprehensive overview of your entire career, including education, publications, and research, whereas resumes focus on relevant skills and experiences tailored to a specific job.\nUse cases: CVs are more common in academia and international job markets, while resumes are standard in most industries in the United States.\n\n‍\nIs a resume the same as a cover letter?\nNo, a resume isn't the same as a cover letter.\nA cover letter is a separate formal document that accompanies your resume. It provides additional context and a personalized introduction to your application.\n‍\nComparison of a cover letter vs. resume\nPurpose: A cover letter explains why you're interested in a position and how your skills and experiences make you a good fit. A resume provides a detailed summary of your qualifications.\nFormat: Cover letters are typically formatted like letters, while resumes use bullet points and specific sections to organize information.\nContent: Cover letters offer a narrative, focusing on your motivation and suitability, whereas resumes list specific achievements and skills.\n‍\nIs a resume the same as a LinkedIn profile?\nNo, a resume isn't the same as a LinkedIn profile. A LinkedIn profile is an online or digital representation of your professional identity, while a resume is a document specifically tailored for a job application.\n‍\nComparison of a LinkedIn profile vs. resume\nFormat: LinkedIn profiles are digital and can be continuously updated, while resumes are static documents tailored for specific job applications.\nContent: LinkedIn profiles often include more comprehensive information, such as endorsements, recommendations, and a broader range of experiences.\nUse cases: LinkedIn profiles are used for networking and job searching, while resumes are submitted directly to potential employers.\n‍\nIs a resume the same as a portfolio?\nNo, a resume and a portfolio aren't the same. A work portfolio is a collection of work samples (physical or digital) that demonstrate your skills and accomplishments, particularly in creative fields.\n‍\nComparison of a portfolio vs. resume\nPurpose: A portfolio showcases your actual work, providing tangible examples of your abilities. A resume summarizes your qualifications and experiences.\nFormat: Portfolios can be physical or digital collections of work samples, while resumes are written documents.\nContent: Portfolios include detailed work samples, projects, and case studies, while resumes list your professional history and skills.\n\nWhat to include in a resume\nA resume typically has a combination of some (or all) of the following sections. But while the parts of a resume may vary from person to person, the core sections tend to remain the same.\nContact Information\nTarget Title\nProfessional Summary\nWork Experience\nEducation\nCertifications\nSkills\nOptional\nProjects\nAwards and Scholarships\nVolunteering and Leadership\nPublications\nInterests\n‍\nWhat is needed in a resume?\nContact Information\nPotential employers have to be able to reach you. Include contact details like your full name, phone number, email address, city and state, LinkedIn profile URL, and personal website if applicable.\n‍\nTarget Title\nA target title sits just beneath the contact information on your resume. It reflects the position you're applying for and sets the tone for the rest of your resume.\nThis title may change depending on the job you're applying to, aligning with the specific role's title. Aligning these elements makes it easier for a hiring manager to find you when they search for candidates with that title in an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).\n‍\nProfessional Summary\nThis is a brief statement that gives employers a quick overview of your years of experience and what you bring to the table. Your summary should reflect your unique professional journey and skills and should be tailored to the particular job you're applying for.\nTeal's Director of Talent, Mike Peditto, has some valuable advice for job seekers about professional summaries.\n\"If I can copy and paste your summary and put it almost word-for-word on somebody else's resume, and it makes no difference, it’s not a great summary for you.\n\nIf you're going to use the top of your resume for a summary, be sure that it stands out and really shows off what makes you a great fit compared to every other applicant. Provide some wins, experience, or insight about you that uniquely qualify you for the role!\"\n‍\nWork Experience\nThis section of your resume showcases your previous jobs and the impact you made. It's important because it shows your practical, hands-on experience and skills in a professional setting.\nUse bullet points to highlight this part of your employment history. They should include key accomplishments alongside hard and soft skills and their results, focusing on quantifiable bullets (like metrics, numbers, and data).\nFor example, \n‍\nEducation\nYour Education section lists your academic background, including degrees earned, institutions attended, and graduation dates. It shows employers your formal training and typically aligns with key qualifications or requirements.\nStart with your highest level of education or highest degree and work backward. Unless you're still in college or just starting out without any formal education, you likely don't need to list your high school education.\n‍\nCertifications\nAny relevant certifications that add value to your professional profile and align with the position you're applying to. They demonstrate specialized knowledge and skills that are pertinent to the job.\n‍\nSkills\nA list of relevant skills (such as tools and technical abilities) should be tailored to the job you’re applying for. This helps employers quickly see your areas of expertise.\n‍\nTips for making each part of the resume stand out\nUse a clean, professional format with consistent fonts, white space, and resume bullet points to break up large blocks of text\nHighlight key bullets in your work experience with specific metrics (e.g., \"Increased sales by 20%\")\nTailor your resume content to align closely with the job description using keywords and other important language\n‍\nWhat is optional in a resume?\nNot all resumes need every resume section available. Below are some optional parts and some reasons why you may want to consider including them.\nProjects: Include any significant projects relevant to the job you're applying for. For example, mention projects where you've applied skills to achieve specific results. For example, developing a new software feature, leading a successful marketing campaign, or completing a complex research project.\n‍Awards and Scholarships: This section can set you apart from other candidates. Highlight specific accolades showing your excellence and dedication to your field, like academic achievements, professional awards, or industry-specific honors.\nVolunteering and Leadership: Mention if you have relevant volunteer work or leadership experience to show your commitment and ability to lead and work in teams. The key here, though, is relevance. Your time walking dogs at Wild Coonhound Rescue may not be relevant to your application for an entry-level data analyst position.\nPublications: List any articles, papers, or books you have published if they are relevant to the job to demonstrate your expertise and thought leadership in your field.\nInterests: Include interests if they are relevant to the job or if they can provide a more complete picture of who you are in a way that relates to the job you're applying for. For example, interests demonstrating teamwork, leadership, or relevant tools and tech.\n‍\nWhat not to include in a resume\nWhile there are plenty of elements you should always include in your resume, there are also some things you want to avoid.\nIrrelevant work experience that doesn’t align with the job you’re applying for\nPersonal information like age, marital status, or your social security number\nUnprofessional email addresses\nHobbies or interests that do not add value to your application\n‍\nResume types\nChoosing the right resume type depends on your career history and the job you're applying for.\nThere are three standard resume formats, each with its own strengths and best use cases. They are:\nChronological\nFunctional\nCombination\nUnderstanding these formats will help you decide which one best showcases your skills and experiences.\n‍\nChronological resume\nA chronological resume (also called reverse chronological resume) lists your work experience in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent job.\nThis format is the most recognizable and is ideal for those with a solid work history in a specific field. A chronological resume clearly shows your career progression. It highlights your job titles, employers, and dates of employment, making it easy for hiring managers to see your career trajectory.\n\n‍\nFunctional resume\nA functional format (or skills-based resume) is a resume written to focus on your skills and qualifications rather than your chronological work history.\nThis format is less popular than the chronological resume and is only best for those with little to no work experience or larger career gaps. You should use a functional resume if you want to emphasize transferable skills and focus less on job titles or dates of employment.\n\n‍‍\nCombination Resume\nA combination resume (sometimes referred to as a hybrid resume) merges elements of both chronological and functional resumes by highlighting qualifications and skills equally.\nA combination resume starts with a professional summary, followed by a dedicated skills section, and then transitions into a detailed (but relevant) chronological work history.\nThis format benefits job seekers who have a solid work history but also want to emphasize their skills and accomplishments.\n\n‍\nHow to use Teal's Resume Builder\nWhile there's no such thing as a perfect resume, creating a good resume that aligns with the job description of the role you're applying to can be simplified with the right tools.\nWhat is a resume builder? A resume builder is an online platform that simplifies creating and updating resumes. It offers one place to input your professional details, customize formats with drag-and-drop editing, and fine-tune content with analysis and scoring tools.\nTeal’s Resume Builder removes the guesswork and stress of creating a resume, helping you not create a professional document that stands out.

Fill out the details in every section. Teal’s guidance will help remove the guesswork of \"what goes where\" so you can build a comprehensive database of your skills and experience.\n‍\n3.

Show prospective employers you have the skills and relevant experiences they’re looking for.\nFirst, click the checkbox next to the relevant experiences and skills in your base resume. Then, click the “Matching” tab in the Resume Builder. Select a job from your saved roles (or upload a new one) to see how your experience and desired job align.\nTeal’s Job Description Match tool analyzes the language in your resume and the job description to give you a Match Score. This number represents how closely your existing resume aligns with the job description. Aim for a Match Score of at least 60 percent. Increase your score by adding keywords from the job description identified by Teal’s Job Description Keywords tool.\n‍\n7. Choose a resume template and customize design\nTeal offers plenty of ATS-friendly resume templates, and you can customize the design and format of your resume.\nHead to the Design tab, choose a template and use the Drag-and-Drop Editor to move around or rename your resume sections.\n‍\nYou can also choose different font styles, colors, spacing, and more so your resume reflects not only your skills and experience but also your unique personality.\n‍\n8.

Get started with Teal’s Resume Builder for free.\n‍\nWhy use a resume builder?\nCreating a good resume involves many steps. And without the right resume tool, it can easily become a time-consuming, demanding job.\nSome challenges job seekers might face?\nNot knowing what to do first \nNot understanding exactly what employers are looking for\nWriting resume bullet points that communicate and quantify achievements \nOptimizing for applicant tracking systems (ATS)\nTailoring experience for each specific job application\nKeeping content updated\nManaging information across platforms without mistakes\n‍\n4 reasons to use a resume builder\nA resume builder directly addresses job application challenges like not knowing where to start, what employers want, or how to tailor for every position, with features like optimization tools, dynamic editing for easy updates, content suggestions, and integrations. \nHere are four reasons to consider using a resume builder:\n‍\nReason #1: Store and manage multiple resume versions\nKeeping your career history and multiple versions of your resume in one place simplifies tailoring your application for each unique job and regularly updating your experience and skills.\n‍\nReason #2: Generate content with AI\nAI assists in writing resume bullet points and professional summaries, preventing you from staring at a blank page and enabling you to articulate bullet points that showcase your impact and results.\n‍\nReason #3: Optimize content for best practices and unique job descriptions\nKnowing how your resume stacks up against modern best practices and each unique job description will help align your content with employer expectations and industry best practices.\n‍\nReason #4: Integrate with other job search tools\nFacilitating seamless data transfer across platforms (like job boards or a job application tracker) reduces errors and saves time on manual work, making your job search as efficient and error-free as possible.\n‍\nResume builder vs. alternatives\nManual methods for writing your resume (like Word Docs, Google Docs, or tools like Canva) can be helpful in a pinch, but they also have drawbacks.\nWord and Google Docs make formatting difficult. With complex layouts and multiple details that change each time you apply for a new job, reformatting your resume (without disrupting multiple parts!) is time-consuming.\nTools like Canva resume templates might be easier to format. But while they offer visually appealing designs, because of their heavy graphics, these resume templates aren't easily parsed by the ATS.\nBuild Your Resume Now\n‍\nWhat makes a good resume builder?\nCreating a resume that lands you an interview involves more than just listing experience—it requires strategic formatting, precise tailoring to job descriptions, and continuous updates.\nThe best resume builder for your needs does more than just fill in a resume template; it offers smart tools that address these specific needs.\nHere’s what you should look for in a resume builder:\n‍\nFeature #1: Write and store unlimited, tailored resumes.\nWithout the ability to store your entire career history, you have to start your resume from scratch each time you apply for a job. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors as you rush to tailor your best resume template for each new application.\nA good resume builder allows you to save your entire career history in one place as a base resume. But, since not every detail of your history is relevant to each role you apply for, it also enables you to create and store multiple versions, each tailored with only the most relevant details from that base resume.\n\n‍\nFeature #2: Optimize your resume with dynamic scoring tools and AI.\nCreating a resume that meets the standards of the job market and the specific demands of each job can be tough. Without guidance, you might struggle to highlight relevant details in a way that showcases impact and aligns with employer expectations.\nA good resume builder helps you identify gaps in your content. And whether those gaps are missing details in specific sections or important keywords, it should also help you bridge them. With tools like generative AI to write summaries and resume bullet points, keyword suggestions, and recommendations to improve your content, a good builder doesn't just tell you what you're missing—it helps you fill in the blanks.\n‍\n‍\nFeature #3: Stay organized with a connected resume.\nManaging multiple job applications manually can become chaotic and error-prone. If not meticulously organized, keeping track of them (and the specific resumes you used for each) can easily lead to mistakes and missed opportunities.\nThe best resume apps integrate with job application tracking directly in the same platform where you create, store, and update your resumes. This integration should allow you to easily track which resume version was used for each job, when to follow up, and more. A great resume builder will also show how well your skills and experience align with a job posting right in the job tracker—so you don't waste any time applying for positions that aren't the right fit.\n‍\nAre resume builders free or paid?\nResume builders offer free and paid plans, each with different tools and features.\nHere's a breakdown of common features you might find in a free online resume builder versus paid builders:\n‍\nFree resume builder common features\nCreate and download a resume\nResume templates\nResume examples to use as a guide\nBasic customization options\nBasic editing tools\nBasic analysis tools\nAI feature trial\nBasic keyword identification\nBuilt-in guidance\n‍\nPaid resume builder common features\nAdvanced analysis tools\nUnlimited AI generation\nUnlimited job description keywords\nAdditional templates\nFull customization capabilities\nCover letter builder\n‍\nTeal is rated and reviewed as one of the best free resume builders.\nTeal's resume builder free features can support your entire job search, while Teal+ offers more advanced tools.\nWith Teal+, you get unlimited AI generation for professional summaries, resume bullet points, and cover letters.

Get started\nFirst things first, create your account and get settled in. This is where you lay the groundwork.\nIf you already have a clear picture of what job title you're targeting or specific goals in mind, great! Set these up in your account to customize your experience from the get-go.\n‍\n2. Import your information or start from scratch\nGot an old resume or a LinkedIn profile? Upload it! Then, make sure everything scans into the right sections and make edits as needed.\nIf you're starting from scratch, no worries—treat the Resume Builder like your career history's new home. Fill out the details in each section. Teal's Guidance will tell you what details to include. Think of this as building a comprehensive database of your skills and experience.\n‍\n‍\n3. Use AI to beat the blank page\nStuck on what to say? Don't just stare at a blank page. Use AI to generate your professional summary and resume bullet points. \nAI should give you a great foundation. (With Teal+, you get unlimited AI, so you can revisit this when you customize your resume for different job applications later.)\n‍\n‍\n4. Analyze your content\nOnce your details are in, analyze your resume.\nTeal's Resume Checker will help you align your content with modern best practices by identifying what's missing or what could be polished (for example, overlooking metrics or a lengthy professional summary). \nHow does it work? Resume Analysis gives you a score, shows you exactly where the gaps are, and offers suggestions for fixing them so you can increase your score. Try to aim for 60 percent or higher.\n\n‍\n5. Integrate your job search\nDon't jump back and forth across multiple platforms and folders to save and apply for jobs.\nInstead, install the free Teal Chrome Extension to easily save job listings from 40+ job boards with just one click. This saves time and powers up other features in the Resume Builder, like Match Scoring and AI Cover Letter Generation.\n‍\n6. Match your resume to job listings\nYou may have heard it's important to tailor your resume to each unique job you apply for. This is true. You have to show prospective employers you have the skills and experience they're looking for.\nFirst, because only some things you've done are pertinent to a job, click the checkbox next to the experiences and skills in your base resume that are relevant to the role.\nThen, click the \"Matching\" tab in the Resume Builder. Here, you can select a job from your saved roles (or upload a new one) to see how your experience and desired job align.\nTeal's Job Description Match tool analyzes the language in your resume and the language of a job description to give you a Match Score. This number represents how closely your existing resume aligns with the job description you compared it to.\n‍\n‍\nYou want your Match Score to be at least 60 percent. You can increase your score by adding keywords from the job description identified by Teal's Job Description Keywords tool. \n‍\nPro Tip: If you want to see how your experiences stack up to a job at a glance, you can attach a resume to a job in the Teal Job Tracker with \"Attachments\" and see your Resume Analysis and Match Scores.\n‍\n7. Choose a resume template and customize\nWhile Teal comes with plenty of ATS-friendly resume templates to choose from, you also have the freedom to customize the design and format of your resume. \nHead to the Design tab. Here, you can choose a template and use a Drag-and-Drop Editor to move around (or rename!) your resume sections. You can also opt for different font styles, colors, spacing, and more, so your resume doesn't just reflect your skills and experience; it also reflects some of your unique personality.\n\n‍\n8.

Get started with Teal’s free Resume Builder.\n‍\nWhat is a CV?\nThe term \"Curriculum Vitae\" comes from Latin, meaning \"course of life.\" This definition reflects the CV’s role in presenting a comprehensive overview of your professional experience.\nA CV provides a detailed account of your academic background, professional milestones, and research contributions. It emphasizes your growth, achievements, and expertise and is particularly popular in fields like academia, research, and specialized industries.\n‍\n\nPurpose and function of a CV\nA CV serves as an extensive professional profile and biography, particularly in academia and research settings. Its primary function is to give a slightly more comprehensive view of professional accomplishments\nA CV provides a thorough account of your professional life, allowing potential employers or academic institutions to assess your qualifications and contributions to your field.\n‍\nWhen to use a CV instead of a resume\nBoth a resume and a CV should answer the same primary question about the value you bring to the workplace. And some job seekers even use these terms interchangeably. However, the choice between a resume and a CV often depends on your industry or geographic location.\nWhile resumes are widely used across various industries, CVs are preferred or required in specific contexts:\nWhen requested by a prospective employer\nAcademic positions (e.g., professorships, research fellowships)\nMedical or scientific positions\nResearch roles in laboratories or institutions\nGrant applications\nFellowship or scholarship applications\nInternational job applications outside the US, where a CV is more commonly used\n‍\nCV vs. resume\nUnderstanding the key differences between a CV vs. a resume can help you choose the right format for your job search.\nWhile a US resume spans 1-3 pages, a CV may be slightly longer (depending on your experience and accomplishments) and typically includes two columns.  The length also hinges on where you're applying. An international CV may require a more comprehensive overview of your career experience that includes job responsibilities.\nA CV also emphasizes your academic and research achievements, as well as relevant certifications, more than a traditional resume. That is to say, these sections aren't necessarily optional. A resume is a bit more focused on recent work experience, key skills, and achievements that are directly related to the job you're applying for. In either case, both documents should be tailored to the job you're applying for.\n‍\nCV vs. cover letter\nA CV and a cover letter serve different purposes in the job application process. A CV provides a detailed overview of your academic and professional history, including your skills, experiences, and accomplishments.\nIn contrast, a cover letter is a concise, personalized document that introduces you to the employer, explains why you’re a strong fit for the position, and highlights the most relevant aspects of your CV tailored to the job description. While the CV offers a comprehensive look at your qualifications, the cover letter is your opportunity to make a strong, tailored first impression.\n‍\nParts of a CV\nUnderstanding the key sections of a CV helps in crafting a comprehensive document that effectively showcases your qualifications. Here’s the ones you need:\n‍\nContact Information\nYour CV should begin with your contact information, including:\nFull name\nLocation (including address only if you're creating a CV in international job markets)\nPhone number\nEmail address\nProfessional social media profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, ResearchGate)\nEnsure this information is current and professional. Use an email address that incorporates your name rather than a casual or humorous one.\n‍\nPersonal Statement\nKnown as a personal profile or personal statement outside the US, this CV summary offers a brief overview of your qualifications and career aspirations. It should be 3-5 sentences and tailored to the position you’re applying for—focusing on your most relevant skills, experiences, and achievements. In academic CVs, this may align more closely with a research statement or teaching philosophy.\n‍\nCareer Experience\nYour CV should detail your roles and achievements in reverse chronological order. It should also include quantifiable achievements where possible to demonstrate impact, particularly in research or technical roles.\nYour title\nName of company\nDates of employment\n3-5 CV bullet points that highlight your achievements (with impact) that are relevant to the position you're applying for\n‍\nEducation\nThe education section is crucial in a CV, especially for academic positions. List your academic history in reverse chronological order, starting with your highest degree, and include:\nUniversity: List the full name of the institution. For international applications, fully spell out the location and institution’s name to avoid confusion.\nYear graduated: This helps potential employers or academic institutions understand the timeline of your educational background and verify any details through background checks\nDegree earned: Specify the degree (e.g., Ph.D., Master’s, Bachelor’s)\nDissertation or Thesis Title: Include if applicable to your role or industry\n‍\nIf you're a recent graduate or your industry requires, consider adding:\nHonors: Outside of the US, these are often referred to as qualifications (e.g., First-Class Honors, Dean's List 2016-2018).\nCoursework: Particularly if the courses are highly relevant to the job you’re applying for and you're creating a CV with limited career experience\nProjects: Especially relevant for most job seekers in research-focused fields\n‍\nSkills\nYour CV Skills section should focus on the technical skills necessary for you to excel in your job. Usually referred to as hard skills, these abilities are specific and measurable.\nConsider skills like:\nLab techniques\nProgramming languages\nStatistical analysis software\nForeign languages\nPro Tip: If you're looking for an all-inclusive solution to creating a CV, Teal's flexible CV design has everything you need—without having to manually format every section or detail.\nChoose from plenty of 2-column templates, incorporate additional sections, rename and reorder your experience to fit your industry and market, and more.\n\nOptional parts of a CV\nMuch like a resume, which can be tailored with additional sections based on your industry and experience, a CV also offers flexibility with optional parts. These additional sections help you highlight specific skills, achievements, or experiences that are relevant to the role or field you’re pursuing, allowing you to present a more comprehensive picture of your qualifications.\n‍\nResearch\nCVs are popular for research positions, which require more in-depth sharing of past experience and expertise than resumes. In this CV section, highlight how your research has contributed to your field and any notable impacts or innovations resulting from your published work.\nFor research-focused positions, this section is vital. Include research experience such as:\nResearch projects you’ve worked on\nYour role in each project\nMethodologies used\nKey findings or outcomes\nFunding sources (if applicable)\n‍\nTeaching Experience\nIf you're applying for a teaching-focused academic position, such as a professor role, your teaching experience is the core of your career experience. However, a dedicated Teaching Experience section can also be valuable if you have instructional positions that complement your primary professional focus or if you're applying for positions where teaching is not the central responsibility but still plays a significant role.\nFor example, if you've taught courses or conducted training sessions in addition to your primary job duties in positions that combine research, industry expertise, and teaching or if you're an academic who has taken on significant teaching responsibilities beyond the norm for your role—such as designing new courses and leading educational initiatives\nIn this section, include the following:\nCourses\nInstitutions\nDates\nAchievements\n‍\nPublications and Presentations\nPublications and presentations are key components of a CV, especially in academic and research-focused fields, as they highlight your scholarly contributions and expertise. These can include various types of work, such as:\nPeer-reviewed journal articles\nBook chapters\nConference presentations like invited talks or poster sessions\nTechnical reports\n‍\nAwards\nThe Awards section can be an important contribution to your CV that highlights the recognition you’ve received for your academic and professional achievements. This section not only showcases your excellence but also provides evidence of your contributions and impact in your field. Just remember any award should be relevant to the job you're applying for.\nConsider including the following:\nAcademic awards\nResearch grants\nFellowships\nScholarships\nProfessional honors\n‍\nProfessional Associations\nThis CV section highlights your active involvement in your professional community. Being a member of relevant academic or industry organizations demonstrates your commitment to staying connected with current professional development in your field, as well as your engagement with professional networks. Focus on:\nOrganization names\nYour membership status\nLeadership titles held\nSignificant contributions to the organization\n\n‍\nCV examples and templates\nWhether you're applying for an academic, research, or professional role, examining CV examples tailored to your field can provide invaluable insights into the formatting, content, and presentation expected by employers.\n‍\nAcademic CV example\nAn academic CV focuses on your educational background and academic achievements. It includes detailed information about your degrees, institutions attended, and relevant coursework. Additionally, it highlights your teaching experience, academic honors, professional skills, and a thorough list of publications and presentations.\n\n‍\nResearch CV example\nA research CV is designed to detail your contributions to scientific or academic research. It includes an in-depth look at your research projects, methodologies, and significant findings.\nThis CV should also feature your published papers, conference presentations, and any research grants or funding received, providing a comprehensive view of your academic impact and expertise.\n\n‍\nProfessional CV example\nA professional CV is tailored to showcase your career achievements and professional experience. It emphasizes your recent job roles, key responsibilities, and accomplishments in the workplace.\nThis CV is designed to highlight your industry-specific skills, leadership roles, and career progression, aiming to present you as a strong candidate for high-level positions in your field.\n\n‍\nPro Tip: Need more guidance?

It’s an employer’s way of saying, “You’ve got potential we’d like to explore.”\nDepending on the organization, being shortlisted means you’re one of a few people who might leave the final interview with the job. It’s a serious achievement—but there’s still work to do. \nIn this article, you’ll learn what being shortlisted means in different contexts, how many candidates make it to the final round, and signs you’ve been shortlisted. \nReady to create a targeted resume that increase your chances of being shortlisted? Build a resume with Teal for free.\n‍\nWhat does shortlisted mean?\nBeing shortlisted for a job means you match the initial criteria for the position. For large organizations (1000+ employees), shortlisting is just the first of many steps. For smaller companies or startups, one round of shortlisting and an interview might be the entire process. \n‍\nFactors that influence shortlisting\nMost companies consider these six factors when working to shortlist candidates:\nExperience: Your past roles and responsibilities align closely with the job requirements\nSkills: Specific skills listed in your resume match the job description\nQualifications: Relevant educational background or certifications\nAchievements: Noteworthy accomplishments that speak to the skills you’ve highlighted\nKeywords: Use of industry-specific terms that match the job listing\nProfessionalism: A well-structured, error-free resume\n‍\nHow your resume influences shortlisting\n‍\nA well-crafted resume can be the difference between instant shortlisting for certain jobs and trudging through application after application—unsuccessfully.\nEmployers often receive hundreds of applications in today's digital job market. A standout resume quickly conveys why you’re the right fit by highlighting your most relevant skills and experiences. Instead of listing past roles, tailor your resume to each unique application.\nYou can customize your resume by:\nUsing keywords from the job description.\nHighlighting relevant achievements and experiences.\nFormatting your resume for clarity and readability.\nBy aligning your skills and experiences with the job requirements, you increase the likelihood of catching the recruiter’s eye and making it to the shortlist.\n‍\nPro Tip: Teal’s Resume Builder can help you align your content to different job descriptions. Using Teal's Match Score, you can see how your existing skills and experiences stack up to a job and what you should optimize to boost your resume's impact on your shortlisting status.\nCheck Your Match Score\n‍\n‍\nWhat does it mean to be shortlisted for a job?\nBeing shortlisted for a job means you're not just another applicant—you're a strong candidate who has met the essential criteria and piqued the hiring manager’s interest. It’s a positive signal that your resume stood out and aligned closely with the job requirements.\nThere are two main cases when you might be shortlisted: for a position or for an interview. Let’s take a closer look at each situation:\n‍\nWhat does it mean to be shortlisted for a position?\nBeing shortlisted for a position usually means one of two things:\nThe hiring manager liked your resume, but they haven’t started interviewing. They’ll get back to you with next steps as they decide to close the first stage. \nYou’ve finished an interview (or a set of interviews) among a small group of finalists—one of whom the company will award the job. \nIn either case, it means you’ve emerged victorious from your current stage. For a small group of candidates, shortlisting is kind of like being nominated for awards; it signifies recognition of potential and qualifications in a competitive field.\n‍\nPro tip: Ask your hiring manager or recruiter about the timeline of events. This will give you clarity on how long you have to prepare questions and potential answers for the interview.\n‍\nWhat does it mean to be shortlisted for a job interview?\nBeing shortlisted for an interview can mean one of two things:\nIf the company is small, being shortlisted might mean you’ve made it to the final round—the interview.\nIf the company is mid- to large-size, an interview shortlisting usually means you’ve made it past the cursory scan of candidates but you might still face several interviews before a final decision. \n‍\nPro tip: Tailor your preparation for each interview stage. Start by reviewing the company's core values, and then align how you talk about your experiences and skills to what's important to them.\n‍\nThe implications of being shortlisted (what comes next)\nBeing shortlisted for a job is an encouraging milestone, but it also signals the need for continued effort and preparation. At this stage, three things are a given:\nEveryone else who’s made it to the shortlist is also a viable (and potentially great) candidate\nYou’ll need to prepare well for a final interview \nYou’ll need to prepare for a round of job offer negotiations \n‍\nResearch by Teal highlights it can take up to 21 intentional applications to receive one job offer, highlighting the importance of persistence even when you make it to a company's shortlist of candidates.\n\n‍\nHow being shortlisted affects your chances of getting the job\nThe average corporate job opening gets 250 resumes. Of those, between four to six will be called for an interview, and the interview process takes an average of 23 days. So, if you’ve made it to the interview round, your chances of getting the job are considerably higher than when you applied.\nBut this also means every other candidate in the interview is also a competitor. So you’ll need to prepare well for the following stages. Research by Teal highlights that it can take up to six first-round interviews to land an offer.\n‍\nHow many candidates make it to the final interview?\nLanding a final interview is a feat in itself. But how many candidates actually make it that far? Let's break it down.\nThe numbers don’t lie: after submitting up to 10 applications, 47% of job seekers will get shortlisted for 1–2 interviews.\nBut not all companies are built the same. Here are three factors that can determine how many candidates a company will shortlist and hire: \nCompany size: Smaller companies might narrow down to a single final candidate sooner, while larger firms might have multiple interview rounds.\nPosition level: Senior roles often see fewer final candidates because they require specific expertise. \nIndustry standards: Different industries have varying norms for the number of final interviewees. For example, tech startups might prefer a more streamlined process compared to legacy government agencies. \n‍\nHow to increase your chances of making it to the final interview\nTo boost your odds of being shortlisted, do these three things: \nUse tools like Teal’s Resume Job Description Match to match your skills and experience with the requirements of a job description \nDemonstrate how you’ve solved challenges and had an impact in previous roles\nResearch the company’s culture and recent achievements, and then tailor your pitch to show how your skills and values align perfectly with their current needs\n‍\nJane Shand, HR Director of Streamline HR, has this to say about increasing your chances of making it to the final interview: \n“If you have personalized your cover letter, explained why you find our organization and specifically this job exciting, told us what you could offer us in this role, and you fit at least 80% of the requirements of the role, chances are you are being considered.”\n‍\nPro tip: Follow individuals from the company on LinkedIn and interact with their posts. This shows genuine interest and can set you apart before the interview stage.\n‍\nSigns you’ve been shortlisted for a job\nA job offer is almost always preceded by subtle indicators. Here are some telltale signs you’ve made it to the shortlist: \nPersonalized communication: You receive detailed emails with notes from your interview or resume (rather than generic responses)\nRequests for additional information: Employers or hiring managers ask for more documents like references, portfolios, or work samples\nInterview scheduling: You’re asked to schedule multiple rounds of interviews—especially with senior team members\nDiscussing availability: The hiring manager starts discussing your availability or potential start date\nFollow-up questions: You receive post-interview follow-up questions asking you to provide more details about your last role or complete a mock assignment \n‍\nPro tip: Always follow up with a thank-you email after each interview. It reinforces your interest and keeps you top of mind.\nBut thank-you emails during a job search can create cognitive strain. That’s why Teal has communication templates you can personalize and send out to hiring managers.\n‍\nHow to use Teal's Match Score to leapfrog the shortlist\nNow that you understand more about shortlisting, follow these steps inside Teal’s platform to boost your chances of making the list: \n‍\nStep 1: Import your resume\nImport your existing resume into the AI Resume Builder. You can also import your LinkedIn profile or create a resume from scratch in minutes if you don't have one. The greater the level of detail you provide, the better your resume will be. \n‍\nStep 2: Add a job\nClick the \"Matching\" tab at the top of your dashboard. Then, select a specific job description to attach to your resume in the drop-down menu. (You can either choose from your Job Tracker directly or create a new job for comparison.)\nStep 3: Review your Match Score results\nYour Match Score indicates how closely your resume matches the job description. A good Match Score is 60% or higher. You can increase your score by adding more of the identified keywords—getting you one step closer to the shortlist because you show how what you've done relates to the specific position you're applying for.\n‍\nBoost your chances of being shortlisted with Teal\nLanding on a short list is a milestone. Even if you don’t get the job, it still validates your skills and achievements—and puts you a step closer to your dream career.\nA free resume maker like Teal's can't guarantee you'll land on the shortlist, but it can help you create a better resume that increases your chances.\nBy leveraging advanced tools like Match Scoring, you can align your resume closely with job descriptions—highlighting the most relevant experiences and skills.

And how can you emphasize all you have to offer in a way that makes every word count and focuses on what truly matters to your next potential employer?\n\n‍\n\nDefinition of relevant experience on a resume\n“What type of experience should I put on my resume?” is a common question for job seekers. \n\nThe truth is that you might have a lot of different background experiences that could benefit you in your job search. But does all of it apply to the specific job you’re applying for? Usually, no.\n\nRelevant experience on a resume includes any information that showcases your specific skills, knowledge, and achievements while aligning with what the hiring manager or recruiter believes is necessary for the role. \n\nAnd while past job experience falls under this category, other types of experience, such as academic work or volunteering, can also show that you’re a good fit for the position.\n\nThe one thing that’s important to keep in mind is that what counts as “relevant” experience ultimately depends on the specific job. This means you may have to tailor your resume (including the “Work Experience section” section) for every job application.\n\n‍\n\nWhat counts as relevant resume experience?\nWhile it will vary from one application to another, there are a few categories of relevant experience you should consider including in your resume and cover letter:\n\n‍\n\nPrevious job experience\nYour resume work experience is the most important section.\n\nTo deserve a mention, a past job needs to be recent and relevant. That means the achievements you list beneath that experience include skills, qualifications, and impact that align with the job you’re applying for, and it’s part of the past 10 years or so of your work history.\n\nFor example, while you may have customer service skills from a past experience fifteen years ago, your relevant qualifications and experience as a copywriter might be a better fit if you're applying for a role as a certified professional resume writer.\n\nRelevant experience on a resume\nMake sure your past job experience is recent and relevant.\n‍\n\nVolunteering efforts\nIf you’re involved in any volunteer work or community service projects, these are things worth listing on your resume. Volunteer experience may not demonstrate transferable skills in the same way that relevant work experience does. However, any good career coach will tell you that hiring managers and potential employers highly value volunteer work.\n\nVolunteer experience shows you have a good work ethic and a strong moral compass—qualities employers prioritize. Depending on the nature of your volunteer work, it may also showcase soft skills such as leadership or communication.\n\n‍\n\nFreelance work\nThere was a time when freelance work wasn’t viewed all that highly by prospective employers. Today, though, it’s often some of the most relevant experiences you can list.\n\nFreelance work related to the job position counts as relevant experience, the same way holding a full-time job in the industry would. Freelance experience can also demonstrate important soft skills and competencies to a potential employer, including:\n\nGood time management\nProblem-solving\nThe ability to self-motivate\n‍\n\nAcademic work\nIt’s obvious that you’ll want to include any degrees or certifications you’ve earned on your resume. However, there are other types of academic experience, aside from just your coursework, that may be worth listing as well, such as:\n\nResearch experience\nThesis or capstone projects\nLeadership roles in academic organizations\nTeaching/tutoring experience\n‍\n\nInternships and Co-ops\nInternships and  co-ops (cooperative education) experiences are invaluable additions to any resume—particularly for recent graduates or those transitioning into a new field. These experiences are rich sources of relevant skills and knowledge, allowing you to:\n\nGain hands-on experience in a real-world setting.\nDevelop and apply industry-specific skills.\nNetwork with professionals in your field.\nUnderstand workplace dynamics and expectations.\nWhen listing internships or co-ops, focus on the impact you had and the skills you developed that are relevant experience to the job you're applying for. Highlight any projects or achievements that demonstrate your capability (and adaptability) in a professional environment.\n\n‍\n\nTraining and Certifications\nBeyond formal education, additional training and certifications can greatly improve the relevant experience on a resume.\n\nThis section is particularly crucial if you're applying for roles that require specific technical skills or certifications. Include:\n\nProfessional development courses\nTechnical certifications relevant to your industry\nWorkshops or seminars attended\nThese additions underscore your commitment to continuous learning and staying updated with industry trends and technologies.\n\n‍\n\nAdd relevant experience on a resume with Teal\nThe Teal AI Resume Builder offers comprehensive resume sections to help you focus on relevant experience, incorporate freelance projects, highlight relevant skills and certifications, and more in one central location—for free.\n\nWrite Your Resume\n‍\n\nAdding relevant experience on a resume with Teal\nAdd all of your relevant experience on a resume in one location.\n‍\n\nBest practices for listing relevant experience on a resume\nAlong with knowing what counts as relevant experience, there are several other factors that you need to consider before listing work experience on your resume.\n\nIf you want to know how to make your resume stand out to potential employers, here are the best practices you should follow:\n\n‍\n\n1. Align your relevant experience with the job description\nOne of the first and most important steps when applying for a new job is to carefully consider the job description. \n\nHere, you'll find the specific skills, qualifications, and experience the employer seeks in a candidate. You can use this information to determine which experience to showcase on your resume.\n\nFor example, if the job description mentions the need for good project management skills, experience overseeing successful projects will make your resume appealing. Or, if it lists coding skills as a requirement, competing in coding competitions could be a great thing to show off.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that aligning your relevant experience section with the job description doesn’t just mean listing industry-related experience. It can also be helpful to align your relevant experience with the mission and values of the company you are applying to. \n\nFor example, if they focus on sustainability, volunteer work in conservation would be a great thing to mention.\n\nRemember that the job description is an employer’s chance to tell you what they’re looking for. If you pay attention to the details and structure your application, cover letter, and resume accordingly, you’re more likely to see positive results.\n\n‍\n\nPro Tip: Use the Teal AI Resume Builder and Job Application Tracker to pull the skills, relevant keywords, and other crucial language from any job description. Then, using the same platform, seamlessly incorporate them into your resume to highlight your relevant experience.\n\nHiglighting job description keywords to showcase relevant experience on a resume\nAlign your resume to any job description with the right keywords and language.\n‍\n\n2. Coordinate relevant experience and recent jobs\nPotential employers are more likely to be interested in your recent work experience than in a job you worked at over a decade ago. This is because your most recent work experience is more likely to reflect your current skills and knowledge.\n\nIf your most recent roles align closely with the job you're applying for, emphasize them prominently on your resume. If there's a significant gap between your last relevant role and your current job, consider highlighting transferable skills alongside any metrics and impact and any applicable side projects or freelance work.\n\nBy prioritizing recent experience, you can let potential employers know that your skills and knowledge are still sharp and up-to-date with the times, making you a competitive candidate.\n\n‍\n\n3. Tailor your resume to include relevant experience\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nBy taking the time to tailor your resume to each job you apply for, you give yourself a serious leg-up over the competition.\n\nCustomizing your resume involves:\n\nRephrasing bullet points using keywords that match the job ad\nAdding or omitting certain experiences to better align with the specific job\nAdjusting your professional summary to align with the requirements of the role you're applying to\nEditing your target title to match the title of the job (Note: As long your target title aligns with your experience and qualifications, it doesn't need to be one of your previous job titles.)\nNot only does this approach ensure that you're highlighting the experiences that will appeal to each potential employer, but it can also showcase that you took the time to understand the employer’s needs and are committed to fulfilling them.\n\n‍\n\n4. Highlight achievements and impact over job duties\nJob duties can provide a broad overview of your work experience, but they don’t usually tell the full story. Instead of simply listing your general responsibilities, focus on the impact of those responsibilities.\n\nFor example, rather than just saying that you worked as a project manager and listing your responsibilities, talk about how you successfully led a cross-functional team to complete a project ahead of schedule—or how you increased departmental efficiency by 15%.\n\nListing your job title and job duties only tells employers that you held a certain position and checked a box. But listing your key achievements and corresponding impact tells them that you excelled at that position.\n\nIt’s easy to see how this will be much more appealing to potential employers considering multiple candidates with similar work histories.\n\n‍\n\n5. Review your resume and the job description\nOnce you've completed the steps above, take a moment to compare your resume to the job description. Do you meet at least 70% of the required skills? Does your language align?\n\nIf you want to save time and compare your resume to a job, Teal offers a Matching Mode feature that gives you an analysis of how well your resume aligns with the language, keywords, and skills of the job.\n\nGet Your Match Score\nComparing resume relevant experience to a job description\nCompare your resume to any job description in seconds to make sure they align.\n‍\n\nAdd relevant experience to your resume with Teal\nCustomizing and optimizing the relevant experience on your resume for each new job you apply for can be a powerful way to boost your job search. \n\nIt also requires a lot of time and effort when done manually.\n\nThankfully, Teal’s free AI Resume Builder can help. With Teal, you can build your resume (by importing a previous version, uploading your LinkedIn profile, or from scratch) and then easily customize your content (and cover letter!) to match any job description using the right keywords and language to align your qualifications.\n\n‍\n\nSign up for free today and start using Teal to create, tailor, and manage your resume!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow can I highlight relevant experience on my resume if I'm changing industries?\nCan volunteer work or internships count as relevant experience on a resume?\nHow far back should I go when listing relevant experience on my resume?","Meta Description":"Learn how to display relevant experience on your resume to land interviews."}}]}

Just listing job duties won't make you memorable; you need to spotlight your specific achievements, demonstrate your impact, and quantify your successes. Understanding the intricacies of the US resume format can set you apart, whether you're an experienced pro or just getting started.\nBelow you'll learn the essential elements of a US resume and how to craft each section with precision You'll also find great examples to help you create a standout resume.\nLooking to create a US resume? Teal's free resume maker was built to do just that. Try it today!\n‍\nUnderstanding the US resume format\nCreating a resume tailored to the US job market involves understanding some key elements that distinguish it from other international formats.\nHere are the primary characteristics:\nConcise and focused: US resumes are usually 1-3 pages long.\nAchievement-oriented content: Highlighting accomplishments is essential.\nProfessional layout: A clean and professional appearance is preferred.\nReverse chronological format: Work experience is most commonly listed from most recent to least recent in reverse chronological order.\nRelevant skills and accomplishments: Emphasis is placed on skills and achievements pertinent to the job.\n‍\nStandard sections in a US resume\nA typical US resume includes the following sections:\nContact Information\nTarget Title\nProfessional Summary\nWork Experience\nEducation\nCertifications\nSkills\nOptional Sections (e.g., projects, awards and scholarships, volunteer work, leadership roles, publications)\nIf you're a recent graduate, you can include your academic background with details on degrees earned, institutions attended, and relevant coursework, if applicable. An expansive version of an Education section is more common in other formats like in CV Education sections.\nPro Tip: Unlike some resume builders, every section you need for a complete, comprehensive US resume is part of Teal's platform (along with built-in, step-by-step guidance so you know exactly what you need in each one).\n\n‍\nHow to create a US resume\nCrafting a standout resume is crucial for capturing the attention of hiring managers in the US job market. Here are some key tips to help you create a resume that highlights your strengths and sets you apart from other candidates.\n‍\n1. Choose the right resume format\nSelecting the appropriate resume formatting is crucial for effectively showcasing your qualifications. The three main types are:\nChronological (most common)\nFunctional (skills-based)\nCombination (hybrid of chronological and functional)\n‍\nWhen to use each format:\nChronological: Ideal for those with a consistent work history in a particular field. This is the most popular resume format and highlights your career progression (and is preferred by most US hiring managers and recruiters).\nFunctional: Best for career changers or individuals with gaps in their employment history. It focuses on your skills and accomplishments rather than the timeline of your work experience.\nCombination: A hybrid resume format blends chronological and functional elements. Perfect for industries that focus heavily on tools and tech as well as work experience (like SaaS), allowing you to highlight relevant skills alongside your work history.\n‍\n2.  Opt for a clean design\nThe visual presentation of your resume is important. A cluttered resume can draw attention away from your achievements and skills.\nFollow these design guidelines for good readability:\nUse a clean, professional font (e.g., Poppins, Roboto, Open Sans)\nSet font size between 10-12 points for body text\nUse 0.5 to 1-inch margins\nIncorporate white space for readability\nUse bullet points for easy scanning\nStick to a consistent formatting style throughout\n\n‍\nLeverage resume templates\nUsing a resume template can save time and ensure a professional look.\nBenefits of using templates: Templates offer consistency, professional design, and compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).\nHow to customize templates to stand out: Personalize templates by adjusting colors, fonts, and layout to reflect your personal brand while keeping it professional.\nRecommended resources for professional templates: Many online platforms provide customizable templates (like Teal's ATS-friendly resume templates) that adhere to US resume standards.\n‍\n3.  Include an accurate Contact section\nYour Contact section is the first thing employers see, it's also how they reach you to schedule an interview. Because of this, these details should be up-to-date and accurate.\nYour Contact section should include:\nFull name\nProfessional email address\nPhone number\nLocation (city and state)\nLinkedIn profile URL (optional)\nPersonal website or portfolio (if relevant)\n‍\nTips for a professional Contact section\nAvoid using nicknames\nUse a professional email format (e.g., firstname.lastname@email.com)\nEnsure all information is up-to-date and accurate\n‍\n4. Add a target title\nYour target title isn't about stating your last job title. It's about showing you understand the job you're applying for.\nYour Target Title section should be tailored to each specific job application, meaning it may change for every job.\nOne of the first things a recruiter searches for in the ATS is the name of the position they're trying to fill. Including a target title that matches this makes it easier for them to find your resume.\n‍\n5. Write a strong professional summary\nA strong resume summary can grab the attention of a hiring manager and encourage them to read the rest of your resume.\nHere’s how to craft an effective summary:\n3-4 sentences highlighting your key qualifications\nTailor to the specific job you’re applying for\nInclude years of experience, key skills, and most notable achievements\nUse strong action verbs and job-specific keywords\n‍\n6. Showcase relevant work experience\nAfter your professional summary, you'll incorporate your Work Experience section. Your work history is the heartbeat of your resume. It’s where you make your case and show potential employers what you’re truly capable of.\nHere’s how to present it in the most compelling way:\nList jobs in reverse chronological order\nInclude company name, job title, dates of employment, and location\nUse 3-5 bullet points per role to highlight key resume achievements that align with the job you're applying for\nStart with strong action verbs (e.g., \"Spearheaded,\" \"Implemented,\" \"Optimized\")\nUse the PAR (Problem-Action-Result) method to structure your achievements\nFocus on quantifiable results and specific accomplishments\nIncorporate keywords that are relevant to the job\nFor example:\n\"Implemented a new customer service protocol, reducing response times by 30% and increasing customer satisfaction scores from 85% to 95%.\"\n‍\n7. Include education\nYour Education section provides context for your qualifications and can be especially important for recent graduates or those with limited work experience. Here’s how to present it effectively:\nDegrees listed in reverse chronological order\nInstitution name, degree earned, and graduation date\nRelevant coursework, academic achievements, or GPA if impressive (3.5 or higher) if you're a recent graduate\n‍\nEducation section for recent graduates\nPlace education before work experience if you're a recent graduate or have limited professional experience\nInclude relevant projects, thesis work, or extracurricular activities that demonstrate skills applicable to the job\nHighlight academic honors, scholarships, or leadership roles in student organizations\n‍\n8. Certifications\nCertifications help you further align your credentials with the qualifications employers are looking for.\nHere are best practices for including certifications in your resume to demonstrate your expertise:\nKeep it relevant: List certifications that are pertinent to the job you’re applying for to show you have the specific skills and knowledge required.\nProvide details: Include the name of the certification, the certifying body, and the date obtained.\nUse a consistent format: Make sure your certification entries follow a consistent format to maintain a professional appearance.\nPrioritize recent and advanced certifications: Highlight the most recent and advanced certifications at the top of this section to emphasize your current qualifications.\n‍\n9. Showcase your skills\nA well-crafted Skills section can set you apart from other candidates. Tailor your skills list to the job requirements, emphasizing those most relevant to the position.\nWhile a Skills section is valuable for showcasing your hard skills, it's also important to sprinkle them throughout your resume (alongside soft skills) to show how you achieved impact.\n‍\n10. Add optional sections to stand out\nIncluding optional sections can improve your resume and make you stand out in a crowded field. If any of these are relevant to the position you're applying for and add value to your US resume, consider adding sections for:\nProjects\nAwards and Scholarships\nVolunteer work\nLeadership roles\nPublications\n‍\nTailoring your US resume for each application\nOne of the most important aspects of a US resume is customizing it for the job you're applying to. A tailored resume shows you have the skills and qualifications for a specific job. Incorporating the right information also helps your resume get found by recruiters searching the ATS for specific experience.\nFollow these steps to ensure your resume resonates with each job application:\nAnalyze the job description\nIdentify key requirements and qualifications\nExtract relevant keywords and phrases\nCustomize your resume content\nAdjust your professional summary to align with the role\nHighlight relevant achievements (with impact) in your work experience\nEmphasize skills that match the language of the job requirements\nCompare your resume to the JD\nUse Teal's Match Score feature to compare your resume against the job description.\nImprove your alignment by following the keyword suggestions\n‍\n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid in US resumes\nWhile highlighting your skills and experience is important, it's equally essential to avoid common mistakes that can detract from your application.\nTo ensure your resume makes a strong impression, steer clear of these pitfalls:\nIncluding personal information (e.g., age, marital status, photo)\nUsing a resume objective statement\nIncluding references or \"References available upon request\"\nListing every job you've ever had\nUsing passive language or clichés\nNeglecting to proofread for errors\n‍\n\n‍\nOptimizing your US resume for 2024 job market trends\nThe job market is evolving, and staying ahead of the curve is crucial. Here’s how to tailor your resume for 2024’s trends to stand out:\nIncorporate remote work experience\nAs remote work becomes more prevalent:\nHighlight virtual collaboration skills\nDemonstrate adaptability and self-motivation\nShowcase achievements in remote or hybrid work environments\nExample: \"Led a remote team of 10, increasing productivity by 20% through effective virtual communication and project management.\"\nEmphasize digital literacy and tech skills\nIn an increasingly digital workplace job seekers like you can focus on:\nShowcase proficiency in relevant software and tools\nHighlight experience with digital transformation initiatives\nDemonstrate ability to learn and adapt to new technologies quickly\nExample: \"Implemented a new CRM system, resulting in a 25% increase in sales efficiency.\"\n‍\nBest practices for a winning US resume\nCreating a good US resume involves some guidelines to ensure it aligns with modern standards. A well-crafted US resume connects your previous experience to the job you're applying for in a clean format that hiring managers and recruiters are familiar with.\n‍\n‍\nHere are a few tips to consider:\nUse a concise, achievement-oriented format: Highlight specific accomplishments and results to show your value prop clearly.\nCustomize your resume for each application: Tailor your resume to emphasize relevant skills and accomplishments that match the job posting, showing your right fit for the role.\nMaintain a clean and professional design: Ensure your resume is well-organized, with clear headings and bullet points, using a professional font to make it easy to read.\nUse strong action verbs: Start bullet points with action verbs to convey your contributions and impact effectively.\nIncorporate relevant keywords: Include industry-specific keywords and phrases from the job description so recruiters are able to find your resume when searching the ATS.\nKeep your resume up-to-date: Regularly update your resume with recent achievements, skills, and experiences to ensure it accurately reflects your qualifications (and so you're never left scrambling when you find an opportunity).\n‍\nCreate a US resume with Teal\nBuilding a standout US resume is key to making a strong first impression.

In comparison, customers of Teal’s all-in-one AI Resume Builder loved its features for customizing resumes to unique job postings and for its flexible pricing options.\nNavigating the job market is overwhelming. That’s why job seekers rely on professional resume writers to craft or update their resumes for job postings. Resume writers offer personalized feedback, rewriting help, and, often, assistance with your cover letter.\nThis article explores reviews of TopResume, summarizes common themes from customer reviews, and  considers whether it’s the best option for creating or updating a resume.\nWhat is TopResume?\nTopResume is a professional resume writing service that provides a free resume critique and paid options for resume writing, cover-letter writing, and more.\n‍\nTopResume provides professional resume writing, cover-letter writing, and additional features like a resume review, upgrades to LinkedIn profiles, and more.\nTopResume provides detailed feedback on your current resume to help impress hiring managers, such as how you’re highlighting accomplishments from past jobs, formatting your resume for visual appeal, and using language that demands attention.\nTheir resume writers also work with you one-on-one through feedback and revisions to optimize your resume, improve your cover letter and even update your LinkedIn profile.\nTopResume has three core offerings:\nA free resume review, with specific examples for improvement.\nA service that involves submitting a questionnaire about your needs and your background and communicating via revisions with a professional resume writer who will rewrite your resume.\nAdd-on services such as a 48-hour turnaround time, a rewrite of your cover letter, a “LinkedIn Makeover,” interview coaching, resume distribution to recruiters and more.\nSome users felt their own resume was better than the one provided by TopResume, citing a lack of effort or originality in the professional service.\nTopResume also offers an “Elite Executive Priority Package” for business executives, which includes more professional resume-writing support and many of the add-ons mentioned above.\nBut how does TopResume hold up based on customer reviews? And how do its customers feel about its resume writers, its customer support and pricing?\nAnd does TopResume stand up to AI resume builders like Teal?\nWe looked at reviews of TopResume and compared them to Teal reviews to see how satisfied users were with the popular resume writing service compared to an AI resume builder.\n‍\nTopResume reviews on Trustpilot\n3.9 / 5 star\nOn Trustpilot, TopResume has an average score of 3.9 out of five stars, based on over 13,000 reviews from customers.\nGenerally, a score below four isn’t overly respectable, demonstrating below-excellent customer satisfaction. However, a noticeable share of TopResume's reviews are positive.\nLooking through the five-star reviews of TopResume, it’s clear that some people appreciated the work done by the resume writer assigned to them by TopResume. For instance, TopResume user Elizabeth said Mason from TopResume “responded quickly and worked efficiently.”\n‍\nBut these appear to be subjective experiences largely dependent on the particular resume writer job seekers get assigned from TopResume.\nAccording to many lukewarm or even negative reviews of TopResume, not all resume writers are as quick and efficient as Mason.\nFor example, from these two anonymous customers below, although they were still ultimately satisfied with the quality of work done, they felt the turnaround times were unnecessarily long and the communication with the resume writer lacking. A member of the support team often had to step in to address these customer complaints\nOne of the reviewers even commented that paying extra for a guaranteed 48-hour delivery of your resume would probably be a good idea because “the lapse between communications was a bit long at times.”\n‍\n‍\nOther Trustpilot reviewers of TopResume had a gripe with the add-on services, while still being sufficiently satisfied with the quality of their resume.\n\n‍\nFor instance, in the below example, this reviewer felt that paying for add-ons didn’t generate a positive return on their investment, noting how the resume-distribution option to recruiters just felt like a regular subscription to a basic recruiting service.\nTo provide some additional context, the reviewer wondered if TopResume was just a subscription to Career.io, which is TopResume’s parent company. All customers get a Career.io subscription, but TopResume’s specific subscription add-on for resume distribution is powered by the company Recruiter.com.\n‍‍\nAs for the LinkedIn add-on, which is a professional rewrite of your LinkedIn profile, the below reviewer felt the service wasn’t unique enough to warrant an additional cost.\n‍‍\nFinally, the three-star reviews of TopResume present a mixed bag of opinions on the quality of the resume.\nIn the below examples, one reviewer wasn’t happy the first draft of their resume was done poorly, and the other disclosed the resume TopResume wrote didn’t yield any job interviews, even commenting that the resume-distribution add-on was more of a nuisance than a benefit.\n‍\n‍\n‍\nTopResume reviews on X\nOn X (formerly Twitter), there aren’t many customer complaints. However, one customer gave TopResume a simple recommendation.\nIt seems as if this anonymous reviewer got a few more callbacks for interviews after using TopResume’s free resume review—but there’s no indication they used any of TopResume’s paid services for a resume update.\n‍\n‍\nTopResume reviews on Reddit\nOn Reddit, another anonymous reviewer is satisfied with the early stages of the resume review—but again, there’s no evidence they’ve gone in-depth with TopResume’s paid resume service.\n\n‍\nThough not all Reddit reviews reflect a positive experience.\nWhen it comes to TopResume’s “Elite Executive Priority Package”—rewrites for all three of a resume, a cover letter and a LinkedIn profile, plus two interview-prep sessions and a 30-day Career.io subscription—one customer didn’t get their resume in the promised turnaround time.\n‍\n\nTopResume reviews on Quora\nAnd over on Quora, another job seeker felt the Elite Executive Priority Resume Package was even more underwhelming, because of missed deadlines for the first draft, poor quality and an unresolved refund request.\n‍\n‍\nTopResume pricing\nMost noticeably, reviews of TopResume consistently bemoaned the financial value of the add-on services, especially the Elite Executive Priority Package, feeling the TopResume cost for these services aren’t worth it. This dissatisfaction highlights the importance of prioritizing customer satisfaction in relation to the services offered.\n‍\n‍\nTopResume pricing starts at $149 for a basic resume. TopResume also offers more-expensive packages that feature add-ons like cover-letter and LinkedIn-profile rewrites. All packages provide a Career.io subscription and promise a job interview within 60 days—however, some job seekers who wrote reviews of TopResume said they received no interview callbacks. In response to complaints about pricing, a member of their support team often reaches out to assist and address concerns.\n‍\n‍\nThe TopResume price for its most-expensive package is $699, which includes not only a rewrite of your resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn profile, but also a Career.io subscription, interview prep, a promised two-day turnaround time, and a guarantee your resume writer is rated in the top one percent in their network. However, multiple TopResume reviews communicated that this executive package is overpriced for what customers get.\n‍\nTopResume review summary\nIf you’re considering TopResume’s resume-writing service to help get more callbacks for interviews, it seems you might get mixed results in terms of customer satisfaction.\nTopResume reviews: Pros\nSatisfactory free resume reviews\nDecent final quality of resume rewrites\nHelpful communication from writers\nTopResume reviews: Cons\nOften longer-than-promised turnaround times\nHigh-quality resume usually take multiple drafts\nPoor value in add-on services and the executive package\nAlthough most job seekers who paid for a resume writer from TopResume were eventually satisfied with the quality, many said the first drafts weren’t up to par and required extensive feedback. Some users even felt their own resume was better than the one provided by TopResume. And many others were upset with how long the process took relative to expectations.\n‍\nWho is TopResume best for?\nBased on customer reviews of TopResume, it’s clear there's some value to this resume service for some, but TopResume isn’t a great fit for everyone. Customer satisfaction varies widely, with some users expressing extreme dissatisfaction due to ignored feedback, lack of response from writers, and inadequate document revisions.\nBased on the reviews, TopResume’s free resume review is worth it, as most reviewers felt their resume reviews were detailed and helpful. Because this doesn’t cost a penny, you’ve got nothing to lose by giving it a spin. The free resume critique is particularly valuable for entry-level job seekers who need basic feedback.\nHowever, many reviewers impressed by the resume-rewrite quality, as indicated on social media, were looking for non-advanced jobs in areas like data entry or insurance sales. Customers further along in their careers who paid for the executive package weren’t happy with the quality level.\nAnd even the job seekers who were satisfied with the quality of their resume found that the turnaround times were often needlessly long and they had to give lots of feedback to the resume writers.\nTherefore, TopResume is best for job seekers looking for entry-level roles in areas like accounting, customer service, data entry, and retail sales along with those who only need basic feedback on their resumes from professional resume writers. Job seekers with lots of experience looking for advanced positions or anyone who needs quick service to apply for jobs quickly should turn elsewhere.\nWhat’s more, TopResume doesn’t provide any support for helping to find job postings, tailor your resume for specific postings, or organize your job applications. Reviewers felt TopResume’s resume-distribution add-on service via Recruiter.com wasn’t helpful for networking with recruiters.\nShould you consider a resume-builder tool like Teal that helps you through every stage of the application process? Here’s a comparison of Teal reviews to TopResume reviews to help you decide.\n‍\nTeal reviews vs TopResume reviews\nUnlike reviews of TopResume, Teal reviews show its users love the add-on services because they provide tangible value for job seekers.\nFor example, with Teal’s Chrome extension—which is a free add-on—you can import job postings to customize your resume and do side-by-side comparisons of resumes and postings.\nPlus Teal has many positive reviews in the Chrome Web Store, like the below examples, with 4.9 stars out of 5 from over 2,800 reviews.\n‍\n\n‍\n\n‍\nTeal customers also love the AI functionality, which crafts custom resume sections based on keywords from specific job postings.\nTeal also provides a resume score called a Match Score to let you know how well your resume stacks up to a job posting.\nThis means instead of receiving a single, generic rewrite of your resume, Teal’s AI customizes your resume for the job you’re applying to, which helped job seekers like Mark cut his application time by 60 percent and land his dream gig, as seen in his review of Teal below.\n‍\n\n‍\nLastly, Teal customers appreciate the value they get.\nFrom TopResume reviews, many job seekers questioned the cost and struggled to get refunds when they weren’t satisfied.\nBut reviews of Teal demonstrate that users love the value of Teal’s services and even the pricing transparency about recurring payments, as shown below in Amanda’s review.\n‍\n\n‍\nWhy job seekers prefer Teal\nWhen comparing TopResume to Teal, Teal stands out for its features in helping you craft a resume tailored to the unique jobs you’re applying to and for its flexible pricing options that don’t make job seekers feel like they’re overpaying.\nWith flexible pricing, Teal offers:\nA generous free plan\nWeekly pricing options\nHassle-free cancellations\n‍\nTeal vs TopResume cost\nTeal+: $9/week or $29/month\nTopResume: One-time costs that range between $149 and $699, plus options to buy add-ons à la carte\nTopResume offers a money-back guarantee if their resume work doesn’t help you get a job interview within 60 days.\nHowever, Teal offers flexibility because customers have to opt in to auto-renew subscriptions. That way, you never pay for something you’re not using.\nPlus, it’d take a full five months of using Teal even to surpass the base cost of TopResume’s entry-level package, which only includes a single resume improvement (and a 30-day Career.io subscription).\nWith Teal, you get so much more, including an AI Resume Builder, a Job Application Tracker, and access to a \n‍\nTeal offers more for your resume\nWhat truly sets Teal apart is its all-in-one approach to personalized job hunting to help job seekers advance their career and find the perfect job, just like Ashleigh and Oshen.\nNot only does Teal offer AI resume and cover letter creation, it also includes:\nResume Analysis so you don’t miss any key details\nA Job Application Tracker to organize your search every step of the way\nContacts and Company Trackers help you remember who you know from where\nEmail follow-up templates and reminders so you never miss a follow-up again\nWorld-class tech support to lean on if you get stuck\nA Match Score to ensure your resume aligns with every role\n‍\n‍\nTeal's AI guides you in crafting a strong narrative throughout your resume, cover letter, and emails along with keeping track of every job application so nothing falls through the cracks.

But while it might sound straightforward, your contact section isn’t a throwaway. Much like the rest of your resume, it deserves some attention to confirm you’re sharing these important details in a way that’s accurate, organized, easy for hiring managers, and a positive reflection of you. \n\nReady to optimize the contact section of your resume? This article covers everything job seekers need to know about adding contact details to your resume.\n\nWhy is contact information important on a resume?\nWhile it might seem basic, your contact information section contains some of the most important information of your resume: your name and the best ways for hiring managers or recruiters to get in touch. \n\nA well-organized and intuitive resume contact section is helpful in your job search because it: \n\nMakes it easy for potential employers to reach out and update you on the hiring process\nProvides your full name so employers can look for you online (which most recruiters will do)\nClarifies your current location, which is important for location-specific roles\nReinforces your professional brand as a polished, detail-oriented candidate\nThis seemingly unassuming and inconsequential section holds more power than you’d think in your job search.\n\nWhat contact information should you include on your resume?\nHere’s the question you inevitably have next: What counts as contact information? What should you include on your resume?\n\nAt a minimum, here are the professional details you need to list on your resume:\n\nYour first and last name\nThis should be the very first thing on your resume, listed at the top in big, bold letters. If you’re curious about whether to include a middle name or your preferred name, here are the quick answers:\n\nInclude your middle name only if that’s what you go by (for example, “Mary Ann”)\nInclude your preferred name as your only name or in quotations or parentheses. Example: Elizabeth (Betsy) Scott\nNote: You’ll find more details about each of those circumstances in the FAQ section at the bottom. \n\n‍\n\nYour email address\nList an email address that potential employers can use to reach out to you. Make sure it’s a professional email address (now is not the time to use the funny one you set up in college) and is one that you check frequently so that you don’t miss any updates or outreach.\n\nDo: timothyjones@gmail.com‍\nDon’t: bananaman1234@AOL.com\n(No offense, AOL.)\n\nThere’s some debate over whether or not to hyperlink your email address on your resume. While there’s not a hard and fast rule here, the safest option is to not add a clickable link.\n\n‍\n\nYour phone number\nMost employers will use your phone number to get in touch, with a surprising amount using text messages to communicate with job applicants. List your personal cell phone number (you don’t want potential employers calling your current employer) including the area code. If you’re from the U.S. and applying for a job in another country, add the +1 U.S. dial code before your area code.\n\n‍\n\nYour location\nCompared to everything else, figuring out how to write addresses on your resume is the trickiest part. Should you include your full mailing address? Or is it risky and unnecessary to list your home address?\n\n‍\n\nRecommended contact information for resume\nThe general recommendation is to include your city and state (for example, New York, NY), as employers need that information when considering you for location-specific positions. \n\nThere’s no reason to include your full mailing address on your resume. If employers need your mailing address at some point in the process, they will ask.\n\nYour street address shares exactly where you live, and you probably don’t want that level of identifying information floating around, increasing your risk of identity theft. So, stick with your city and state on your resume and share your mailing address later in the process, or directly within a secure application.\n\nThose are the must-have contact details. However, there are other optional pieces of contact information you can include as well.\n\n‍\n\nOptional contact information for resume\nYour LinkedIn URL\n‍Especially if you have a common name, including the URL to your LinkedIn profile, ensures a hiring manager finds the right person when they look. Pro Tip: Make sure to clean up your link before listing it (for example, www.linkedin.com/in/loganroy rather than www.linkedin.com/in/193i5u3i35ui2o352ou3). You can easily make that adjustment by viewing your profile page and clicking the pencil icon next to “Public profile & URL” on the right side.\n\n‍‍\n\nYour professional title\n‍Including a professional title with your contact information makes it immediately clear to employers what you do and what role you’re targeting. This doesn’t necessarily need to be your most recent job title. If you’re searching for an email marketing role, then include a resume title like “Email Marketing Professional” with your name and contact info.\n\n‍‍\n\nAdditional social media accounts\n‍If you work in a field like marketing where social media is relevant, including your social media links or handles gives employers more opportunities to learn about you and your expertise.\n\n‍‍\n\nYour professional website\n‍If you have an online portfolio or personal website, including a link to that with your personal info can give the HR manager more information and help you stand out from the many job seekers that are likely applying for that role.\n\n‍\n\nPreferred name\nYou could also include your preferred name, middle name or initial, or any professional credentials you’ve achieved.\n\n‍\n\nWhat not to include in your contact information section\nWhile there are plenty of things you need to include, there’s also some information that you absolutely should not list in this section (or anywhere else on your document):\n\n‍\n\nA fax number\n‍Faxes aren’t necessary or common during the hiring process (or in general).\n\n‍\n\nMultiple email addresses or phone numbers\n‍This is a good way to confuse recruiters about which one to use to reach you.\n\n‍\n\nSensitive information like your social security number\n‍Much like listing your address, this can increase your chances of identity theft. Never include this in your resume.\n\n‍\n\nHow to list contact information on resumes\nNow that you know what to include, where should you put it? All of the contact information on resumes goes in a specific resume section called the resume header. This is the topmost section of your document, where most recruiters will look for your important details. \n\nHere are a few resume formatting tips to keep in mind as you lay out your resume header:\n\nMake your name the biggest and boldest text on your document so it stands out from everything else.\nSeparate your contact info with bullets, separate lines, or other dividers so the information doesn’t run together.\nInclude your target professional title, either in your header or directly underneath.\nListing your contact information is even easier when you use Teal's resume creator. Enter your details into the “contact information” section and then use the checkboxes to select which contact information should appear on your resume.\n\n\nCreate Your Free Resume with AI\nWithin the “design” section, you can click through the different templates to find the best resume format for you and adjust how your resume header appears on your document.\n\n‍\n\nHere’s what your contact information should look like when it’s polished up and ready to go:\n\nresume contact information on resume\nAlways include your contact information at the top of your resume\n‍\n\nPro Tip: When you write your cover letter, you can use the same header with all the same details at the top of your cover letter. That way, your career documents match and look like a branded package. Plus, it’s helpful if your resume and cover letter become separated. If you need some inspiration, check out these short cover letter examples. \n\n‍\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid when listing contact information on a resume\nThis section is pretty self-explanatory. However, there are a few common mistakes you should watch out for as you pull together your contact info. Here are a few contact information “don’ts” to keep in mind:\n\nDon’t list unprofessional or inactive email addresses\nDon’t include unnecessary information like your mailing address or fax numbers\nDon’t list your contact details in hard-to-find spots, like at the bottom of your resume\nDon’t forget to clean up your social media profiles before including them on your resume\nDon’t neglect to double-check all of your contact information to fix any typos or errors\n‍\n\nMake your resume contact information clear with Teal\nAdding your contact information to your resume is probably the easiest and fastest part of the entire resume process. But it’s still important to do it right and make sure your details are displayed clearly and prominently at the top of your document (where most recruiters will look for them).\n\nTeal's resume maker can help. Just input your contact information, choose your favorite resume format, and you’re well on your way to creating a resume that impresses the hiring manager and gets you one step closer to landing the job. \n\nReady to build a better resume?

Chronological resume \nThe chronological resume format (or reverse chronological resume format) is the most popular. This layout emphasizes your most recent work experience first.\n\nUsing this format is super straightforward—list your experience, starting with your most recent position, and work backward.\n\n‍\n\nHow to format a chronological resume\n In a chronological resume, each job entry includes the job title, company name, dates of employment, and key bullets with impact relevant to the position you're applying for. This gives potential employers a clear picture of your work experience and your contributions in previous roles.\n\n‍\n\nA chronological resume format includes the following sections in this order:\n\nContact Information\nTarget Title\nProfessional Summary \nWork Experience\nEducation\nCertifications\nSkills\nOptional\n– Projects\n– Awards and Scholarships\n– Volunteering and Leadership\n– Publications\n‍\n\nHow is a chronological resume organized?\nThe chronological resume is organized by time, with the most recent experiences listed first.\n\nThe core of this organizational style is the Work Experience section, where each job is presented in reverse chronological order to showcase a clear timeline of your career progression.\n\nThis meticulous structure helps employers quickly understand your background, accomplishments, growth trajectory, and the skills you bring to the table.\n\n‍\n\nWhen to use a chronological resume format\nA reverse-chronological resume format is ideal when you have a solid, continuous work history in a specific field. It's the most common resume format, so hiring professionals are most familiar with it.\n\nIt's great for showcasing your career growth and highlighting your relevant experiences.\n\nChoose this format to emphasize your consistent work history and progression in a particular industry.\n\nHowever, this format might not be the best choice for everyone. If you have large employment gaps or are switching careers, a different resume format might be better for highlighting your relevant skills and experiences.\n\n‍\n\nExample resume format - chronological resume  \nAn example of a chronological resume format\nThis example resume uses the chronological resume format to show the most recent experience first.    \n‍\n\nFree Reverse-Chronological Templates\n‍\n\n2. Functional resume \nThe functional resume format, also known as the skills-based resume, focuses on your skills, experience, and achievements rather than your work history. \n\nIt's designed to showcase your most relevant skills that align with a specific job instead of listing job titles and work experience. And while your work history is briefly mentioned with minimal details, the primary focus of a functional resume template is your skill set group.\n\nA functional format can be helpful for those just starting out, anyone with gaps in their employment history, career changers, or individuals with limited work experience. Just be aware that some employers might be skeptical of functional resumes because they don't offer a clear timeline of your work history. \n\n‍\n\nView our Functional Resume Templates\n‍\n\nHow to format a functional resume\n In a functional resume, the more expansive Work History section is replaced with a Skills section focusing on three or four skills with achievements and impact (in the form of resume bullet points). These skills should always be relevant to the position you're applying for—giving potential employers a clear picture of how you used them in previous roles.\n\n‍\n\nA functional or skills-based resume format generally includes the following sections:\n\nContact Information\nTarget Title\nProfessional Summary\nSkills (with achievements and impact)\nEmployment History (if applicable)\nEducation\nCertifications\nOptional\n– Projects\n– Awards and Scholarships\n– Volunteering and Leadership\n– Publications\n‍\n\nHow is a functional resume organized?\nThe functional resume format focuses on organizing skills and prioritizing your top aptitudes that align with a specific job.\n\nThe core of this organizational style is the Skills section. Each skill is presented clearly, followed by resume bullet points that outline the ways you used that specific ability to have an impact.\n\nThis structure helps employers quickly understand how your competencies align directly with the needs of the position they're trying to fill.\n\n‍\n\nWhen to use a functional resume format\nA functional resume format is a fine option for job seekers just starting out, those with gaps in their employment history, or anyone making a career change.\n\nAs this professional resume format emphasizes your skills and abilities rather than your work history, it's a good way to showcase transferable skills and demonstrate your value to a new employer.\n\nWhen choosing between a functional vs. chronological resume, remember while a functional resume can be a great way to emphasize skills and accomplishments, it's important to consider the potential pros and cons of not showing your comprehensive work history before committing to this format.\n\n‍\n\nExample resume format - functional resume  \nAn example of a functional resume format\nThis example resume uses a functional resume format to highlight relevant skills.\n‍\n\n3. Combination resume \nThe combination resume format (also called a hybrid resume format) combines chronological and functional formats.\n\nIt's designed to showcase your work history and specific abilities, making it a great professional resume template for those who want to focus on hard skills and work history.\n\nThe combination or hybrid resume is particularly helpful if you want to highlight your specific expertise while also mapping out your career progression. It's especially great for those in industries focusing heavily on tools, software, technical expertise, or specific methodologies.\n\n‍\n\nPro Tip: If you're trying to decide between a combination resume and another format, Tealets you quickly build a hybrid-style resume using the Drag-and-Drop Editor. This way, you can decide what works best for you without having to manually format your content (and then manually reformatting it if you don't love what you see).\n\n‍\n\nCustomizing a resume format with Teal\nChange the order (and name) of your resume sections in one click.\n‍\n\nHow to format a combination resume\nIn a combination resume, your work history is presented in reverse chronological order, just like the chronological format.\n\nHowever, because it's a hybrid between the two other formats, rather than putting skills at the bottom, a combination resume also focuses on skills by listing them directly beneath the professional summary and above your work experience.\n\n‍\n\nA combination or hybrid resume format generally includes the following sections:\n\nContact information\nProfessional Summary\nSkills\nWork Experience\nEducation\nCertifications\nSkills\nOptional\n– Projects\n– Awards and Scholarships\n– Volunteering and Leadership\n– Publications\n‍\n\nHow is a combination resume organized?  \nThe combination resume is organized by skills and work experience, focusing on your top skills and relevant work history that align with a specific job description.\n\nThe core of this organizational style is the layout. A list of skills (preferably hard skills) is presented clearly, followed by work experience with resume bullet points outlining your achievements and impact in specific roles.\n\nThis structure helps employers quickly view your skills without taking emphasis away from your background, accomplishments, and growth trajectory.       \n\n‍\n\nWhen to use a combination resume format\nA combination resume format is the perfect blend of chronological and functional resumes.\n\nIt's ideal for those with a mix of experiences or a combination of work history and specific skills. This format is a great option if you want to emphasize both history and skills, presenting a well-rounded picture of your professional background.\n\n‍\n\nExample resume format - combination resume\nAn example of a combination resume format\n This example resume  uses a combination resume format to highlight your relevant skills while focusing on work experience.\n‍\n\nChoose a resume format with Teal\nWith Teal's flexible resume design, you can change your resume format in just a few clicks.

Each example gives you a professional resume broken down by professional title and experience. \n\nTeal's resume format examples\nFind a sample resume format for your specific role.\n‍\n\nWhat is the best resume format if you don’t have work experience?\nWriting a resume with no relevant work experience offers the chance to highlight the skills and strengths you've developed in other areas of your life. The resume format you choose should provide an opportunity to showcase your potential, adaptability, and diverse experiences that have shaped your unique skill set.\n\n‍\n\nBenefits of a functional resume format for no work experience\nIf you're a job seeker with little or no experience, a functional or skills-based resume might be one of the better resume format options.\n\nA functional resume will help you emphasize transferable skills over work history, which is more ideal for those with limited job experience. You can showcase relevant skills and experiences from other aspects of your life, like volunteer work and academic accomplishments.\n\nIf you'd rather stick to a more traditional resume format, you can also swap your Work Experience section for a more comprehensive Education section that includes relevant courses or projects.\n\n‍\n\nResume example with no work experience\nAn example resume format for no work experience\nUse a functional format to focus on skills and less on work history.\n‍\n\nWhat to love about this resume\nFirst, you’ll note that the resume summary or short professional bio still focuses on what this candidate has done rather than talking about their professional goals or objectives.\n\nThe use of data, numbers, and metrics in the Skills section indicates this applicant has the proper training, knowledge, and hands-on experience to be considered for an interview.\n\nBut it's worth noting that as Ayesha Patel gains more work experience, this resume would ideally change to a chronological or hybrid format.\n\n‍\n\nBest resume formats for pivoting careers\nWhen pivoting careers, a functional resume can be useful as it allows you to highlight relevant skills. However, a hybrid resume is often more effective, blending your skills and experiences with a concise work history.\n\nThis combination resume format showcases not only your qualifications and abilities in new areas but also provides context with your career progression, making it a strong choice for career transitions.\n\n‍\n\nBenefits of a combination format when pivoting careers \nA combination format enables you to showcase transferable skills and relevant work experience.\n\nThis format is great for career pivots, as it demonstrates your previous experience while emphasizing transferable skills applicable to your new career path.\n\n‍\n\nExample resume format for a career pivot\nAn example resume format for a career pivot\nUse a combination resume format to focus on work history and transferable skills.\n‍\n\nWhat to love about this resume\nThis candidate focuses on the transferable skills they have that align with a specific job while being clear about relevant certifications and work history.\n\nThis simple resume format is clear and easy to scan, and it highlights the right skills and experience for a prospective new position.\n\n‍\n\nBest resume formats for creative roles\nCreative roles are inherently dynamic and multifaceted. A creative resume template that focuses on both what you've done and how you've done it provides a more comprehensive look at your qualifications.\n\n‍\n\nBenefits of a chronological resume format for a creative role\nA chronological format is probably your best bet if you're a job seeker in a creative position.\n\nCreative roles often prioritize a traditional work history and a portfolio of your work. A chronological resume lets you highlight your experiences tailored to the job you're after, while a separate portfolio showcases your skills.\n\n‍\n\nExample resume format for creative roles\nAn example resume format for creative roles\nUse a chronological resume format to focus on creative work history.\n‍\n\nSign Up, It's Free\n‍\n\nWhat to love about this resume\nThis resume reveals an accomplished person in a creative field by highlighting a consistent and progressive work history.\n\nIn other words, it balances creativity with professionalism, showing hiring managers that while this person is a creative spirit, they're a serious candidate who has made an impact in other positions.\n\nPro Tip: When you're applying for a position in a creative field, remember to include your portfolio URL at the top of your resume in your contact information. Your portfolio is where your creativity will shine brightest.\n\n‍\n\nBest resume formats for technical roles \nFor technical roles, the best resume formats emphasize proficiency in tools, software, and technical methodologies.\n\nA reverse-chronological format that highlights your most recent technical experiences and projects can be effective. But, combining this with elements of a functional resume to create a hybrid format, where specific technical skills, tools, and software are also prominently displayed, ensures that your expertise aligns with more specific tech requirements.\n\n‍\n\nBenefits of using a hybrid format for a technical role  \nUsing a hybrid resume format for technical roles merges the structured detail of your work history with a focused showcase of your tech skills.\n\nThis approach not only highlights various tools and technologies but also contextualizes them within your professional journey. It provides a balanced view, demonstrating how your technical capabilities have been applied and developed through your career, catering specifically to the nuanced needs of technical positions.\n\n‍\n\nExample hybrid resume format for a technical role\nAn example resume format for technical roles\nUse a hybrid resume format to focus on your tech stack and work experience.\n‍\n\nWhat to love about this resume\nThis resume reveals an accomplished person in a technical field. It highlights the right tools and tech for someone in this position alongside a consistent and progressive work history.\n\nIn other words, it balances tools and professionalism, showing hiring managers that this person has the right experience and skills for the job.\n\n‍\n\nBest resume formats for senior-level positions\nFor senior-level positions, your resume format should chronicle your career progression and highlight the strategic impact of your contributions. Think of it as a document that tells the story of your leadership, decision-making, and the significant results you've driven.\n\n‍\n\nBenefits of using a chronological format for a senior-level position\nFor senior-level and executive positions, a chronological resume is best because it clearly outlines leadership experience, measurable bullets, and relevant skills and qualifications—demonstrating your ability to lead and make strategic decisions. This format prioritizes work history and career progression, important for roles requiring a solid record of success and leadership.\n\n‍\n\nHowever, keep in mind it's important to prioritize professional achievements from roles within the last ten to fifteen years to:\n\nEmphasize your most recent accomplishments\nFocus on experience that's relevant to the position\nKeep your resume as concise as possible\n‍\n\nExample resume format for a senior-level position\nAn example resume for a senior-level position\nUse a chronological resume format for a senior-level position.\n‍\n\nWhat to love about this resume\nIn concise, bullet-point form, this reverse chronological resume shows the measurable impact this candidate had at previous companies.\n\nWithout being too long or over the top, all of the information is scannable and easy to digest, perfect for any hiring manager to review easily.\n\n‍\n\nResume format best practices\nReady to format your resume? Here are some best practices for getting it right.\n\n‍\n\n1. Keep it simple and easy to read\nKeeping your resume simple and easy to read is important to ensure that hiring managers can quickly understand your qualifications.\n\nTo do this:\n\nWrite with a clean and easy-to-read resume font, such as Arial or Times New Roman\nmake sure the font size is large enough to be easily read, typically between 10 and 12 points\nKeep the formatting consistent throughout the document\nUse consistent font, font size, and formatting for headings, bullet points, and other text\n‍\n\n2. Use bullet points\nBullet points are an excellent way to make your resume more readable and user-friendly.\n\nThey allow the reader to scan your resume and identify key information. Use them to list your:\n\nSkills\nProfessional achievements with impact\nMultiple certifications or degrees\nWhen using achievements for professional bullet points, begin each with a strong action verb and use specific examples.\n\n‍\n\n3. Be consistent \nConsistency helps to create a cohesive document and makes it easier for hiring managers to read and understand your qualifications.\n\nEnsure consistent formatting for headings, font sizes, and bullet points. Use the same font, font size, and formatting throughout the document.\n\n‍\n\n4. Include white space\nProper use of white space is crucial to create a visually appealing and easy-to-read resume. White space refers to the areas of the page that are left blank or unoccupied by text or images.\n\nUse resume margins, line spacing, and breaks to create space between different sections. This will help to highlight essential information and make it stand out.\n\n‍\n\n5. Customize your content \nTailoring your resume to the specific job you're applying for can increase your chances of getting noticed by potential employers.\n\nRather than sending out a generic resume, take the time to customize it to the specific job and company. To do this:\n\nCarefully review the job description\nNote the required skills, qualifications, and experiences.\nCustomize your resume by emphasizing these skills and your experiences that align with the job requirements\n‍\n\n6. Keep it concise\nKeeping your resume concise is an important part of standard resume formatting.\n\nWhile providing enough information to showcase your qualifications and experiences is important, a resume that's too long can be overwhelming and challenging to read.\n\nTo keep your resume concise, focus on providing only relevant experience and skills.\n\n‍\n\n7. Proofread carefully\nProofreading your resume is crucial to keeping it error-free and presenting yourself in the best possible light.\n\nTypos, grammatical errors, and formatting issues can make you appear unprofessional and decrease your chances of getting hired.\n\nTo proofread your resume carefully, read it slowly and pay attention to each sentence. Check for spelling and grammar errors, and make sure that the formatting is consistent throughout the document.\n\n‍\n\n8. Use an ATS-friendly resume format\nApplicant tracking systems (ATS) are digital filing systems used by recruiters to organize resumes and during the hiring process.\n\nTo make sure your resume scans correctly into these organizational tools, make sure to use an ATS-friendly resume template that's widely accepted and easily parsed by any modern ATS.\n\n‍\n\n9.

How to Decide (Pros & Cons)\n\nContents\nUnderstanding the two-column resume\nTwo-column resume vs. one-column resume\nHow to create a two-column resume\nTwo-column resume templates\nShould you use a two-column resume?\nCreate the perfect resume format with Teal \nBuild Your Best Resume!\nCreate, improve, and manage your resume in a single dynamic platform.\nSign Up, It's Free\n3 key takeaways\n\nA two-column resume is the less common way to format a resume. \nUsing a two-column resume template may be a better option for some than others.  \nTeal’s AI Resume Builder can help you craft a resume and highlight your achievements.\nIf you’re on the job search, you know how important your resume is to land an interview. You know to include key information about your employment history and skills. But do you know when to use a two-column resume over a traditional single-column resume?\n\nAs the name suggests, two-column resumes are a type of resume design that uses two columns. Oftentimes the two-column format is not applied to the entire design, but used in specific sections, like Skills or Awards, to maximize space when listing several items. This resume layout can be visually appealing, grab attention, and set you apart from other job seekers.\n\nMulti-column resume to land your dream job\nTeal's Resume Builder includes dozens of customizable templates\nUltimately, you want to choose the resume format that makes it easiest for hiring managers to read while avoiding any trouble with Application Tracking Systems (ATS). \n\nIn this article, you’ll learn the differences between one-column and two-column resumes, and what to consider when deciding on the ideal resume format for your job search.\n\nUnderstanding the two-column resume\nA two-column resume layout uses two distinct columns to highlight the most important information about your skills, abilities, and employment history. So instead of a one-column resume that presents everything from top to bottom, a two-column layout is split vertically—though rarely symmetrical—and presents information in a two-column format. \n\nA two-column resume is read from left to right. To emphasize your most important and relevant information, place it in the first place the hiring manager will look: the left column.\n\nEvery layout comes with tradeoffs. Here are benefits and drawbacks of using a two-column resume to consider before committing to a format:\n\nTwo-Column Resume Pros\nEasily scannable. The two-column layout makes your resume easy to skim, which can help relevant information stand out to hiring managers. \nSaves space. Having two columns may help you consolidate space, making it easier to fit your experience on a single-page resume instead of a two-page resume. \nEye-catching. Some two-column resume templates are more creative with appealing design elements, like icons for bullet points and visual skill meters.\nTwo-Column Resume Cons\nLimited white space. If you cram everything into two columns to make it one page, the limited white space will make it crowded and difficult to scan. \nMay not be ATS-friendly. A two-column resume, and design elements that often accompany this format, often have formatting nuances that make it difficult for an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to parse out information, causing errors or even rejection.\nNon-traditional. A single-column resume is the standard. Despite its benefits, two-column resumes are non-traditional. While that’s not a bad thing by itself, some hiring managers or recruiters prefer single-column resumes. \nAs Director of Talent Mike Peditto clarifies, two-column resumes are tricky to get right:\n\n“Most two-column resumes I see either sacrifice good content in favor of nice formatting, or have squeezed long bullet points into a very narrow section so that they turn into paragraphs rather than an easier-to-read one- or two-line bullet.”\nTwo-column resume vs. one-column resume\nIf you’re searching for a new job and updating your resume, you need to decide on the right  column resume format for the job.\n\nBefore committing to a format, compare one column against two column resumes. One-column resumes are more common and a good option if you want a basic resume that outlines your professional experience. \n\nIn contrast, two columns can give you more real estate to list your professional accomplishments on your resume. For those in creative industries—design, writing, film, etc.—a two-column resume can be more visually appealing. Plus, it offers more opportunities to shape your resume layout around your personal brand and creative style.\n\nTeal resume examples for 1 and 2 columns\nAll Teal resume templates are ATS-friendly\nWhether you have a limited employment history or a robust and decades-long work history, a single-column resume is ideal for job seekers who want to keep it brief and to the point. A one-column resume can also be more legible, a benefit to any hiring manager. \n\nA two-column resume is easy to scan and can display more of your experience and professional accomplishments. There are certain instances where a two-column resume format may be preferable:\n\nIf you have extensive experience or technical skills to highlight\nIf the application requires resumes be one page\nIf you’re in a creative field\nIf you opt for a two-column resume, just be aware of the shortcomings. Mike Peditto, director of talent at Teal says:\n\n“Two-column resumes often wind up limiting what you actually write about in your experience [section], which is the most important part of the resume.”\nFor more information on when to use which resume layout, check out our guide on resume formats. \n\nHow to create a two-column resume\nTwo-column resumes may not be standard, but they’re not always bad practice. The key is to  format two-column resumes correctly, so an ATS can properly parse and label the right sections when scanning.\n\nHere’s how to make a two-column resume:\n\n1. Choose a two-column resume template\nYou can research various two-column resume templates and find the one that fits your needs and style in this library of 1,500 resume examples. These samples include resumes for nearly every role, including several two-column examples in the Skills section.\n\n2. Add the basics\nInclude your full name and contact information—phone number, email address, location, and LinkedIn profile—in the header.\n\n3. Include a professional summary\nIn a few sentences, highlight your experience and share what you bring to the table. Be clear on what you’re looking for in your next job role. \n\n4. Fill out the columns\nIf you’re using a two-column resume template, this should be straightforward. For a more design-savvy layout, you can create your own custom columns by making tables that are the same size and split down the middle. Ensure you're including all the necessary resume sections in your two-column resume:\n\nWork history\nEducational achievements\nProfessional accomplishments\nSkills\nResume summary\nTarget title \nContact information\nCertifications\nPro Tip: You can omit certain roles, skills, achievements, or other elements of a section based on the job description in Teal. Or, you can hide an entire section altogether if you'd prefer.\n\n5. Fix any formatting issues.\nMake sure the columns are even (if going for a symmetrical two-column layout) and the font and size are consistent. Consider using headings to break up sections and bullet points. Adjust the margins and line spacing to leave enough white space so it doesn’t read like a wall of text.\n\nTwo-column resume templates\nIf you want to use the two-column resume layout, finding a solid template can be a game-changer. Look for a two-column resume template in a system you can easily use, such as Google Docs or Word. Make sure it’s simple to format and revise and that you feel it reflects who you are as a professional. Try saving it in different forms such as .doc or .pdf to make sure everything converts correctly and looks consistent throughout. \n\nTeal resume templates for 1 and 2 columns\nTeal's resume library includes 1,500+ resume examples\nShould you use a two-column resume?\nA two-column resume layout can be useful if you have a range of professional experience that needs more space to cover. It can also be an attractive option for entry to mid-level job seekers who want to utilize the space in a different way and creatives who want more flexibility. \n\nGenerally speaking, most of the relevant information in a one-column resume is also in a two-column resume format. The primary differences are you may be able to fit more into two columns but it will read differently.\n\nThe page has a vertical split into two columns. While having a two-column resume can be unique and eye-catching, it can also look messy and unprofessional if it’s too crowded or ill formatted.\n\nWhether you choose one or two columns for your resume, make sure there is consistent spacing between the columns, lines and margins. The text should be legible and there should be enough white space for the text to breathe. \n\nInclude keywords in your resume that are based on your experience and the jobs you’re applying to. For more tips on optimizing your resume, check out our resume best practices.\n\nCreate the perfect resume format with Teal \nHaving to decide between a one-column vs two-column resume can feel like a big decision. Here’s the thing—you can also submit both while you’re on the job hunt and see if one layout gets more callbacks.\n\nThough it’s not as commonly used, a two-column resume can help you stand out from the crowd in certain creative industries and present a lot of key information in a compelling way. Your resume should amplify what you do, so whether you choose a one-column resume or multiple columns, make sure it’s “on brand” for who you are and what you do.\n\nTo master the art of the resume, use Teal’s AI-powered Resume Builder which can simplify the not-so-pleasant process of resume formatting, designing, and tailoring for each job description.\n\nSign Up, It's Free\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan a two-column resume be detrimental when applying through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)?\nIs a two-column resume more suitable for certain industries or professions?\nHow can I decide if a two-column resume is the right choice for my job application?","URL Slug":"two-column-resume","Meta Description":"Learn the pros and cons of using a two-column resume with tips."}}]}

You want your resume to accurately represent your experience, skills, and achievements. A resume gives hiring managers an idea of who you are—which may include adding your pronouns to your resume.\nChoosing whether to include your pronouns on your resume is a personal decision. However, it’s one that may allow you to express your identity and ensure the company you work for has solid diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.\nThis guide covers whether you might want to include pronouns on your resume (or not), and if you do, how to add them to your resume and LinkedIn.\nUse Teal’s AI Resume Maker to properly format every detail.\n‍\nUnderstanding pronouns and their importance in identity\nPronouns are words that stand in for nouns to refer to people or things; pronouns, specifically, are the words we use to refer to people in lieu of their name. For example, you may use the pronouns she, her, and hers. That means when people talk about you, they might say something like, “That new engineer is a writer. She’s always loved telling stories.”\nExamples of pronouns include:\nHe/him/his\nShe/her/hers\nThey/them/theirs\nZe/Zir/Zirs\nSome people may choose to use a mix of pronouns, like “she/they” or “they/he.” In this case, you may use multiple types of pronouns to refer to them. For example, if someone used she/they pronouns, you could say, “She’s such a great manager. Did you see how well they presented in the morning meeting?”\nPronouns are one way people express their identity, especially for people whose gender identity may not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. For example, nonbinary job seekers may use gender neutral pronouns like they/them/theirs.\nWhile some people use their pronouns to affirm their gender identity, pronouns don’t always indicate someone’s gender. However, just because someone uses non-gender specific pronouns doesn’t mean they’re nonbinary. It’s important not to assume someone’s gender identity from their pronouns.\nEveryone has the right to choose pronouns they identify with. Using someone’s correct pronouns is a form of respect and recognition, just like using someone’s preferred name and ensuring you spell it correctly.\nIn the workplace, if you see someone shares their preferred pronouns on a resume, in their email signature, their Slack status, their Zoom name, or anywhere else, be sure to use their correct pronouns.\n‍\nShould you include pronouns on your resume?\nWhether or not to include pronouns on your resume is an entirely personal decision. That being said, there are a few benefits—and drawbacks—of including them.\n‍\nReasons for including pronouns on a resume\nAdding your pronouns on your resume might be beneficial for your sense of identity and understanding your future employer.\nPrevents misgendering: Adding your pronouns to your resume can (hopefully!) ensure that there’s no confusion or mistakes from hiring managers on what your pronouns are, ensuring you’re addressed correctly from the start of the hiring process. This helps prevent the use of wrong pronouns, which can lead to uncomfortable situations and the need for corrections.\nPromotes inclusivity: Using pronouns on your resume can promote tolerance and belonging of all identities. No matter your gender identity or pronouns, adding them to your resume can signal you support gender diversity and an inclusive workplace where everyone is respected.\nDemonstrates values & culture-fit: Adding personal pronouns on your resume can provide hiring managers insight into your values and alignment with the company culture.\nWeeds out non-inclusive companies: If hiring managers reject your resume because you’ve included pronouns, they’re likely working for a company you wouldn’t align with anyway!\n‍\nReasons against including pronouns on a resume\nWhile there are so many positive, personal reasons to include pronouns on a resume, including personal pronouns on a resume could lead to potential bias during the hiring process. Whether the employer is conscious of it or not, there may be bias against resumes that include pronouns, especially for resumes of nonbinary people with gender neutral pronouns.\nAccording to a study by business.com, hiring managers offered negative comments about pronouns on a resume 38 percent of the time. While this is a minority of respondents, it does still demonstrate a significant risk of discrimination for those who choose to include their pronouns.\n‍\nShould I include pronouns on my resume?\nIncluding your pronouns on your resume is a way to express your identity, share what pronouns you prefer, and align yourself with diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.\nUnfortunately, in some industries and at some companies, adding pronouns to your resume may be seen as unprofessional and can even lead to your resume being rejected.\nHowever, you should never be discriminated against based on your gender identity—both ethically and legally. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act legally prohibits employers from discrimination based on your sex (including sexual orientation, pregnancy, and gender identity) at work, including when you apply for a job.\nIf a company chooses to pass on your resume because you’ve included pronouns, it’s probably not a company you’d want to work for anyway. The good news is you may have a case to take legal action.\n‍\nHow to put pronouns on a resume\nYou’ve decided you want to include pronouns on your resume—great! Here’s how to make a resume that includes pronouns, including what section they can go in and how to format them. \n‍\nWhere to put pronouns on a resume\nThe correct placement of pronouns on a resume is in your resume header, above your short professional bio or resume personal statement (if you have one). You can either include them right next to your name, or below your name next to your contact information.\nIn Teal’s Resume Builder, you can use header fields to easily and clearly add your pronouns to your resume. \n\n‍\n\n‍\nExamples of how to include pronouns on a resume\nIn these pronouns on resume examples, each person has included their pronouns in their resume header, either next to their name or contact information. You should always include your pronouns upfront in this section. \n‍‍‍\nTeal’s Design Mode feature can ensure you always place and format your pronouns on a resume correctly, easily, and clearly.\n\n‍\n‍\nHow to add pronouns on LinkedIn\nOutside of your resume, you can also opt to add your pronouns to your LinkedIn profile. In 2021, LinkedIn released a pronoun feature that allows you to add your pronouns next to your name. \n‍\n1. Navigate to your profile\nFirst, navigate to your general profile page, where you can make edits to your profile. Select the pencil icon to start to make edits to your intro.\n\n‍\n2. Choose your pronouns\nChoose from LinkedIn’s options of pronouns, or write in your own custom pronouns.\n‍\n\n‍\n3. Choose your pronoun visibility\nYou can choose to share your pronouns only with your LinkedIn connections (1st-degree only) or with all members signed into LinkedIn.\nRegardless of which option you choose, members don’t have the ability to search for you based on your pronouns.‍\nYour pronouns will now appear next to your name on your LinkedIn profile. Your pronouns will also appear on the general LinkedIn feed when you share a comment or post and in messages.\n\n‍\nUsing pronouns in the workplace\nThe use of pronouns in the workplace is not only a practical necessity to communicating with and about others, but can be a step toward a more tolerant, respectful, and welcoming work environment.\nAdditionally, the role of the hiring manager and human resources is crucial in addressing discrimination in the hiring process, as their perception can significantly influence the fairness of applicant evaluations, particularly concerning gender identity and the use of personal pronouns on resumes.\n‍\nWhy are pronouns important in the workplace?\nPronouns are important in the workplace to ensure respectful everyday communication that promotes a culture of belonging.\nThe impact of respecting pronouns on workplace culture is wide-reaching. When you normalize using pronouns in the workplace, you promote a culture where everyone is encouraged to be their authentic selves. Using a person’s correct pronouns in the workplace is a sign of respect.\n‍\nDos and don’ts for using pronouns in the workplace and hiring process\nWhen using personal pronouns in the workplace, focus on creating an inclusive atmosphere, but don’t push anyone to share pronouns if they’re uncomfortable doing so.\nDon’t assume someone’s pronouns: “You want to avoid assuming people's pronouns,” says Dr. Kyle Elliot, tech career coach and job search expert. “While you may be correct most of the time, all it takes is one instance of misgendering in the workplace to negatively impact your colleague's sense of inclusion, belonging, and psychological safety.” Instead, check to see if they’ve shared their pronouns in their email signature, Slack, Zoom, or other workplace tools. If not, you can share your pronouns when speaking with them to encourage them to share their own. \nDo normalize sharing pronouns: If you’re comfortable sharing your personal pronouns, normalize sharing them in your everyday conversations and communications. “One of the greatest ways to use pronouns in the workplace is by example—influencing others by adding your pronouns to your email signatures or Slack profile,” says Vit Koval, global hiring and remote work advocate. \"It normalizes the practice and really does help to create space that is open and inclusive for everyone.”\nDo use the pronouns people share with you: Once someone shares their pronouns with you, ensure you always use the correct ones when referring to them, both in-person and in online communication.\nDon’t force people to share their pronouns: While you want to normalize sharing pronouns, employers should never mandate that people share their pronouns. Mandating pronouns may force some employees to come out before they’re ready or willing to share their pronouns with their coworkers.\nDon’t dwell on mistakes: If you make a mistake and use the incorrect pronouns for someone, drawing too much attention to it can make both you and the other person feel worse. Quickly apologize, correct your mistake, and move on—and make sure you don’t make the same mistake again.\n‍\nPutting pronouns on your resume is a personal decision\nThe choice to include personal pronouns on a resume is ultimately a personal decision, and there’s no right or wrong answer. If you do choose to disclose pronouns, it can ensure other people use your correct pronouns during your job search and interview process, promote inclusivity, and weed out companies that aren't inclusive.\nAdding your pronouns to your resume is as easy as adding them to your header, either next to your name or contact information. You can use Teal’s AI Resume Builder to easily customize and add your pronouns to your resume in minutes.

A professional resume and cover letter are standard, but adding links in your resume can showcase more of your skills and abilities and can complement your other materials. Whether you should include links in resumes is sometimes hotly debated and it depends on the situation and the type of URL.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn:\n\nThe importance of resume links\nWhether you should include links in your resume\nWhich social media links (if any) to include in your resume\nHow to include links in your resume using various tools\nThe best place to put links in your resume\n‍\n\nWant to highlight your work with clickable links? Use Teal's resume maker to add and manage them on your resume—easily.\n\n‍\n\nThe importance of links in a resume\nWhy should you include links in your resume if you already have a cover letter and resume? Links can enhance a resume and add a layer of depth to your application. You can point hiring managers and recruiters in the right direction and show your skills, not just state them. But how important they are for your resume depends on your industry. \n\nFor example, a career portfolio can be used for designers, writers, developers, and other creators. Your portfolio can show your talent in action and boost your credibility. Adding social media links is appropriate for social media and marketing roles. And if you don’t have your own personal website or need to share social media links, include your LinkedIn profile URL. \n\nPutting links in your resume can also give you more control. Let’s face it, potential employers are probably going to Google you and scope out your online presence. By providing the right links, you have a better chance of owning your narrative—well before they go digging. \n\nUsing Teal’s Resume Builder, you can easily add and format your URL (the link address) and turn it into a hyperlink (clickable text going to the link address). Including the raw URL (full website address spelled out, rather than embedded) is beneficial if your resume is printed out, so people know where to go. A hyperlink makes everything one click away if your resume is submitted online.\n\n‍\n\nShould you include links in your resume?\nThere are many dos and don’ts when searching for jobs. One of the age-old questions is should you include links in resumes? The short answer: it depends.\n\nBut this simple follow-up question will help you decide:\n\nWill adding the links help or hurt your chances of scoring an interview? \n\nSome creative and project-based positions get the most out of including links in a resume. A link can house your portfolio or showcase your relevant projects, bringing your skills to life. \n\nLinks to personal social media accounts (outside of LinkedIn) shouldn’t be included in your resume unless you’ve built a following and it relates to the job you want. For example, social media managers or influencers may use links to show proof of their social skills. \n\nIf you’re on the fence about whether to include links in your resume, consider the pros and cons of resume links:\n\n‍\n\nPros\nShow creativity \nDemonstrate skills and abilities\nEstablish expertise and credibility \n‍\n\nCons\nLinks could break\nNot everyone will click \nDesign may be impacted with some Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) or the link may not come through at all\n‍\n\nThe last two cons are key. Even if you have a stunning website and include your portfolio URL, you can’t control what others do. In other words, there’s always the possibility that someone will skim past it and not click on it. Additionally, Applicant Tracking Systems may treat links differently. \n\nDr. Kyle Elliott, tech career coach, CaffeinatedKyle.com says:\n\n“With hundreds of applicant tracking systems (ATS) on the market, you can't know for sure how your resume will be parsed. That said, it's best to avoid hiding any vital information behind a link on your resume. Instead, try to include the text directly on your resume when possible. If you do choose to include a link on your resume, provide the entire link (for example: LinkedIn.com/in/KyleCromerElliott), rather than an abbreviation (for example: \"LinkedIn Profile\"), as many ATS will convert the contents of your document into plain text.\"\nIn addition to including links as raw URLs, Elliot recommends a description to accompany links in a resume:\n\n“Be sure to provide context when providing a link on your resume. If you want to share a project you worked on, for instance, explain your role and impact. When in doubt, assume the link won't get opened, and only the content of your resume will be read by a prospective employer.”\nThink of any resume links you provide as a bonus. A company may have a policy of not clicking on links due to suspected malware or viruses. So even if you put links in your resume, there's no guarantee the hiring manager will open the link, even if they want to.\n\nFor more tips on what to include in your resume, check out our guide on how to list contact information on your resume.\n\n‍\n\nHow to include social media links in your resume\nYour social media accounts can give a glimpse of your personal brand and help the hiring manager get to know you better. At a minimum, job candidates can include their LinkedIn URL, as it’s a career platform. But should you include social media links in resume that aren’t LinkedIn?\n\nIf you’re considering another social media channel, review on a case-by-case basis. For example, if you’re applying for a role where you’ll be creating videos or content, including your TikTok may be relevant.\n\nThe question to always come back to: Is this directly related to the job I’m applying to? \n\nIf it’s not, forget about it. If you decide to move forward with including social media links in your resume, it should be strategic and thoughtful. Here’s how to put links in your resume:\n\n‍\n\n1. Identify relevant social media links\nDo an audit of the social media links you want to include in your resume. Before adding, answer the following questions:\n\nDoes your profile page represent who you are as a job applicant?\nIs the link relevant to the position you’re applying to?\nDo you have a professional headshot—and is it current? \nAre your posts useful?\nIs the content free of any spelling or grammar errors? \nDo you have any content that can be considered insensitive?\n‍\n\nWhen not to include social media links: \n\nIf your photo is unprofessional and more than two years old\nIf your posts are stream-of-consciousness or rambly \nIf the content isn’t related to the role you’re applying for\nIf your posts include potentially offensive takes on hot-button issues \n‍\n\n2. Review URL address \nAfter identifying the social media links you want to include, copy each URL address so you can paste it into your resume. Your LinkedIn profile should be customized to include your full name. You can edit the LinkedIn URL by going to your profile and clicking on the pencil in the upper right “Public profile & URL” section. If the other links are lengthy, consider shortening them using a tool like Bit.ly. \n\n‍\n\n3. Add social media links to resume\nYou can paste the URL address at the top of your resume or near the contact information section.\n\nTeal’s Resume Builder can simplify this process. After importing a resume or your LinkedIn URL, Teal will help you build a resume.\n\nIn the “Contact Information\" section, you’ll see a place to add your LinkedIn or Twitter URL. \n\nPaste the URL address into the appropriate section. \n\n‍\n\nWhere to include relevant links on your resume\nAuto-fill contact information by importing an existing resume or LinkedIn URL to Teal\n‍\n\nIn Teal's AI Resume Builder, you can save all contact info, including various professional links.\n\nHit “Save”\n\n‍\n\nlinkedin url\nIn Teal's AI Resume Builder, you can choose to hide or show certain contact info (including URLs) for specific resume versions\nIn Teal's AI Resume Builder, you can turn any contact info (including URLs) on and off.\n\nMake sure the box is checked to include the link in your resume. \n\nTeal’s Resume builder makes it easy to add links in resume and gives you the tools to match your resume with a job description for a specific role.\n\nCreate a Free Resume with Teal\n‍\n\nHow to include hyperlinks in your resume\nYou can either paste the URL address directly into your resume or make it a hyperlink. Hyperlinks refer to clickable links within text (for example, all of the working links in this article are hyperlinks). Doing this saves resume real estate and directs hiring managers to your materials in one click. Typically, you need to highlight the URL or a string of text, insert the link, and paste the URL. But each platform may vary, so here’s how to include hyperlinks in your resume with various tools. \n\n‍\n\nHow do I add a link to my resume in Word?\nTo add a link to your resume in Word:\n\nCopy the link you want to hyperlink \nHighlight the URL address or text you want to hyperlink\nGo to “Insert”\nGo to “Links”\nClick on “Link”\nPaste the URL address\nhow to add a link to a resume in word\nSelect the link icon in the top menu to add a URL to your Microsoft Word resume template\n‍\n\nHow do I add a link to my resume in Google Docs?\nTo add a link to your resume in Google Docs:\n\nCopy the link you want to hyperlink \nHighlight the URL address or relevant text \nGo to “Insert”\nGo to “Link”\nwhere to add URLs for websites in Google Docs\nType CMD+K on Mac or CTRL+K to add a link to a Google Docs resume template\nPaste URL address \nHit “Apply”\nPro tip: You can also edit a hyperlink after placing it in Google Docs by clicking on the hyperlink and selecting pencil icon.\n\n‍\n\nHow to edit a hyperlink in Google Doc\nSelect the pencil icon to edit a hyperlink in Google Docs\nHow do I add a link to my resume in Canva?\nTo add a link to your resume in Canva:\n\nCopy the link you want to hyperlink \nClick on the design template\nHighlight the URL address or relevant text \nClick the link icon \nHow to add links in resume in Canva\nClick the link icon to add a URL to a resume in Canva\nPaste the link in “Enter a link or search” box\nClick “Done” \n‍\n\nHow do I add a link to my resume in Teal?\nTo add a link to resume in Teal: \n\nCopy the link you want to hyperlink \nLog into your Teal account (or create one for free) \nGo to “Resume Builder”\nImport your existing resume or LinkedIn URL\nUnder “Contact Information” click on “Edit”\nPaste LinkedIn profile, Twitter profile, or website in the designated box\nEasily click to hide or show URLs on your resume\nEasily click to hide or show URLs on your resume using Teal\nChoose when to hide or show URLs on your resume in Teal's AI Resume Builder by checking or unchecking boxes.\n\nPress “Save”\nMake sure the box with the link is checked, so it shows up on resume \nWhile you can add links in your resume using a variety of tools, Teal’s Resume Builder can help you effortlessly format and optimize everything in one place. It can also help you write about your achievements in your bullet points. \n\nPlace professional links in the header of your resume near your contact info and above your work history\nPlace professional links in the header of your resume, near your contact info and above your work history\n‍\n\nWhere to put portfolio and LinkedIn links on your resume\nIf you want the hiring manager to actually click on your portfolio URL or LinkedIn profile, location is key. Depending on the resume design, the links could be at the top or on the side in the contact information section. This can help maximize visibility and boost your chances of having the links clicked.  \n\nplace professional links at the top of your resume\nTeal's AI Resume Builder places your professional links at the top of your resume\n‍\n\nYour portfolio and LinkedIn URL can provide additional information that may not be in your resume or cover letter. While the most important parts should always be in your resume and cover letter, adding other links that demonstrate your skills can add depth to your job application, providing more credibility. That can help differentiate you so you stand out to the hiring manager. \n\nTeal’s Resume Formatting feature can help simplify the process. You can put your website and LinkedIn profile in the “Contact Information” section. From there, you can choose a template design that fits your needs.\n\n‍\n\nCan an ATS read hyperlinks?\nApplicant tracking systems, or ATS, are used by hiring managers and recruiters to track applicants. Many employers use ATS to easily vet candidates for required skills and streamline the hiring process. \n\nThere are different applicant tracking systems. Many of the sophisticated ones used today can read hyperlinks. Other antiquated systems may not be able to read a hyperlink. In some cases, your link may be garbled into a mix of characters.\n\nWhile this seems to be somewhat uncommon, there’s little benefit to leaving it to chance. Mike Peditto, director of recruiting at Teal, recommends including the full URL just in case:\n\n“I’ve never heard of a hyperlink disrupting an ATS, but sometimes the link doesn’t come through. The advice I’d offer is to write out the actual web address rather than ‘LinkedIn’ [anchor text] so if the link doesn’t parse, people can still copy and paste the URL.”\nThat’s why it’s always a good idea to spell out the URL address and hyperlink it. If the hyperlinked text isn’t read by the ATS or the resume is printed, the needed information is still there to type the address in manually. Teal’s Resume Formatting Feature places your links at the top with the URL address, making it ATS-friendly.\n\n‍\n\nBest practices for adding links\nWhether you add hyperlinks in your resume or not is a personal decision. It should only be done if it adds value. The links should help you score an interview, not take you out of the running. \n\nBefore putting links in your resume, double-check the link. A simple copy-and-paste error can lead to a broken link and defeat the purpose entirely.

That's scary by itself (hello rejection!). If you have a disability, that fear can compound.\n\"Should I say I have a disability on job applications?\" is a common career question among the 28.7% of adults in the US who have a disability. Deciding whether to disclose your disability status is deeply personal and there’s no one-size-fits-all answer.\nBut there are nuances to consider before submitting your job application or accepting a job. On one hand, it can help your employer understand you better and ensure you get reasonable accommodations. On the other hand, unconscious bias and discrimination exist, even though it’s illegal. Read on to learn more about disabilities in the workplace and how to navigate whether to disclose a disability or not. \nStruggling to land a job interview with your resume? Try Teal’s free resume builder.\n‍\nUnderstanding disabilities in the workplace\nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which makes it illegal to discriminate against qualified individuals who have a disability. The ADA ensures equal employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. This applies to private companies with 15 employees or more and state and local government employers.\n‍\nWhat is considered a disability on a job application?\nWhile the term “disability” can mean a lot of things, the ADA “defines an individual with a disability as a person who:\nHas a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity\nHas a record or history of a substantially limiting impairment\nIs regarded or perceived by an employer as having a substantially limiting impairment\nDisabilities can vary. The CDC shares some different types of disabilities, which can affect:\nCognition\nMobility\nIndependent living\nHearing\nVision\nSelf-care\nA visible disability might be more recognizable if someone uses a wheelchair or has a white cane from being visually impaired. However, many so-called invisible disabilities are classified under the ADA as well. What is considered a disability on a job application may surprise you. \nFor example, ADHD qualifies as do other common mental disorders including anxiety, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and depression. In fact, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the top causes of disability worldwide. \nSo you may have a condition under the ADA that’s classified as a disability, whether you identify with the label or not. Under the ADA, you have the choice of whether you disclose your disability or not.\n‍\nAre you required to self-identify as disabled on an application?\nYour prospective employer may ask you to fill out the Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability form. At your discretion, you have three options you can check:\nYes, I have a disability, or have had one in the past \nNo, I do not have a disability and have not had one in the past \nI do not want to answer\nThe point of having you fill this out is twofold. One, if you mark yes, your employer is responsible for providing reasonable accommodations. Additionally, your employer must be an equal opportunity employer and this form can help track applicants with disabilities.\nThe form states, “Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.”\n‍\nShould you disclose a disability on a job application?\nIf you have a disability or see your condition listed on the voluntary form, the question is: should I say I have a disability on a job application? Dannie Lynn Fountain, HR program manager at Google says:\n“Disclosing is a personal calculus based on risk and need. It may vary by company, may vary by individual as well.”\nFor example, if you are applying for a position as a senior art director, disclosing a visual impairment might have particular implications depending on the company's culture and the specific requirements of the role.\nSo whether or not you should disclose a disability on a job application depends on your situation. First of all, you’re not legally required to disclose a disability. Secondly, if you don’t need any special accommodations it’s probably a moot point.\nVit Koval, global hiring and remote work advocate at Globy states: \n“In some cases, it may even be practical not to disclose at all, especially in the case of your disability not affecting the performance of the job or probably if you are not quite sure about the company's policies on inclusivity.”\n‍\nPros and cons of disclosing a disability\nThe application process is hard enough without worrying about the potential prejudices against those with disabilities. Everyone’s circumstances are different, so it’s key to evaluate the pros and cons of disclosing a disability.\nPro tip: Using a company research database can be crucial to understand a company's inclusivity policies before deciding to disclose a disability.\n‍\nWhat are the benefits of disclosing a disability to an employer?\nThe benefits of disclosing a disability to an employer include:\nYou are your authentic self and don’t need to worry about being “found out” when truthfully identifying\nYou can receive special accommodations as needed\nYou may find community or become a leading voice in your organization\nYour employer may have a better understanding of what conditions you work best in\nYou have legal protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act\nUsing a company research database, AI can help identify inclusive employers who value diversity and provide equal employment opportunities.\nThough this isn’t a benefit for you, in some cases, your employer could be eligible for tax incentives by hiring someone with a disability.\n‍\nWhat are the disadvantages of disclosing a disability to an employer?\nEveryone craves acceptance and the feeling of belonging. Having a disability, whether it’s visible or not, can make you feel “different.” Worse, people may treat you differently.\nHere are some disadvantages of disclosing a disability to an employer. \nYou might face discrimination and/or bias and your employer may potentially fire you\nYou may be treated as the “token disabled person”\nYour employer may not provide any or sufficient accommodations\nYou may be overlooked during all the hiring stages, or for promotions \nYou may be treated differently due to a lack of understanding  \nAccording to Koval, disclosing a disability is not without risk:\n“There's always a risk unconscious bias could influence the hiring process, and that's of major concern, especially in nascent industries or parts of the world where awareness and inclusivity are still maturing.\"\n‍\nWhen to disclose a disability in your job search and interview process\nFiguring out the answer to “Should I disclose a disability on a job application?” isn’t something to take lightly. But if you decide it’s in your best interest and want to disclose, the next question is when is the best time to do so? Consult these recommendations for every major stage of the hiring process:\n‍\nShould you disclose a disability on your resume?\nThe goal of submitting a resume is to get an interview. You shouldn’t disclose a disability on your resume. Instead, use Teal's resume checker to grade your resume and get guidance on how to improve it to increase your application success rate.\n\n‍\n‍\nShould you disclose a disability on your cover letter?\nSimilar to your resume, the goal of your cover letter is to move to the next stage. Disclosing a disability on your cover letter isn’t the right time or place.\n‍\nShould you disclose a disability on your job application?\nIf you’re given the “Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability” form, you might consider answering “yes” but only if you absolutely require special accommodations. As some others have suggested, you may put you don’t want to answer and if you move forward, you can discuss it in an interview or after getting hired.\n‍\nShould you disclose a disability during the interview process?\nDiscussing something as sensitive and personal as a disability should be done face-to-face. So many conversations go over better that way. You could disclose your disability during the interview process. However, with ADA protections, it might be best to disclose after a job offer.\nKoval recommends disclosing a disability after receiving an offer:\n“If you do decide to share, though, the best time might be after you've received a job offer—or at least during the interview stage, when you can speak about your requirements in a bit more granular detail.”\n‍\nHow to disclose a disability\nOnce you’ve decided when to disclose a disability, you still have to figure out how to do it, which can cause emotional turmoil. You might decide to do it in the job interview or ideally, after you get hired. \nWhile it's also the most intimidating option, sharing in person is typically the best as you can have a conversation. If you want, you can also disclose via email. This may be easier to manage and you’ll have everything in writing. Even if you mention it in person, it’s a good idea to follow up with written communication for your records. \nWhile writing the body of your letter, here's some topics that you may choose to discuss:\nIdentify yourself as a person with a disability\nState that you are requesting accommodations under the ADA (or the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 if you are a federal employee)\nIdentify your specific problematic job tasks\nIdentify your accommodation ideas\nRequest your employer's accommodation ideas\nRefer to attached medical documentation if appropriate*\nAsk that your employer respond to your request in a reasonable amount of time\n‍\nThe Job Accommodation Network (JAN), a resource for disability employment issues provides the following Sample Accommodation Request Letter:\nCc: appropriate individuals\n\nDate of Letter\n\nYour name\nYour address\n\nEmployer's name\nEmployer's address\n\nDear (e.g., Supervisor, Manager, Human Resources, Personnel):\n‍\nBody of letter\n\nSincerely,\nYour signature\nYour printed name\n‍\nUsing this template can provide a framework for getting started. Koval says:\n“Do be specific, when disclosing, about what accommodation you would need ... you don't have to go into too much detail about your condition. The aim is to ensure the employer is clear as to their support for you doing your job.”\nTo help you land a new job, use Teal’s Resume Builder and the resume formatting feature to make a resume as unique as you.\n‍\nDisability on a job application examples\nIf you don’t need special accommodations to perform your job duties, checking “No” or “I do not want to answer” might be your best option. But every situation is unique. Whether you decide to disclose a disability can depend on the type of disability, the job you’re applying to, or the employer.\n‍\nDisclosing a disability on a job application example #1\nLet’s say you have one of the top disabilities in the world, Major Depressive Disorder. You’re not currently having symptoms and it’s being managed well. You say “no” to the disability question on the form and don’t initially disclose it. \nYou get the job and down the line, your symptoms start to creep back up again leading to lost productivity. It starts impacting your work, as you call out more and it’s harder to accomplish your job responsibilities. Your boss might start to see your performance suffer and think you’re not the right fit for the job. In this case, mentioning your condition to your employer could be genuinely helpful. \n‍\nDisclosing a disability on a job application example #2\nYou have celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that damages your small intestines when you ingest gluten. You are on a gluten-free diet to manage. Since you can choose what you eat, there’s no need to disclose it to your employer. \nMany people on a Celiac forum state that if you're not collecting disability benefits, then celiac disease shouldn’t be marked as a disability on the job application. However, depending on the type of job, it may make sense to disclose.\n\n‍\nDisclosing a disability on a job application example #3\nAutism is one of the conditions listed on the voluntary disclosure form. Some commenters on Reddit have different thoughts on how to proceed about whether to voluntarily disclose disabilities or not. One person shared that when they put “prefer not to answer,” they got more calls than when selecting “yes.” \n‍\nAnother person says since they don’t need accommodations, they choose not to disclose. \n‍\nYet another commenter had a different perspective, wanting an inclusive employer who respects their identity at all stages.\n‍\nDisability on a job application example #4\nThe very nature of disabilities is that they are disabling. Depending on your condition, you may have been out of the workforce collecting disability benefits and/or receiving treatment. If your disability led to a lengthy gap in your resume, it might make sense to disclose a disability.\nYou might choose to select “I do not want to answer” and if your resume gap comes up in the interview, you can say you were dealing with a health matter and include what you feel comfortable sharing. \nIf you want to keep it vague, you can simply say you were dealing with personal matters, which is an umbrella term for a range of things. This can help explain why you were out of the workforce for a period of time. \n‍\nDisability on a job application example #5\nDoes saying you have a disability on a job application help? In some cases, it might. For example, if you’re applying for a role at an organization that serves the community you’re a part of, it may help. \nYou have celiac disease and you apply for a job with the Celiac Disease Foundation \nYou have cerebral palsy and you apply for a job with the Cerebral Palsy Foundation \nYou have a mental disorder and apply to be a group facilitator of a support group for others with the same condition\nYou have multiple sclerosis and apply for a job with National Multiple Sclerosis Society\nYou have lupus and apply for a job at the Lupus Foundation of America\nIn these specific cases, your personal experience can be helpful to the mission of the organization. You have first-hand knowledge of what it’s like living with a disability and can provide a level of empathy most others can’t provide. \n‍\nDisability on a job application example #6\nUnfortunately, discrimination still exists and there is a stigma related to certain conditions. Though that might be true for everyone, it can hit even harder if you’re applying for certain positions. For example, if you’re in public-facing roles such as:\nPolice officer \nDoctor\nNurse\nLawyer\nGovernment worker \nIf you have a physical disability, it may be best to disclose it to your potential employer. If you have an invisible disability or chronic condition, you may be fearful of disclosing anything. But these roles tend to have longer vetting procedures and you want to be honest. For example, police officers have a psychological evaluation and a physical assessment. \nBut if you don’t need special accommodations and it won’t impact your ability to do your job, saying “No” or “I do not want to answer” may be best.\n‍\nMake the job search easier with Teal\nShould I put that I have a disability on an application or not? The answer is up to you. In general, if you don’t have to disclose, then don’t. But if you need a special accommodation to do the essential functions of the job, then sharing your disability status is extremely helpful so you get your needs met. \nGet started with Teal’s Resume Builder and Job Tracker to help you in the job application process.

Used interchangeably, chronological and reverse chronological arrange your work history starting with your most recent job and moving backward to highlight your career progression.\n\nWhat’s the right structure for a reverse chronological resume?\nA reverse chronological resume typically includes:\n\nContact information: Your name, phone number, email, and professional profile links, like LinkedIn.\nProfessional summary: A brief highlight reel of your career and key skills.\nWork experience: Your roles with job title, listed from most recent to oldest, focusing on achievements in each position.\nEducation: Academic qualifications, also in reverse chronological order.\nSkills: The most relevant skills to the job you’re targeting, prioritizing hard skills where possible.\nEach section should build upon the others to create a comprehensive picture of your professional identity. \n\nThe goal is to weave your individual experiences into a narrative that showcases not just where you've been but where you're capable of going. Tailor your resume to the job you're targeting, ensuring that it highlights the experiences and skills most relevant to the position.\n\nFeeling overwhelmed? Consider leveraging Teal’s Resume Builder to drag and drop sections around as needed for each application requirement.\n\nCreate a Free Resume with Teal\n‍\n\nBenefits of a reverse chronological resume\nThere are several pros to using a reverse chronological resume. A reverse chronological order resume:\n\nHighlights career progression\nA reverse chronological resume vividly illustrates your professional growth, showcasing your career trajectory from junior roles to more advanced positions. \n\nFor example, it can effectively display a progression from junior to senior analysts, highlighting the expansion of responsibilities and skills over time.\n\nPuts recent experience front and center\nThis format ensures your most recent job, typically the most relevant to your current job search, is showcased prominently. For instance, if your latest role involved project management, this will be immediately evident.\n\nFamiliar to recruiters\nBeing a widely recognized format, it simplifies the review process for the hiring manager. \n\nRecruiters accustomed to this format can quickly identify key elements of your career path, such as job titles, companies, and tenure durations, making it easier to assess your suitability.\n\nDemonstrates stability\nThe reverse chronological resume can highlight consistent employment and upward career movement, qualities highly valued by employers. For instance, you can demonstrate a steady climb within a single company or industry—whether it was a corporate ladder or not— indicating loyalty and commitment.\n\nAligns with contemporary hiring practices\nStarting with your most recent job, the reverse chronological resume aligns seamlessly with modern hiring practices, emphasizing current skills and experiences. This format is particularly effective for those with a straightforward career path in a specific field or industry.\n\nSelecting the right resume format is a pivotal step in your job search. The reverse chronological resume, a popular choice, can be particularly effective under the right circumstances.\n\n‍\n\nDeciding when to use a reverse chronological resume\nThe reverse chronological resume format is most effective for those with a clear and steady progression in their career, particularly within the same field. \n\nThis format is your go-to choice if your recent job experiences align closely with your target position. It allows you to present a consistent employment record, emphasizing your career stability and upward trajectory.\n\nContrasting functional with combination resumes\nIn contrast to functional resume templates, which focus on relevant skills irrespective of where and when they were acquired, reverse chronological resumes spotlight your work journey. This format differs from combination resumes, which merge skills and experience. \n\nOpt for the reverse chronological format if you have a strong work history with minimal gaps and your recent roles are pertinent to your current job aspirations.\n\nStill can't decide which to use? Read this functional vs chronological resume guide for more insight on which one to use when.\n\nWhen to use a reverse chronological resume\nThis resume format excels in various situations:\n\nConsistent work history: Ideal for showcasing a steady employment history in the same field, highlighting your commitment and depth of experience.\nCareer advancement: If you’ve climbed the ladder in a particular sector, this format demonstrates your professional growth.\nTraditional fields: Sectors like finance and law often favor this conventional format.\nRecent graduates: Highlight internships or roles during your studies, especially if they are the most relevant to your job hunt.\nHowever, a functional or combination resume might be more suitable if you're shifting careers, have significant employment gaps, or your most relevant experiences are not recent. \n\nThese formats provide the flexibility to emphasize skills and experiences most relevant to your targeted job.\n\n‍\n\nHow to write a reverse chronological order resume\nHere, you’ll learn how to write a reverse chronological resume:\n\n1) Contact information\nBegin with the basics: your name, phone number, email, and LinkedIn profile. This information should be at the top, making it straightforward for potential employers to contact you.\n\nKeep it simple and professional. That old email address from high school, “xtremeboard7@aol.com,” won’t cut it here (rad as it is). \n\n2) Target title\nJust below your contact details, specify the job title you're aiming for. This sets a clear direction for your application and shows focus.\n\nBe sure to tailor this title to each job application, reflecting the specific role you're pursuing.\n\n3) Professional summary\nCraft a resume summary that showcases your career highlights and key skills. This is your opportunity to shine and make a strong first impression, so highlight what sets you apart and how your skills align with the job you're applying for.\n\nTry to underscore your unique strengths and how they meet the job requirements. Be engaging and concise.\n\n4) Work experience\nList your work history in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent job. Focus on achievements and responsibilities that resonate with the role you’re targeting. \n\nUse bullet points for clarity and provide quantifiable evidence of your impact where possible. \n\n5) Education\nDetail your educational background, leading with your highest degree and spotlighting relevant coursework. This section should demonstrate your academic foundation and how it supports your career goals.\n\n6) Certifications\nInclude any certifications that are relevant to the industry and job you’re applying for. These can add weight to your qualifications and show your commitment to professional development.\n\n7) Skills\nTailor this section to the job description. Highlight both hard and soft skills that are pertinent to the role, demonstrating how your abilities align with the position's needs.\n\n8) Optional sections\nIf applicable, add sections like projects, awards, volunteer work, or publications. These can provide a fuller picture of your capabilities and interests, distinguishing you as a well-rounded candidate.\n\n\nEffective formatting for a reverse chronological resume\nFormatting is crucial in crafting a resume that communicates your qualifications and catches the eye. \n\nConsistency and visual appeal are key:\n\nFont: Choose a professional font and use it consistently throughout your resume.\nColor: Opt for a dark, legible primary color like black for the main text, using subtle highlights (bold, italics, etc) for headings or your name to add visual interest and show hierarchy.\nMargins: Maintain standard margins to give your resume a balanced, clean look.\nDate formatting: Keep date formatting uniform across all sections to ensure cohesiveness.\nTeal’s advanced formatting capabilities help you create a resume that stands out in both content and design. With Teal, you can:\n\nAdjust layouts: Tailor the layout to ensure it best showcases your information, be it your work history, skills, or bullet points.\nDesign elements: Select from a range of design elements to give your resume a distinctive and professional visual appeal.\nPreview and edit: Benefit from the ability to instantly preview how your edits will appear in the final document, allowing for real-time adjustments and improvements.\nTeal's AI Resume Builder offers a range of customization options, including various reverse-chronological resume templates, making your resume not only professional but also reflective of your unique career path.\n\nSign Up, It's Free\nReverse chronological resume examples\nProject manager resume\nThis example of a chronological resume for a Project Manager effectively incorporates several key elements highlighted in the blog post, making it a strong representation of the reverse chronological format.\n\nProject Manager Chronological resume format\nExplore 17+ project manager resume examples for inspiration\nHere's why this resume example stands out:\n\nHighlights career progression: The resume showcases the candidate's career growth, starting from an assistant project manager and evolving into a senior project manager role. \nPuts recent experience front and center: The candidate's most recent and relevant role as a senior project manager at Tech Solutions Inc. is listed first. \nDemonstrates stability: The resume reflects a steady climb within the project management field, indicating the candidate's loyalty and commitment. \nTailored to the job: The resume is customized to reflect the project management role, with a professional summary and skills section that aligns with the position's specific requirements.\nClear and structured layout: The resume's format, with its clear headings and bullet points for easy readability, follows the blog post's guidance on maintaining clarity and structure. \nUse of quantifiable achievements: In the work experience section, bullet points are quantified (e.g., \"completing it ahead of schedule and 10% under budget\").\nBy incorporating these elements, the resume presents a compelling and cohesive narrative of the candidate's professional journey, making it an excellent example of a reverse chronological resume.\n\nEntry Level resume\nentry level chronological resume\nBrowse entry-level resume examples for graduates and first-time job seekers\nThis example of a reverse chronological resume for a recent graduate is effective for several reasons:\n\nFocus on education and relevant coursework: For a new graduate, academic achievements are crucial.

Write a brief yet powerful summary that encapsulates your career achievements and skills that are pertinent to the role you're targeting. This section should act as a personal pitch, setting the tone for the rest of your resume.\n\nEmphasize achievements over routine responsibilities\nWhen detailing your professional history, focus on significant achievements rather than day-to-day tasks. Incorporate quantifiable data, such as percentages or financial metrics, to substantiate your accomplishments, making them more tangible and impactful to the reader.\n\nTailor each application\nCustomize your resume for each job application. This means integrating keywords from the job description to effectively pass through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and align your skills and experiences with the specific requirements of the role.\n\nRemember conciseness and clarity\nAim to keep your resume concise, ideally within a single page. This doesn't mean omitting important information, but rather being selective and succinct in what you choose to include.\n\nProofread (then do it again)\nAvoid spelling or grammatical errors, as they can significantly detract from your qualification. Carefully proofread your resume multiple times, or consider using a grammar-checking tool to ensure accuracy.\n\n‍\n\nWrite your reverse chronological resume with Teal\nYour resume is more than a document; it's a narrative of your professional journey, showcasing your career progression and potential.\n\nThe reverse chronological format effectively tells this story, but personalizing it to your unique experiences and goals is key.\n\nTeal's Resume Builder is a helpful tool for this process. \n\nIt's designed to help you create a resume that resonates with your individuality and aligns with your career aspirations.

You've even triple-checked for typos and grammar. But you're still hearing crickets when sending off resumes.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nOften, decisions to keep you in the candidate pool can come down to small differentiators in resume layout. Seemingly menial formatting issues can sabotage your resume's chances of passing an initial glance or scan.\n\nThis guide walks through critical components of resume spacing, and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nStruggling to land interviews with your resume? Get started with Teal’s AI Resume Builder today.\n\n‍\n\nWhat is resume spacing?\nAt its core, resume spacing refers to the distribution of text and white space on your resume. As a general category, most people are familiar with the term \"resume spacing.\"\n\nBut when you break the concept down further, spacing has several elements you should be familiar with, including:\n\nKerning\nTracking\nLeading\nSpacing\nMargins\nHere's a closer look at each of those terms:\n\n‍\n\nKerning\nKerning refers to the spacing between individual characters in a word. This process is used mainly in typography to achieve visually pleasing spacing between individual letters.\n\nFor example, some letter combinations (like 'VA' or 'WA') may seem to have too much space when the spacing is set uniformly, so you adjust the kerning to bring them closer together.\n\n‍\n\nTracking\nTracking is similar to kerning but deals with the space between groups of letters rather than individual letters. A typographer adjusts tracking to avoid overly tight or crowded text or to fill a line of text to make it flush on each side.\n\n‍\n\nLeading\nLeading is the spacing between lines of text.\n\nThe term comes from the lead strips that were used in manual typesetting to increase the spacing between lines of text. In most digital fonts, leading is an important variable to control for good readability.\n\n‍\n\nSpacing\nSpacing, in a broader sense, refers to the distribution of text (and objects) in a given area, which can involve kerning, tracking, and leading.\n\nBut when used more specifically, it refers to the space between words.\n\nLike kerning or leading, word spacing can greatly affect readability. Too much space might cause the text to appear sparse or disjointed, while too little space may make it look crushed or overwhelmed.\n\n‍\n\nMargins\nMargins are the empty spaces between the edge of the paper (or page) and the main body of the text.\n\nThey frame the body of the text, providing a visual rest and preventing the feeling that the text is falling off the edge of the page. Note-taking, making marks, or scribbling are other margin uses that improve the reading experience.\n\nEach element plays a vital role in creating an aesthetically pleasing, easy-to-read resume layout, whether on a printed page or a digital screen.\n\nFix Your Resume Formatting For Free\n‍\n\nBest resume line spacing by type\nIn the world of resumes, the devil is in the details. And these details contribute to the readability and professional appearance of your resume.\n\nresume spacing and line spacing in Teal\nStandardize text size to create better hierarchy across your resume with Teal\nAmong these, spacing in various forms plays a critical role.\n\n‍\n\n1. Kerning\nKerning adjusts the space between specific letter pairs to reduce awkward gaps and improve typographic appearance.\n\nFor example, you’ll notice that the kerning is wider in the example below on the right-hand side (highlighted) than it is on the left:\n\nkerning example\nKerning is the spacing between letters\nToo much kerning can make the text look awkward, but not enough can damage readability. It’s importance to strike the balance between the two. \n\nRecommendation: For most word processing programs and resume builders, kerning is automatically adjusted at default settings. However, in graphic design software or advanced typography settings, consider manually adjusting kerning for large headers or names to improve aesthetics.\n\nAim for visually consistent spacing between characters, keeping readability in mind.\n\n‍\n\n2. Tracking\nTracking adjusts the overall letter spacing across words, sentences, or paragraphs. This can affect the text density on your resume and its overall readability.\n\nTeal gives you the ability to customize spacing across your sections, paragraphs, and even titles: \n\nparagraph spacing and other section spacing\nDefine specific spacing for every scenario on your resume with Teal's Design Mode 2.0\nRecommendation: Use tracking adjustments sparingly.\n\nFor body text, the default setting typically suffices. For titles or headers, slightly increasing tracking can enhance readability and visual appeal. Make sure the change is subtle and does not disrupt the flow of reading.\n\n‍\n\n3. Leading\nLeading directly correlates with line spacing but specifically refers to the vertical distance between baselines of text. It’s crucial in maintaining the text’s readability and aesthetic spacing.\n\nRecommendation: A good practice is to set leading at 120% to 145% of the font size.\n\nThis proportion ensures lines have enough space to breathe, contributing to an approachable and clear reading experience while maintaining a reasonable resume length.\n\n‍\n\n4. Line Spacing\nLine spacing, or leading, impacts the readability of your resume significantly.\n\nAdequate space between lines ensures the content doesn't appear crammed and allows for a comfortable reading experience for hiring managers.\n\nRecommendation: The standard line spacing for resumes is between 120% and 150%.\n\nline spacing resume\nSet separate line height and list line height in Teal\nThis range provides a balanced look, improving readability while keeping the resume concise. For tighter formats, a minimum of 1.15 is advised.\n\nTo add more breathing room around text, especially for longer sections, 1.5 spacing is optimal.\n\n‍\n\n5. Margin Spacing\nMargins frame the content of your resume, contributing to its overall presentation and efficacy.\n\nToo narrow margins can make a resume look cluttered, whereas too wide may signal a lack of sufficient content.\n\nRecommendation: A safe standard for resume margins is 1 inch on all sides.\n\nmargin spacing resume\nSet separate vertical and horizontal resume margins in Teal\nThis provides enough white space for a clean layout while offering flexibility for trimming by printers. For resumes heavy with ample work experience, a minimum of 0.7 inches might work, but staying within the 1-inch standard is preferable when possible.\n\n‍\n\nSpacing tips by section\nResume spacing isn't one-size-fits-all. The ideal spacing differs across sections.\n\nHere are four tips for nailing the spacing in each part of your resume:\n\n‍\n\n1. Contact info\nContact information on a resume is dense by nature. But that doesn't give you a pass on spacing fundamentals.\n\nUse line breaks, like bullet points, between elements like name, email, phone number, city\nWatch line height if stacking multiple lines of info\nAdd whitespace between contact info and next section\nKeep to one line if possible\ncontact information in resume header\nSet up proper spacing between contact details in youru resume header with Teal\nAppropriately applying space here can eliminate confusion and enhance readability, ensuring your contact details are perceived accurately and quickly.\n\n‍\n\n2. Resume headers\nWhether you choose \"Experience\" or \"Professional History\", resume headers divide your document into clear, scannable sections.\n\nMirror spacing above and below headers\nBe consistent with spacing between headers\nUse capitalization, bolding, or size to differentiate from body text\nGet Flexible Resume Formatting with Teal\nEffective spacing helps visually separate these sections, improving the document's flow and readability.\n\n‍\n\n3. Bullet points\nBullet points are typically where you showcase your past accomplishments, so they really matter. Here's where custom spacing settings come in handy.\n\nMind the margins so bullet points don't extend too far in\nUse 0.5 line height between bullet points for clean spacing\nAlign indent and bullet symbols\nWhen you use a platform like Teal, your bullet points will be automatically spaced for you, but you can also change spacing setting or use stylized bullet points (in Teal+) if you prefer.\n\nbullet points on resume\nTeal's Resume Builder lets users set bullet point spacing separately from other line spacing\nProper spacing can clarify and emphasize your key accomplishments, portraying your skills and experiences in an organized manner.\n\nYou want your accomplishments to be easy to scan and visually digestible.\n\n‍\n\n4. Dates\nPay special attention to spacing around the dates on your resume so they don't blend into other text.\n\nAdd space between job title and date range\nPut dates on their own line with 0.5 spacing above and below\nUse a consistent date format for better alignment\nWith Teal, you not only have the ability to change the spacing around dates, but also the formatting.\n\nTry Design Mode for Free\nCorrect spacing around dates can prevent your timeline from getting lost in the shuffle, making it easier for employers to understand your career progression.\n\n‍\n\nHow to perfect resume spacing strategies\n1. Optimize line height for readability\nAdjust your line height to be between 120 and 145%.\n\nWhy it matters: This range prevents your text from appearing too cramped or excessively spaced, maintaining optimal readability.\n\nExample: For a document in a 12-point font size, setting your line height to approximately 120 to 140% ensures that your content is easily digestible.\n\nNote: Font sizes are important, but so is the font you use. Read this to learn which font to use on your resume.\n\n‍\n\n2. Strategically space resume elements\nImplement a 0.5x multiplier of your baseline height for spacing between distinct resume elements, such as job titles, organizations, and dates.\n\nWhy it matters: This technique creates a visually organized structure, making it easier for hiring managers to navigate your bullet points and professional timeline.\n\nExample: With a 130% line height, the spacing between elements should be around 0.65 lines, striking the perfect balance between separation and cohesion.\n\n‍\n\n3. Adjust margins to frame your content\nSet your resume margins to a range of 0.5 to 1 inch to cushion your content.\n\nWhy it matters: Properly set margins offer enough white space to ensure your resume doesn't look cluttered or overly stretched, contributing to a polished and professional layout. Shorter lines are also easier for a hiring manager to read and scan.\n\nExample: Experiment with top and bottom margins by adjusting them slightly to accommodate section headers without sacrificing the document's balance.\n\n‍\n\n4. Use Line Breaks to Avoid Crowding\nInsert additional line breaks between sections or elements if adjusting line-height doesn't resolve spacing issues.\n\nWhy it matters: Extra line breaks can alleviate visual density, making your resume more approachable and easier to scan for key information.\n\nExample: If a section feels too dense, adding a single line break before and after can enhance clarity and visual appeal, guiding the reader's eye through your document smoothly.\n\nImplementing these spacing strategies will not only elevate the aesthetics of your resume but also enhance its readability, ensuring your professional narrative is communicated effectively. \n\nRemember, a well-spaced resume is more than just visually pleasing—it's critical to showcasing your attention to detail and organizational skills.\n\n‍\n\nSpecial spacing considerations (exceptions and pro tips)\nWhen crafting a resume, understanding the nuanced elements of its design, such as the choice between single, 1.15, and double spacing, can significantly impact its readability and professional appearance.\n\n‍\n\nSingle spacing vs 1.15 spacing vs double spacing\nSingle spacing is the go-to for most of the resume's body text, offering a compact and readable format that fits more content into limited space.\n\nIt's especially effective for detailed sections like experience and education.\n\n1.15 spacing introduces a slightly airier feel to the document without substantially increasing its length.\n\nIt's an excellent middle ground for enhancing readability, particularly for longer paragraphs under each job description or bullet point.\n\nDouble spacing, while not typically used within sections, can delineate clear separations between distinct resume parts like headers, summaries, and primary sections (Experience, Education, Skills).\n\nDouble spaces act as a visual pause, guiding the reader through the document's structure without the overuse of lines or other graphical separators.\n\n‍\n\nProper resume spacing for ATS\nNavigating Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) has become a critical aspect of the job application process. Your resume's spacing affects human readability and how ATS software scans and interprets your information.\n\nATS-friendly spacing: To ensure ATS compatibility, stick to the standard line and margin spacings—such as single or 1.15 line spacing for the body and double spacing for section breaks. This approach helps prevent text from appearing cluttered or overlapping, which could hinder the ability of an ATS to parse the document correctly.\nAvoid complications: Steer clear of using tables, excessive graphics, and column formatting, which ATS systems may struggle to navigate. While these elements might enhance visual appeal for human eyes, they can disrupt an ATS text extraction process, risking the omission of critical information from your resume.\nSpacing in resume design plays a critical role in both aesthetic presentation and functional accessibility.\n\n‍\n\nResume spacing tools & resources\n1.

Get started with Teal’s AI Resume Builder and build a resume that gets it right—for free.\n‍\nWhat are resume qualifications?\nResume qualifications are the job skills, experiences, formal education, and other credentials that demonstrate your ability to perform a particular job. They prove to employers that you possess the necessary qualifications for the role.\nQualifications are typically listed in a dedicated section on your resume, often near the top, to quickly showcase your relevant expertise.\nThis section allows recruiters and hiring managers to easily identify if you meet the basic requirements for the position before diving deeper into your work history and other details.\n‍\nAre resume qualifications still important?\nHighlighting your qualifications helps you stand out from other candidates and increases your chances of getting selected for an interview.\nA well-crafted qualifications section can grab their attention and demonstrate your fit for the role right from the start.\nQualifications are especially vital when an applicant tracking system (ATS) is used to screen resumes. These software programs are commonplace at large companies and scan for relevant keywords related to the job requirements.\nOverall, the qualifications section provides a succinct snapshot of your most relevant skills and experiences tailored to the specific job.\n‍\nTypes of resume qualifications\nThere are several types of qualifications that should be highlighted on a resume. The main categories include:\nSoft and hard skills\nExperience\nEducation\nAdditional qualifications\nTo meet the diverse requirements for a competitive job, you need to combine hard and soft skills, demonstrating a balance of technical expertise and interpersonal abilities.\nHere's a look at each qualification type in more detail:\n‍\n1. Experience\nProfessional experience directly relating to the role is a crucial qualification.\nThis includes previous jobs, internships, co-ops, freelance work, and volunteer roles where you applied relevant skills and knowledge. Quantifying achievements with metrics helps demonstrate the impact of your experience.\n\n‍\nWhere to place experience qualifications on your resume\nPosition your Experience section prominently, typically right after your statement of qualifications.\nThis ensures hiring managers see your relevant experience early on, making a strong impression immediately.\n‍\nHow to add experience qualifications on your resume\nIdentify relevant experiences: Review your past roles and identify instances where you used skills pertinent to the new job. Even if the job settings differ, the skills might still be relevant.\nQuantify achievements: Whenever possible, add numbers to your achievements. For example, \"Increased sales by 20%\" or \"Managed a team of 10.\"\nTailor descriptions for the role: Modify the descriptions of your past job duties to emphasize the relevance to the new position. Use keywords from the job description to improve your resume’s relevance score in an ATS screening.\nInclude non-traditional experience: Don't overlook non-traditional work like freelance projects, volunteer positions, or internships. These can also demonstrate crucial skills and a proactive attitude toward professional development.\nFocus on transferable skills: Especially when shifting careers, present your experience in a way that focuses on skills transferable to the new job. This might involve re-framing tasks and responsibilities to highlight relevant skills.\nOnce you've strategically positioned your experience and tailored the content to align with job requirements, you can significantly enhance the appeal of your resume to potential employers.\nTeal's AI Resume Builder can help you highlight your experience qualifications by automatically identifying and quantifying your achievements. It suggests specific metrics and action verbs that make your experience more compelling.\n‍\nThis tool ensures your experience is presented in a way that aligns perfectly with the job you're applying for, increasing your chances of catching a hiring manager's eye.\n‍\nTips for addressing lack of experience\nIf you don’t have direct experience in the field you’re applying to, or if you are changing career paths, focus on transferable skills. Highlight aspects of your previous roles that are applicable to the new job, top skills such as project management skills, leadership skills, problem-solving skills, and technical skills.\nIf you managed projects in a different industry, emphasize your project management skills and how they can apply to the new role. For example, customer service skills are increasingly recognized as essential transferable skills that can be applied to various job roles, enhancing your ability to handle customer interactions, diffuse difficult situations, and provide helpful information across industries.\nHave too much experience? Read this to learn what to do when you’re overqualified for a job. \n‍\n2. Education\nAcademic degrees, certifications, licenses, training programs, and coursework all qualify for your resume  education section.\nThese showcase your commitment to learning and development within a particular field.\n‍\nWhere to add education qualifications on your resume\nThe placement of the Education section can vary depending on your level of experience and the relevance of your educational background to the job.\nFor recent graduates or those with less professional experience, the Education section should be placed near the top of the resume, just after the Objective or Summary section.\n‍\nFor seasoned professionals, it can be placed after the Experience section, as professional achievements may take precedence.\n‍\nHow to add education qualifications on your resume\nFor recent graduates: Emphasize your education by detailing relevant coursework, academic achievements, and projects that relate to the job. This can compensate for lacking work experience.\nFor career changers or those with relevant coursework: If you're changing careers or have taken courses relevant to the new field, highlight this education prominently.\nExplain how this education provides a foundation for your career change and equips you with necessary skills.\nFor those without formal degrees in the field: If you lack a formal degree in the area you are applying to but have professional certifications, continuing education courses, or licenses, highlight these to demonstrate your dedication to professional growth and relevance to the job requirements.\n‍\nTips for addressing education qualifications\nDetail your educational background: List your degrees in reverse chronological order, starting with the most recent. Include the name of the institution, location, degree obtained, and graduation date. For ongoing education, you can note \"Expected graduation [year].\"\nHighlight relevant coursework and certifications: If certain courses or certifications are particularly relevant to the job, include these details. Describe how specific courses have prepared you for the role.\nEmphasize continuing education: If you've taken part in any professional development courses or workshops that enhance your qualifications for the position, list these to show your initiative and commitment to staying current in your field.\nUse bullet points for clarity: Especially when listing multiple degrees or certifications, use bullet points to keep the section organized and easy to read.\nCustomize for each application: Tailor your Education section for each job application. If a job description emphasizes certain educational requirements or preferences, make sure these are clearly addressed in your resume.\nPro tip: Teal's match scoring feature is perfect for creating resumes tailored to specific job descriptions.\n‍\n‍\n3. Skills\nBoth hard skills (technical abilities specific to the job) and soft skills (interpersonal traits) are important qualifications, and effectively showcasing these resume skills together on your resume is crucial.\nHard skills could include proficiency in software, programming languages, equipment, data analysis, and project management skills, emphasizing their relevance in efficiently executing projects and achieving business goals\nSoft skills include communication skills, leadership skills, interpersonal skills, active listing skills, and problem-solving skills, which are crucial across various job roles.\nToday, highlighting computer skills and technical skills on a resume is increasingly important, regardless of the job’s focus on technology.\n‍\nWhere to add skill qualifications on your resume\nThe resume Skills section should be prominently displayed near the bottom of your resume after your Experience and Education.\nThis is the icing on the cake to make your core competencies explicitly clear.\n‍\nHow to add skill qualifications on your resume\nFor tech-heavy roles: Focus on listing hard skills such as software proficiency, programming languages, and other technical tools or methodologies. Be specific by including versions of software or platforms, and consider your level of expertise for each.\nFor leadership or team-based positions: Emphasize soft skills like leadership, teamwork, communication, and organizational abilities. Provide examples of these skills in action, possibly linking them to achievements listed in the experience section.\nFor roles requiring both types of skills: Balance your listing of hard and soft skills. Start with the skills most critical to the job based on the job description. If both are equally important, alternate between hard and soft skills to create a well-rounded profile.\n‍\nSkill qualification tips\nIdentify the most relevant skills: Review the job description to determine which skills are most valued for the role. Highlight these skills first and foremost in your resume.\nQuantify your technical skills: Whenever possible, back up your technical skills with specific examples or achievements that demonstrate your proficiency. For instance, “Developed a custom data analysis tool using Python that increased report generation speed by 50%.”\nIllustrate soft skills with real-world examples: Instead of simply listing soft skills, pair them with brief examples that demonstrate how you’ve effectively used these skills. For example, “Led a team of six in a project that delivered on time and under budget, enhancing team collaboration and problem-solving capabilities.”\nKeep formatting clear and consistent: Use bullet points to organize your skills. This format is easy to read and allows hiring managers to quickly scan your qualifications.\nTailor your skills for each application: Adjust your skills section for each job you apply to, emphasizing the skills most relevant to each position. This customization makes your resume more targeted and compelling.\nTeal's AI Resume Builder can analyze job descriptions to pinpoint the most relevant skills for a particular role, helping you highlight both hard and soft skills that are critical for the job. \n\nThe tool suggests specific skills to include and provides examples of effectively presenting these skills, ensuring your resume stands out to hiring managers and ATS systems.\n‍\n4.

Emphasize the qualifications most relevant to each position. This may require rearranging the order of qualifications or omitting less relevant details to keep the section concise and targeted.\nHighlight transferable skills: If changing industries or roles, focus on qualifications that showcase transferable skills or notable achievements that will be relevant in a variety of contexts.\nYou can capture the attention of hiring managers by clearly demonstrating how your unique skills and experiences make you an ideal candidate for the position.\n‍\nHow to list qualifications on a resume\nWhen listing qualifications on your resume, it's important to be clear, concise, and quantifiable.

This should be directly related to the role you are applying for, ensuring relevance to potential employers.\n‍\nStep 3: Add a metric\nQuantification creates impact.\nAdd numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, or time frames to your achievements to illustrate the magnitude of your contributions.\n‍\nStep 4: Include the result or outcome\nConclude with a positive result or outcome.\nHighlight how your action, skill, or task led to a benefit for your employer or project.\n‍\nStep 5: Focus on achievements over duties\nEmphasize your notable achievements rather than routine daily duties. Focus on instances where you delivered added value.\n‍\nStep 6: Tailor your qualifications to the job description\nAlign your qualifications with the job description.\nCustomize your resume for each application to mirror the requirements of the role.\n‍\nStep 7: Maintain consistent formatting\nUse consistent formatting for your qualifications.\nBullet points, the same tense, and the same style throughout make your resume easier to read and more professional.\n‍\nStep 8: Be clear and jargon-free\nEnsure your qualifications are easily understood.

It's the first thing employers see, and it needs to convey your professional value quickly.

You'll also discover the key elements to include, see resume profile examples from various industries, and get step-by-step instructions for writing your own standout profile.\nNeed a resume profile? Make a free resume with Teal and use AI generation to get it done—fast.\n‍\nWhat is a resume profile?\nA resume profile is a short statement that summarizes your key qualifications and strengths designed to immediately capture hiring managers, recruiters, and prospective employers' attention and convey why you're an excellent fit for the position.\nAs prime resume real estate, your resume profile sits at the very top of your resume, underneath your name, contact information, and target title. \nIt is a concise snapshot (around five sentences), highlighting your most relevant and compelling qualifications and experience that aligns with what a future employer is looking for.\n\n‍\nResume profile vs. resume summary \nResume profiles and resume summaries are often used interchangeably, with good reason. Both provide a snapshot of your professional identity to grab the employer's attention. The main difference? A profile is more results-driven, focusing on tangible skills and specific achievements. A resume summary offers a broader overview, potentially including softer skills or general qualifications.\n‍\nResume profile vs. resume objective\nThe distinction between resume profiles and resume objectives is clearer. A resume profile showcases what you bring to the table, highlighting specific skills and achievements.\nA resume objective, however, talks about your career goals or aspirations. It's typically used by career changers, new grads, or those returning to the workforce. Unless you fall into these categories, an objective might not be your best choice. It can seem self-centered and doesn't immediately show your value.\n‍\nBenefits of a strong resume profile\nA professional resume profile helps you stand out, make a strong impression, and grab the attention of hiring managers. \nA well-written resume profile statement can be a great way to differentiate yourself from other candidates because it sets the stage for the rest of the resume—providing a concise overview of your tangible, measurable qualifications, skills, and achievements. \n‍\nSo, how does crafting an engaging and compelling profile encourage employers to read further and dive into the details of your experience?\nGrabs attention by highlighting your most relevant and impressive qualifications immediately, ensuring that the reader takes notice.\nMakes an impression by enabling you to showcase unique strengths, expertise, and accomplishments—demonstrating why you're the ideal fit for the role.\nCreates interest by providing a compelling overview of your qualifications and achievements. It also generates curiosity and motivates the reader to explore the rest of the resume in detail.\nSets the stage by giving prospective employers a clear understanding of your background and establishing a strong foundation for the following information.\nShowcases unique value by providing an opportunity to highlight specific achievements, awards, or certifications that demonstrate your exceptional abilities and impact.\n‍\n\n‍\nWhat to include in a resume profile \nYour resume profile should showcase your most relevant experience, skills, and achievements with a focus on impact. Always aim to include measurable results.\n‍\nAs a resume introduction, your resume profile should include:\nYears of experience\nKey skills relevant to the job\nMost impressive achievements with quantifiable results\nRelevant certifications or education\nUnique value proposition - what sets you apart?\nRemember, keep it concise and impactful. Your goal is to grab the employer's attention and make them want to read more about you.\n‍\nProfessional title\nClearly state your professional title, highlighting your expertise. And remember, your resume title or target title (the title you're aiming for) should sit above your \"Resume Profile\" section. This helps employers quickly understand your specialization.\n‍\nSummary statement\nCraft a concise summary of your key qualifications, skills, and achievements. Focus on tangible results and notable experiences (but only those relevant and significant to the role you're applying for).\n‍\nRelevant experience\nHighlight your work experience, emphasizing specific accomplishments, projects, or roles that demonstrate your skills and expertise. Quantify your achievements with measurable results to showcase your impact.\n‍\nKey skills\nList your core skills and competencies that are relevant to the position. Include both technical and soft skills, using industry-specific keywords to optimize your profile and grab attention. Highlight areas of strength like strong leadership, problem-solving abilities, teamwork, or adaptability and connect them to data whenever possible.\n‍\nIndustry-related keywords from the job description\nIncorporate relevant keywords and industry-specific terminology throughout your profile. This helps align your profile with the requirements of the target role and enhances your chances of being noticed by hiring managers.\n‍\nAchievements\nShowcase specific accomplishments and successes, like awards, recognitions, or impressive measurable outcomes from your previous roles. Provide quantifiable results to demonstrate your impact.\n‍\nProfessional associations or affiliations\n If you're feeling light on quantifiable metrics, it's okay to mention any memberships in professional organizations, industry affiliations, or leadership roles that demonstrate your commitment to professional development and staying current in your field. Include numbers like years you've been a member or data about your participation.\n‍\nLanguage proficiency\n If applicable to the role you're applying for, include any language skills that are relevant to the role or industry. Fluency in multiple languages or proficiency in specific languages can be an asset, particularly in global work environments.\n‍\nHow to write a resume profile summary\nA well-crafted resume profile summary is like a short professional bio that typically consists of three key parts: an introductory statement, one or two sentences highlighting your skills and achievements, and at least one metric. This structure allows you to quickly capture the employer's attention and showcase your value and impact.\n‍\n1. Title your section\nIf you opt for a title, keep it simple and clear. Use \"Professional Profile,\" \"Professional Summary,\" or simply \"Profile.\" This title immediately signals to the employer what they're about to read, setting the stage for your career snapshot.\n‍\n2. Introductory statement\nStart with a powerful opener that summarizes your professional identity. This should be a concise statement that encapsulates your years of experience, industry, and primary skill set.\nFor example:\nSaaS marketing leader with 8 years of experience in digital campaign management, print and digital media, and brand development.\n‍\n3. 1-2 statements highlighting skills and achievements (with impact)\nProvide specific achievements that demonstrate your value. Focus on results that align with the job you're applying for, and include at least one quantifiable metric to show your impact.\nFor instance: \"I spearheaded innovative social media strategies that increased engagement by 150%, leading to a 25% boost in sign-up revenue. I've led cross-functional teams of 10+ to deliver 7+ marketing campaigns. In addition, my data-driven approach using tools like Google Analytics, Clarity, and AHREFS for content creation increased branded traffic by 40% year-over-year.\"\n‍\nPro Tip: Want to skip the examples and get straight to the point?

And there’s some truth to it: Many employers do use software to help speed up the recruitment process.\n\nHowever, if you have visions of cartoon robots meticulously sorting through tall stacks of applications with their many arms, that’s not what’s happening. Recruiters and hiring managers rely on resume parsing software to help sort and vet applicants.\n\nWhat is resume parsing? How is it used in the hiring process? And how can you make sure your own document makes it past those first-round robots? This guide covers everything you need to know about resume parsing:\n\nWhat resume parsing is and why it matters\n3 common resume parsing issues\nMake it past the parser\nFAQs about resume parsing\nStruggling to land interviews with your resume? Get started with Teal’s AI Resume Builder today.\n\nUnderstanding resume parsing: What it is and why it matters\nResume parsing is the process of using software to extract, analyze, categorize, and store information from a resume—usually to find the applicants that are the best fit for the open role. Resume parsing tools often come with an employer’s applicant tracking system (ATS), so they don’t need an entirely separate resume parser to sort through documents.\n\nYou don’t need to understand the technical ins and outs of resume parsing software to make it through your job search. But in general, these tools work like this:\n\nExtract the resume data: The parsing software scans the resume to identify and pull out any relevant data points (like your name, contact details, work history, education history, skills, and more).\nAnalyze the resume data: It uses algorithms to analyze the extracted information and better understand the structure and context.\nClean up the resume data: It standardizes the candidate information into a format that makes it easy to process, search, and compare.\nEnter and store the resume data: Parsed data is stored directly in a database or the ATS so it can be used for further resume screening and evaluation.\nPut simply, rather than a hiring manager needing to weed through every single resume submitted, resume parsers do the first step for them to surface the most suitable candidates. \n\nHow do keywords work in resume parsing?\nDifferent employers use several types of parsing processes when hiring. But in most cases, when candidates talk about the dreaded “robots” reviewing their applications, they’re referring to keyword-based parsing.\n\nIn keyword-based resume screening, the parsing software scans resumes looking for specific keywords and phrases the employer set up within the software. For example, if the employer is only considering potential candidates who are proficient in Photoshop, they could enter “Photoshop” as a keyword within the CV parsing software.\n\nAdd Keywords to Your Resume\n‍\n\n‍\n\nWhen that’s in place, the resume parser scans all of the submitted documents for that keyword and surfaces only the ones that meet the criteria. That way, recruiters only review applications from  candidates whose qualifications match the job description.\n\nAs a candidate, it’s easy to think of this automated first step as a barrier in the screening process. But resume parsing tools don’t exist to hurt applicants—they exist to help recruiters. Ultimately, parsing software reduces the manual processes involved in resume screening and saves time for recruiters who are responsible for finding the most qualified candidates. \n\nTo learn more about how an ATS scans for keywords within resumes, check out this guide to applicant tracking system keywords. \n\n3 common resume parsing problems (and how to avoid them)\nThe resume parsing benefits for employers are obvious. It’s a speedy and cost-effective way for them to sort through a vast number of resumes and get the candidate information they need to make informed hiring decisions.\n\nAnd, while you can take some comfort in the fact that the parsing process isn’t intended to stand in your way as a job seeker, there can still be some hiccups in the candidate experience when an employer relies on resume parsing technology.\n\nDon’t panic yet—there are steps you can take to help your resume make it past the parser and get your most impressive and relevant information in front of the hiring manager.\n\nHere’s a look at three of the most common resume parsing problems, and how you can make sure they don’t hold you back.\n\n1. Using messy formatting\nIf there’s one thing to know about parsing software, it’s this: It likes to spit out structured data, and it has a much easier time generating clean and accurate data when resumes are organized. In short, it’s hard to parse resumes that are jumbled or lack a clear order.\n\nWhen it comes to your file format, there’s a long-running myth that only Word document resumes can be parsed. That’s not true—modern resume parsers are capable of scanning various formats, including PDFs.\n\nFormatting tips to make it past resume parsing:\n\nKeep your resume format simple and clean. Choose a common font (like Arial, Cambria, or Times New Roman), avoid too many colors or graphic elements, and ensure there’s enough white space to balance your text. All of the templates within Teal’s Resume Builder are compatible with parsers.\nLabel your sections clearly. Use intuitive language to label your sections (for example, put “work experience” above your work history) along with resume headers that are bolder and slightly bigger than the rest of your text.\nFollow the employer’s directions for submitting your resume. Take note of what resume formats they accept and if you need to use a specific naming convention for your document file.\n2. Neglecting keywords\nIt’s hard to overstate the importance of keywords when creating an ATS-friendly resume.\n\nThe parser combs through your work experience, skills, summary, and other candidate data looking for specific terms. If they appear on your document, you increase your chances of landing in the “to be interviewed” pile. \n\nYou’re not a mind-reader, so how can you figure out what keywords to include? It hinges on taking a closer look at the job descriptions for open roles you're considering. \n\nOptimize Your Resume with Keywords\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nKeyword tips to make it past parsing\nDon’t neglect the importance of tailoring your resume. Parsers aren’t looking for great people—they’re looking for great potential hires, meaning people who demonstrate that they’re a clear fit for the open role. You can’t connect those dots for the employer if you use the same, generic resume for every single position.\njob description keywords\nJob seekers use Teal to match their resume to the job description\nTeal's AI Resume Builder\n\nComb through the job description. When you’re looking for clues about what to include in your document, the job posting itself is your best resource. Pay close attention to what the employer is asking for, such as certain skills or responsibilities that are emphasized. You can analyze the job description manually or use the Matching feature within Teal’s AI Resume Builder to attach the posting to your resume and see how your content matches up.\nIncorporate relevant keywords. When you identify something that seems important to the employer, that should be added somewhere on your resume. Again, you can do this on your own, but it’s easier with Teal’s Job Description Keyword Finder and Matching Mode, which quickly scans job descriptions for the most important keywords, while providing a “match score” to help you build a resume that stands out to employers.\nPrioritize honesty. Keywords matter, but honesty does too. Resist the urge to list skills and qualifications you don’t actually possess just to make it through the first round of screening. That will only come back to bite you later in the hiring process.\nTo learn more about selecting the right keywords for your resume, read this guide to resume keywords and make more strategic choices. \n\n3. Assuming that parsing won’t happen\nHere’s one of the worst things you can do: Assume that an employer won’t use a resume parser. \n\nThere’s often a lack of transparency in hiring processes, which makes it tough to know for certain whether or not a company is relying on this type of recruitment software. But your safest bet is to assume that every company is using resume parsing software and adjust your resume accordingly. Plus, the same best practices that make your resume more appealing to a resume parser also make it more appealing to recruiters, so you can’t go wrong either way.\n\nAdditional tips to make it past parsing\nDo a detailed resume analysis. The Analysis feature in Teal’s Resume Builder gives your resume an overall resume score, as well as personalized suggestions for ways you can make your resume even stronger. It’s a great way to go beyond only keywords and ensure your resume is all-around impressive.\nTake your time. When you’re eager to apply for a position, it’s tempting to fire off your resume as quickly as possible. Slow down and take a breath. Rushing leads to errors and other oversights. Remember, a resume you sped through isn’t likely to be your best one. \nOf course, there are some other potential problems with parsing—like machine learning algorithms failing to capture some of your job data correctly. As always, technology has its shortcomings.\n\nUnfortunately, you don’t have any control over the inner workings of the resume parser an employer is using. However, you do have control over the resume you submit. That’s where you should focus your time, energy, and attention. \n\nFor more tips on making it past a resume parser, check out this comprehensive guide on how to optimize your resume for ATS. \n\nTailor Your Resume to a Job Description\n‍\n\nMake it past resume parsers\nFeel intimidated by applicant tracking, resume parsing software, and all of the potential wrenches this technology can throw in the recruitment process?

But where do you include projects in a resume to have the most impact in a way that differentiates you and impresses prospective employers?\n\nWhether you're a freelancer with a diverse portfolio, a professional aiming to showcase your accomplishments, a recent graduate with academic projects, or someone looking to make a career change, effectively showcasing your project experience can distinguish you in a way that helps drive your career.\n\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nWhy including projects on your resume can make a difference\nIncluding relevant projects on your resume can significantly impact how hiring managers or recruiters view your qualifications. If you're wondering how to write experience on a resume, projects are a fantastic way showcase your skills, creativity, initiative, and problem-solving abilities. And they offer tangible evidence of everything you're capable of while adding depth to your resume beyond traditional work or educational experience.\n\nWhat kinds of projects should you put on a resume?\nAcademic projects demonstrate your ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations.\nPersonal projects reflect your passion, self-motivation, and dedication.\nTeam projects highlight your collaboration, communication, and teamwork skills.\nFreelance projects reveal your entrepreneurial spirit, client management skills, and ability to deliver results independently.\nVolunteer projects emphasize your commitment to community service, teamwork, and social causes.\nLeadership projects reveal your ability to take charge, inspire others, and drive successful outcomes.\nAnd while most projects contribute to growth through the lessons or skills you’ve learned, the key to including projects in a resume is choosing ones relevant to the job description or industry you're targeting.\n\nChoosing the right projects ensures that those you list resonate with the hiring manager, showcasing your expertise in a way that directly relates to the position you're applying for.\n\nWhen should you include projects on your resume?\nDeciding whether to include projects on your resume largely depends on your professional circumstances and the specific job you're applying for. \n\nSo, which professional scenarios would benefit from the impact projects offer? \n\nWhen you're a freelancer or contract worker\nProjects are often a primary form of work for freelancers or contractors. And, if you’ve found yourself in this professional realm, you should prominently showcase them as resume accomplishments within your “Work Experience” section. Think of creating your work experience as a more project-based resume section instead. (Just remember to be mindful of any non-disclosure agreements you may have signed before listing any client-identifying information.)\n\nFor example, imagine you're a freelance web designer who completed a website revamp for a client in coffee distribution. In this case, you didn't sign a non-disclosure agreement, so you're free to use their name, metrics, and more. Here's how you would highlight the project on your resume:\n\nWebsite Redesign: Bigbie Coffee\n\nCreated visually appealing and user-friendly website interface featuring responsive design, intuitive navigation, and enhanced branding.\nReceived positive client feedback on new website's aesthetics, functionality, and improved user experience.\nResulted in a 30% increase in website traffic within the first month of the redesign implementation\nRedesign resulted in a 20% increase in online orders and a 15% rise in average transaction value.\nWhen you're a student or recent graduate\nEspecially if you're a student or recent graduate creating a resume with limited professional experience, showcasing academic projects in a resume can serve as valuable evidence of your skills, knowledge, and initiative—positioning you as a qualified and capable candidate.\n\nFor instance, if you've recently graduated college with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, a resume project could look like this:  \n\nSenior CS-450 Software Development Project\n\nDeveloped a comprehensive task management application utilizing Java and JavaScript, allowing users to create, assign, and track tasks, set deadlines, and collaborate with team members seamlessly.\nReceived an outstanding grade of 99% for the project—showcasing excellence in software design, implementation, and functionality.\nReceived positive feedback from both professors and classmates on the application's intuitive user interface, robust functionality, and efficient task management capabilities.\nWhen you're changing careers \nTransferable skills are the bread and butter of any career changer's resume. They highlight valuable abilities, demonstrate soft skills, and convey knowledge you've acquired that applies to other careers, industries, or professional spaces.\n\nAs a career changer, key projects demonstrate transferable skills and showcase your passion and knowledge for the target industry or field you are transitioning into.\n\nLet's say you're shifting from financial services to sales. In that case, showcasing a leadership project, like spearheading a cross-functional team to implement a CRM system that resulted in improved sales processes, streamlined communication, and increased client retention rates, would be applicable. This is because the leadership skills, communication, and problem-solving skills demonstrated in this project are highly transferable to sales. \n\nSo how could that look as a project in a resume? \n\nCRM Implementation for Enhanced Sales Processes and Client Retention\n\nLed a team of 10 in successfully implementing a CRM system within the financial services department.\nFacilitated cross-functional collaboration between sales, marketing, and IT teams, ensuring smooth adoption and integration within seven business days.\nCRM implementation resulted in a 25% improvement in efficiency, reduced manual effort, and enabled teams to focus on client interactions, leading to a 15% increase in client retention rates within six months.\nWhen you don’t have much relevant work experience\nIf you're trying to create a resume with no work experience or have minimal relevant experience, personal projects can help demonstrate ability, initiative, and dedication. \n\nImagine you've been out of the workforce for some time. What personal projects might be relevant if you're applying for a job role in software marketing? Volunteering for a school PTO, organizing a fundraising campaign, maintaining a personal blog or website, or creating social media campaigns for various causes are all valuable and relevant in marketing.\n\n So how can you add one of those examples as a project description in a resume?\n\nCulinary Lifestyle Blog: Gourmet Delights\n\nSuccessfully maintained and curated a culinary lifestyle blog, \"Gourmet Delights,\" for four years, focusing on exploring unique flavors, recipes, and culinary experiences.\nIncreased website traffic year over year, achieving a remarkable 200x growth in monthly page views and engagement YoY through effective content creation and promotion strategies.\nRecognized for consistent updating and high-quality content, leading to partnerships with renowned brands and selection for paid advertisements, establishing the blog as a trusted resource within the culinary community.\nWhen you’re applying for project-based roles\nIf you're applying for a project-based role such as project manager, coordinator, or administrator, showcasing the skills you've developed by completing various projects demonstrates competence and experience. \n\nAs a resume project, this could look something like the following: \n\nSoftware Implementation - StreamlineX\n\nLed the successful implementation of the StreamlineX software solution, overseeing a team of 10 developers, coordinating activities, and ensuring timely delivery.\nMet all project deadlines with 100% on-time delivery, effectively managing project milestones and dependencies.\nCompleted the project within the allocated budget, achieving a cost savings of 15% by optimizing resources and streamlining processes.\nImproved overall efficiency by 20%, as measured by reduced processing time and increased productivity, resulting in a 30% decrease in customer support inquiries\nBuild Your Resume\n‍\n\nStrategies for listing projects on your resume\nListing projects throughout different sections of your resume can be done strategically in a way that highlights your accomplishments and demonstrates relevant skills in an easily digestible format. \n\nShowcasing projects in a dedicated “Project” section\nIf your relevant experience is the sum of multiple projects, it might be worth adding a separate \"Projects\" section to your resume. \n\nFormatted the same way you would a comprehensive \"Work Experience\" section, a \"Projects\" section would include:\n\nName of the project \nThe organization you were with while completing that project\nDates started and completed\nThe scope (for example, the size of the team, project duration, or budget)\nAny feedback received \nMeasurable results \nA screenshot of a section for projects in a resume \nAdd a \"Projects\" section to highlight the depth of your experience.\nIncluding projects in your \"Work Experience\" section\nWhen including projects that were part of your work experience, provide clear details of the project's scope, your role, and the outcomes achieved.

Choose relevant projects: Recruiters and hiring managers seek specific skills that align with the role they want to fill. List projects relevant to the role you're applying for can help you stand out as a qualified candidate whose experience aligns with the job requirements.\n\n2. Showcase your role in the project: Were you collaborating with a large group? Leading a team? Exclusively responsible for the project's outcome? Clearly defining your role can offer prospective employers an idea of your abilities, responsibilities, and team interaction skills.\n\n3. Include quantifiable bullet points: Showcasing numbers, metrics, and data whenever possible provides a tangible understanding of the impact of your work. \n\n4. Use action verbs: Action verbs and keywords from the job description draw attention to your skills and experiences by conveying a powerful sense of movement.\n\n5. Tailor the project descriptions for each job application: Using keywords and language from the job description not only shows that your qualifications align with a specific role but also conveys your understanding of the role's requirements.\n\nPro Tip: The Teal Job Application Tracker pulls keywords and other important language from the job description to help you tailor your resume for every role. \n\nResume project don'ts\n1. Don't overload your resume with projects: Listing projects on a resume can be exciting! After all, you're proud of all you've accomplished. But unless you have limited or no work experience, don't include too many projects. It's best to include only those most relevant projects or impressive projects in addition to other achievements and impact.\n\n2. Don't be vague: Using specific details about your role, the project's objective, and the outcome can give recruiters or hiring managers a clear understanding of your key skills and abilities.\n\n3. Don't forget to mention the team size: If the project was a team effort, include the team size to offer insight into the work environment you're accustomed to. \n\n4. Don't neglect the job-specific skills used or gained: Skills are often part of the keywords from a job description, and incorporating them into your projects helps showcase your alignment with the role.\n\n5. Don't skip proofreading: Show your attention to detail by proofreading your projects (and entire resume!) for spelling and grammar mistakes. \n\nAdd A Project To Your Resume\n‍\n\nInspiring examples of projects listed on resumes\nHighlighting impactful projects on your resume can show employers your capabilities, creativity, and motivation.

Yet, the portfolio and resume are two very different ways to communicate your work experience. \n\nWhich one do you need? And which do you present to prospective employers at what moment? It’s never really a conversation of resume versus portfolio. It’s about understanding how your portfolio complements your resume and when to use each. This guide discusses the similarities, key differences, and unique qualities of each tool—so you can present yourself as the best candidate for the job.\n\nStruggling to land interviews with your resume?

It’s typically one or two pages long, created in Microsoft Word or similar. In addition to work history, it typically includes:\n\nWork experience\nProfessional summary\nSoft skills\nAcademic history, GPA\nContact details\nVolunteer work\nUse This Resume Template\n‍\n\n\nSample resume, made in Teal\n‍\n\nThe resume has a long-standing history as the most common document you’ll need to apply for a job. Although what’s typical on a resume may change according to country, its format remains universal and hasn’t changed much throughout its history. \n\nCreate Your Best Resume For Free\n‍\n\nWhat is a portfolio?\nA work portfolio serves as a creative, comprehensive compilation of your professional accomplishments, designed to highlight your skills and experience for recruiters, clients, or a potential employer. It provides visual evidence of your specific skills. Also known as a career portfolio or professional portfolio, it typically highlights:\n\nWork projects\nAwards\nAchievements\nCase studies\nexample career portfolio\nExample portfolio by Joachim Lepine for translation and journalism\n‍\n\nWhat are the similarities and differences?\nThe similarities lie in their function—they’re both used in the job application stage to help you land an interview. \n\nWhile portfolios are more common in creative fields, you’ll likely need both a portfolio and resume to stand out. In a competitive market, a resume is a given, proving your value with a portfolio gives a leg up. Can you include a portfolio in a resume? The answer is yes (more details on this below). \n\nHere are some additional similarities between portfolios and resumes: \n\nThey may both be presented in PDF format\nRecruiters will receive both \nThey’re created for the job you want \nThey’re designed to show off your experience\nThere is a key difference or two (or three!) which will help paint a picture of when each item is used, how it's created, and why it's needed—so you can send each one at the appropriate time, with confidence.\n\n‍\n\ndifferences between a resume and portfolio\nThe main differences between a resume and a portfolio, explained.\n‍\n\nHere’s how a CV compares to a resume and portfolio:\n\nA CV is short for Curriculum Vitae and more detailed than a resume.

To get a better sense of the nuances, take a look at our selection of CV Examples for specific job titles to see what successful CV looks like.\n\n‍\n\nThis article focuses on the differences between portfolio and resume specifically. \n\n‍\n\nThe role of a resume\nResumes help hiring managers get an overview of all the relevant skills you possess and decide whether to invite you for an interview. It’s an integral part of the job search and job application process. You may send in a resume in a job application, or you may upload your resume to job search sites for recruiters to find you.\n\nResumes come in different formats with differing sections, but there are universal items that should be included. In general, the ideal resume length is one or two pages. This keeps it compact, organized, and succinct. Recruiters review hundreds or thousands of applications weekly, so a powerful, succinct summary helps you get noticed. \n\n‍\n\nWhat to include: Academic and professional qualifications\nSummary Statement: A one- to three-sentence paragraph at the top of a resume which highlights your professional qualifications and career goals. It serves as an introduction to yourself as a professional. \n\nWork Experience: A list of your previous employment, complete with job titles, company names, dates of employment, and a bulleted list of responsibilities and achievements under each role. This takes up the majority of the content.\n\nPro Tip: If you lack enough work experience to fill out a one-page resume, you can consider adding a volunteer section to your resume. \n\nRelevant skills: A section to highlight your relevant soft skills or technical skills relevant to a specific job. \n\nEducation: A section dedicated to your educational background such as which high school or university you attended, including graduation dates, degrees, and any relevant honors or awards.\n\nContact Info: Essential information about how to reach you such as your full name, phone number, email address, home address or city, and possibly a LinkedIn profile.\n\n‍\n\nWhat you need to know about resumes\nThe resume is designed for functionality. It should be keyword-optimized for ATS (applicant tracking system) to ensure you appear in search results during your job search.\n\nWith an overview of your entire history, it should remain easy to update and change depending on the role. As it’s traditionally in letter format, it’s easy to print copies. In fact, it’s best practice to bring copies of your resume to the first interview. \n\nStanding out in the job market is tough! Make your job search easier with Teal’s AI-powered Resume Builder, created to help you craft impactful AI-generated resume summaries, bullets, and more.\n\nWrite Resume Achievements with AI\n‍\n\n‍\n\nThe role of a portfolio\nPortfolios help employers get a visual overview of your talent and decide if you have what it takes to create something similar for them in the role. It’s a deliverable that complements the resume and the cover letter in the traditional sense; although, freelance creatives may use the portfolio as the only deliverable sent to potential clients. \n\nProfessionals most likely to need a portfolio include:\n\nArtists\nWriters\nJournalists\nArchitects\nMarketers\nPhotographers\nModels & Actresses \nEngineers\nDesigners\nPortfolios come in different formats and can be as unique as your work style. You can create one on a free portfolio-building website, a design platform to create as a PDF, or built on a job platform like LinkedIn. When you’re vying for the attention of prospective employers, a resume is not always enough. Grab their attention by showcasing your best work in a portfolio. \n\n‍\n\nWhat to include: samples of a person’s professional skills\nYour best work: The premise of a portfolio is to showcase your most impressive work, often visually.\n\nA makeup artist shows their makeup looks.\nA writer shows published works and readership numbers.\nA graphic designer shows website designs.\nAn architect shows design plans and timelines.\nThis section is what the portfolio is built around and can be presented in a variety of layouts. \n\nProfessional achievements: This section provides some metrics or awards tied to the projects you present in the portfolio. Think of it as the “proof” your projects were successful and worthwhile. \n\nTestimonials or references: This portion should highlight a few kind words written by past employers or clients. While a resume may simply state “References available upon request” with the idea that the employers will do a background and reference check, a portfolio has the space to include them directly on the document. \n\nFreelancers will find this particularly useful as clients don’t typically run background or reference checks, and may prefer to read through the testimonials instead. \n\nContact info: Include essential information about how to reach you, such as your full name, phone number, email address, website, and social media profile handles. You can also include links to book a call with you or to fill out a contact form. \n\nYou can also include a bit about yourself, such as a philosophy statement.\n\nNeed a portfolio? Browse examples and best practices for creating a work portfolio.\n\n‍\n\nCan a portfolio replace a resume?\nA portfolio doesn't serve as a replacement for a resume. Rather, it’s best to imagine that the two go hand-in-hand—the resume being the main entrée with the portfolio acting as the side to complete the meal.\n\nHowever, there are instances in which a portfolio can replace a resume. \n\nYou’re a freelancer: It’s more common that a freelancer will need to show their skills rather than discuss them. That’s why a portfolio can replace a resume for freelancers looking to land new clients. \n\nThe specific job description asked for only a portfolio: Whether it’s for a traditional nine to five, a contract, or a freelance position, it’s possible (although, rare) that potential employers solicit a portfolio from job applicants, not a resume. In such a case, follow instructions. \n\nYou want a reason to follow up: \n\nIn the instance that the specific job application only allowed the inclusion of a resume, having a portfolio could serve as a great reason to get in touch with the hiring manager on LinkedIn.\n\nIdeally, your portfolio is linked within your resume, but it doesn’t hurt to also send your portfolio as a follow up. \n\n‍\n\nHow to incorporate your portfolio into your resume\nThe key to a well-rounded application is to add a portfolio link in your resume. That way, if a job application only hosts a slot to upload or input your resume, the hiring manager has access to your portfolio. \n\n‍\n\nResume with portfolio link examples\nportfolio and resume together\nBackend developer example resume with a portfolio link, made in Teal\n‍\n\nDavid Brown, Backend Developer, links to his GitHub account where hiring managers can explore his projects, view stored code to judge his coding skills, and see real life samples.\n\n‍\n\nportfolio and resume example content manager\nContent manager example resume with a portfolio link, made in Teal\n‍\n\nAvery Adams, Content Manager, links to her Behance, a portfolio-hosting platform. There, hiring managers can view her projects, strategies, and writing samples.\n\n‍\n\n\nProject manager example resume with a portfolio link, made in Teal\n‍\n\nLiam Chen, Project Manager, links to his website. There, the hiring manager can view his projects and services in more detail. Personal websites can serve as portfolios.\n\n‍\n\nAdd a LinkedIn link to your resume\nAll the resume examples above also link to their LinkedIn profile. \n\nHere’s how to link your portfolio in your LinkedIn profile:\n\nOn your profile, go to your contact info section. Click the pencil icon to edit.\nexample of an optimized LinkedIn portfolio page\nAn optimized LinkedIn portfolio page\n‍\n\nUnder contact info, you’ll see Profile URL. Click this URL. You’ll be taken to public profile settings.\n‍\n\nedit contact info on linkedin\nEdit your LinkedIn profile URL in the public profile settings\n‍\n\nIn the top right corner, you’ll see the section to edit your custom profile URL.\n‍\n\nedit custom url linkedin\nSet your custom LinkedIn profile URL to your name, if available\n‍\n\nType or edit the last part of your new custom public profile URL in the text box. We recommend your first and last name, or a variation of the sort. \nClick Save. \n‍\n\nShowcasing relevant work: Should you use media in your resume?\nYou may be wondering if it’s okay to use media in your resume or to show off a project or two. As mentioned in the resume section above, it’s important to keep your resume simple, succinct, and focused on what’s important to your ideal role. The first goal of the portfolio is to get an interview.Leverage the resume to quickly discuss key projects. That’s to say, if you do choose to mention specific projects, tie it to the achievements you brought to the company rather than focusing on single items. \n\nImprove Your Resume Achievements with AI\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nShow off your work bullets the right way\nIn summary, a resume is a career document needed to submit job applications. One or two pages long, it lists an overview of your work experience. A resume portfolio, on the other hand, is a complementary document that often spans multiple pages. Portfolios provide visual evidence of a person's work and relevant qualifications. Both are used to show off all relevant skills you have and land you a job interview.\n\nTo boost your career growth, consider creating a work portfolio to support your resume.\n\nNeed help creating an attention-grabbing resume?

It can even help you gain admission to even the most selective schools.\nAnd while you might be familiar with the standard resume format when applying for a job, what about the resume you need to apply for a PhD program? A PhD resume still needs to showcase your skills, accomplishments, and experience, but how you show your strengths—and how you format them—differs from a traditional resume.\nIn this guide, we’ll discuss what a PhD resume contains, how to create a resume for a PhD application, and even explore some CV examples and templates for you to use as a guide.\n‍\nNeed to create your PhD resume? Make a free resume in Teal today.\n\nUnderstanding the PhD resume\nA PhD resume is a document you submit as part of your application to a Doctor of Philosophy program. Sometimes called a PhD CV, this type of resume is to highlight your academic qualifications, research experience, and professional achievements.\nWhen you submit a PhD CV, you’re likely submitting to an admissions committee composed of faculty members and program coordinators. The goal? To impress these individuals with your academic and research qualifications and convince them you’d be a valuable addition to their program. \n‍\nPhD resume vs traditional resume\nBoth PhD resumes and traditional resumes aim to show you're a strong match for the position or criteria the recipient is evaluating. While you want to show you’re qualified in both scenarios, what you include in these documents and how you format that information is different.\nSpecifically, PhD resumes focus much more on academic and research experience, while traditional resumes focus on work experience. Because of this, PhD resumes tend to be longer and more detailed, often including sections to cover various research projects, publications, teaching experiences, and more—similar to a traditional or academic CV.\n\n‍\nEssential sections of a PhD CV\nA PhD CV needs clear sections that organize your education and academic background, your professional experience, and your key skills. Here are all of the essential sections of a PhD resume.\n‍\nContact Information\nYour contact information simply states your name, how the people reviewing your name can contact you, and where you’re located. Be sure to include:\nYour full name\nYour email address\nYour phone number\nYour city and state (no need to include your full address)\nUse Teal’s AI Resume Builder to format all relevant contact information seamlessly\n‍\nProfessional Summary\nYour resume summary gives an overview of who you are, your research experience and interests, and what research you hope to pursue as part of the PhD program. This should only be a few sentences. \nKeep your summary short and to the point\n‍\nEducation\nThe resume Education section will likely be one of the lengthiest on this type of resume. List your education history in reverse chronological order, meaning your most recent degree goes first.\nFor each part of this Education section, be sure to specify the type of degree, your major, the institution, and what years you were in school.\nList your education in reverse chronological order\nYou can also choose to list relevant courses, projects, or presentations, including your thesis or dissertation, as well as your GPA if you're a recent grad.\n‍\nResearch Experience\nYour Research Experience section should clearly outline any research projects you’ve been involved in. Include your specific role, methodologies, and your achievements with impact.\nWhen describing your achievements, quantify them whenever possible—whether that’s the number of publications you contributed to or how many conferences you presented at.\nQuantify your achievements to show impact\n‍\nTeaching Experience\nIncluding teaching experience in academia on this type of resume shows your experience working with students in academic positions—which may be a part of your job role in a prospective PhD program.\nEven if you won’t be teaching or assisting students with courses, teaching experience in academic positions shows soft skills like communication and presentation.\n‍\nIn reverse chronological order, include the title of the teaching position, the institution where you taught, and the courses, including their level (e.g., undergraduate or graduate).\nYou may also choose to include specific job responsibilities you had or notable achievements. For example, you may want to include evaluations, student outcomes, or awards on your resume.\nList your teaching experience to show you've worked in academic positions\nDepending on how much teaching and research experience you have, you may choose to combine these sections under one general “Experience” section.\n‍\nPublications\nThis section is for listing publications you’ve contributed to. Publications can include peer-reviewed journal articles, conference papers, published excerpts of your dissertation or thesis, reports, and books or book chapters.\n‍\nWhen listing publications, ensure they're presented in reverse chronological order. Pick the citation style (e.g. APA, Chicago, MLA) that’s most commonly used in your field. Include the publication title, authors, journal name, year of publication, and any relevant volume or issue numbers. If applicable, mention the specific role you played in the research and writing process. For more impactful publications, you can add a brief summary of the research findings or significance. \nShowcase your work by including publications\nIf you haven’t published any work yet, you can skip this section.\n‍\nPresentations and Conferences\nIf you’ve given a presentation or been a part of a conference, include this in a separate Presentations and Conferences experience section. Presentations and conferences can include academic or industry conferences, seminars and workshops, and webinars.\n‍\nIn reverse chronological order, be sure to include the conference title and location, presentation title, your role (presenter, co-presenter, panel member, etc.), and the date.\nInclude all relevant conference details in a Presentations and Conferences section\n‍\nSkills\nIf you’re applying for open position in a Doctor of Philosophy program, it’s likely you have a multitude of skills. However, you want to select the most relevant skills to the program you’re applying for.\n‍\nBe sure to include any key skills specified in the program description and the most relevant skills to the research you want to pursue, including technical skills or other hard skills.\nAdd multiple relevant skills to your resume and group by category, if applicable\nThese skills can be formatted as a bullet point list, grouped in sections by specific types of skills.\n‍\nReferences\nUnlike a regular resume where you shouldn’t include references—or even that references are available upon request—you’re typically expected to list references in a PhD resume. Be sure to look at the requirements listed on the application to see how many references you should include.\n\nUsually, you’ll be required to list two or three references. For each reference, include their name, title, place of work (if that’s an institution, the institution name), their phone number, and email.\nAlways include references on a PhD resume when required\n‍\n‍\nPhD CV example\nIn this PhD CV example, the candidate includes all of the relevant sections to show their own academic and professional experience, including their background studying, researching, and teaching in the computer science field.\n\n‍\nPhD resume template\nReady to make your own PhD resume? Here’s a CV example template to copy and paste and fill out with your own qualifications:\n‍\nYour Name \n[Your Email] [Your Phone Number] [Your City, State]\nProfessional Summary\nA [your subject] student with a strong foundation in [specific subject] seeking a PhD position to conduct research in [your field of research].

You’ll want to become familiar with the program description, course offerings, faculty research interests, and any specific requirements.\n‍\nThen, be sure to include:\nKeywords: Identify any key terms and phrases within the program description, including research areas, methodologies, and required skills (including technical skills).\nSimilar to resume keywords in a conventional job search, you’ll want to include these keywords to help you stand out when admissions committees scan your resume. You also want to remove any irrelevant skills. (For example, your skills in project management may be relevant to industry jobs like research operations manager but may not align with the specific research focus of certain PhD programs.)\nProgram requirements: If there’s a minimum GPA, specific coursework, research requirements, or skills the program is looking for, add these to your resume. \nTransferable skills: Highlight key skills that might be valuable to the program, whether that’s research skills, soft skills like critical thinking or problem-solving, or skills relevant to the program’s specific focus—include them alongside impact to showcase how you used them.\nRelated experience: Mention related roles or projects on your resume that showcase your academic and research abilities. For example, if you have experience as a teaching assistant (TA) or research assistant (RA), or relevant coursework, honors, or awards from your bachelor’s or master’s degree, including these on your PhD resume can showcase your experience, skills, and potential.\nBy carefully tailoring your PhD resume to each program, you can increase your chances of making a strong impression and securing admission to your desired program.\n‍\nTips for optimizing your PhD CV\nNot only do you need to tailor your PhD resume to the specific program you’re applying for, but you’ll also need to think about resume optimization to ensure your PhD resume’s ATS compatibility. ATS (applicant tracking systems) are used to help file and organize resumes.\n‍\nTo ensure your resume is optimized for ATS, focus on:\nKeyword integration: Those searching these systems often rely on specific keywords to identify qualified applications, which means it’s crucial to read through the program description and include any relevant keywords. You don’t need to “keyword stuff,” but rather naturally incorporate key requirements, tools, skills, and experience.\nFormatting: Ensure the format of your CV is easily readable so the ATS can parse it. That doesn’t mean you need to submit a no-frills resume, but it does mean you should choose readable fonts, have clear white space, and avoid hard-to-read graphics.\nProofreading: Thoroughly proofread your resume to eliminate any errors or inconsistencies.\n‍\nHow to write a PhD application CV with Teal\nReady to start writing a resume for a PhD application? Teal’s AI Resume Builder can help you create each PhD resume section in seconds—and ensure that what you include is tailored to the program and optimized for ATS.

But recently, Word resumes have gained more popularity, sparking plenty of passionate debates and strong opinions. It begs the question: Should you submit your resume as a PDF or Word document?\n\nThe stakes feel high. Get your resume format wrong and you risk jumbled formatting or, even worse, a document that’s completely inaccessible and illegible.\n\nThat’s why there’s no shortage of hot takes on resume format. However, there are also plenty of myths about resume file formats that are due for some busting (yes, an applicant tracking system can scan a PDF format). Case in point, this recent DM from a misinformed job seeker to a Teal employee:\n\nShould you send your resume as PDF or Word doc?\nIf you're struggling to know whether to send your resume as a PDF or Word doc, this guide breaks down what to consider when choosing between the two options.\n\n‍\n\nNot sure which format to choose? Use Teal to make a free resume that's ATS-friendly and easily export it today.\n\n‍\n\nUnderstanding resume formats: PDF vs. Word\nIt’s easier to make a more informed choice about your resume file format if you understand a little about each of the most common file types: PDF documents and Word documents.\n\nAn overview of PDFs\nPDF is an abbreviation that stands for portable document format. This format was developed by Adobe to ensure documents are displayed consistently across a variety of platforms and devices.\n\nThat’s one of the biggest benefits of PDFs: they preserve the layout and formatting of a document, regardless of the different devices, software, or operating systems used to view them. While it’s possible to create an editable PDF file, most PDF documents are read-only—meaning the content is locked so people can view the document but not edit it directly. \n\nAn overview of Word documents\nA Microsoft Word document (colloquially referred to as a “Word doc”) is a file type created using Microsoft Word. It’s saved as either a .doc or .docx file and it’s not as static as a PDF. Formatting of Word documents can vary depending on the device or version of the software the recipient is using, causing the text and images to move around the page.\n\nUnlike PDF format, Word documents are typically meant to be shared and edited. That means they’re not read-only by default and viewers can edit the document directly. However, converting files within Microsoft Word is simple, so you can easily export your resume created in Word as a PDF.\n\nComparing PDFs and Word documents\nWord documents and PDF files share similarities, but there are also distinct differences in terms of their edibility and security. Here’s a quick comparison of the two:\n\nShould you save resume as a PDF or word doc?\nPros and cons of using PDF for resumes\n\nNow for the big question: What’s the best file format for your resume? \n\nThe short answer is that, in most cases, you should default to a PDF version of your resume. However, it’s also worth checking the job description for any specific instructions about what file type you should choose before you upload your resume. You should be reviewing the job posting carefully anyway as you tailor your resume. \n\nIf you don’t see anything mentioned, here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons of each type to help you make an informed decision.\n\nAdvantages of PDF resume\nWhen thinking about file types, PDFs are the best resume format for a few reasons: \n\nFormatting integrity: The original formatting and layout of your resume are preserved and appear consistent across all different devices and platforms, cutting down on pesky formatting issues that make the wrong impression.\nProfessional appearance: A PDF resume looks more polished and final, as your formatting will stay consistent. Plus, the document won’t show the red squiggly lines that show up in Word resumes to call out errors or misspellings (and frustratingly, those often appear on correct words and phrases because Word doesn’t recognize a lot of industry acronyms or proper nouns).\nATS compatibility: One of the biggest myths about PDF resumes is that ATS software can’t read them. While applicant tracking systems can’t read images (which you shouldn’t include on your resume), most modern ATS have no problem scanning the text content of a PDF.\nAccessibility: Your resume can be opened using various software applications and operating systems, ensuring it’s accessible to the hiring manager, regardless of what device or software they’re using.\nSecurity: Because it’s read-only, your document won’t be edited (whether accidentally or intentionally) by any hiring managers. You can also password-protect or encrypt a PDF file for extra security if needed. \nDisadvantages of PDF resume\nThat said, there are a few drawbacks to sending a PDF version of your resume:\n\nFile size: PDFs are usually larger files than Word documents, which can be a problem if there’s a limit to the file size you can upload with a job application.\nEditability: If you only have a PDF version of your resume, it can be challenging to revisit and edit that file yourself (unless you also saved the Word document or Google Docs version to return to). \nPro Tip: To get around the editing drawbacks of PDF, you can import your PDF resume into Teal’s Resume Builder, edit it there, and save different versions.\n\nUpdate Your PDF Resume with Teal\nPros and cons of using Word for resumes\nWhile a PDF format usually reigns supreme in this resume debate, it’s smart to do your due diligence and also consider the perks and pitfalls of saving your resume in a Word format. \n\nAdvantages of Word resume\nEditability and collaboration: You don’t want a hiring manager to be able to edit your document. But, if you’re submitting your resume to a trusted friend or career coach for help and feedback, a Word document is easier for them to edit. They can add suggestions to your resume directly and collaborate with you on your content.\nFile size: If there’s a limit on the file size you can use, a document in Word format is generally smaller than a PDF. Alternatively, you can always condense the file size of a PDF resume if needed.\nDisadvantages of Word resume\nFormatting: Word docs are prone to formatting discrepancies when opened on different devices and software, which can make your resume look sloppy or even illegible.\nCompatibility: For someone to open a Word file format, they need to either open it directly within Microsoft Word (and not everybody has that program) or import it into Google Drive. But, doing so can cause even more problems with the layout and formatting.\nVersion control: When you make a few small tweaks to your resume but accidentally hit “Save” rather than “Save As” you override the content of your previous document. Keeping track of different versions of your resume is tricky with Word—you either lose past ones or end up with dozens of different files. \nPro Tip: Teal’s Resume Builder can help you easily manage all of the different versions of your resume and then export a PDF with the click of a button.\n\nUpdate Your Word Resume with Teal\nIf you have your sights set on using Word, check out these Microsoft Word templates to navigate around the limitations and pull together a polished and professional document. \n\nSatisfying the robots: The role of ATS in resume screening\nYou might’ve heard about applicant tracking systems (ATS) before. They’re usually positioned as some sort of mysterious and ominous threat to your success while job searching. But dig a little deeper and you’ll realize that this tool isn’t all that sinister.\n\nAn ATS is a type of software hiring teams use to quickly evaluate job applicants. From reporting to sourcing, there’s a lot it can do. However, when job seekers talk about it, they’re usually referring to its resume parsing ability. \n\nResume parsing is how resumes are standardized and sections are separated by an ATS to evaluate candidates. When a resume is submitted, the ATS scans through the document to pull out relevant information the employer is looking for and create a profile for each applicant. Essentially, think of this software as the first filter—it checks each resume and application and selects the ones that meet the criteria specified by the employer. \n\nWith an ATS, actual human recruiters end up with a smaller pile to look through, which is why this software has become increasingly popular. An impressive 70% of large companies use an ATS and 94% of recruiters agree that it’s had a positive impact on hiring processes. \n\nAs an applicant, you want to make it past the ATS and get in front of a real person. That’s why creating an ATS-friendly resume is so important. So, what’s better for most application tracking systems? A PDF or Word resume?\n\nAccording to longtime recruiter and current Director of Recruiting at Teal, Mike Peditto says either format can work, but neither is outright wrong (unless the job application specifies a file type):\n\n\"You can find people who argue both sides of this as the only correct side. It doesn’t matter in almost any system, if it does they will tell you to submit a certain type. That said, PDF is generally safer because formatting won’t get messed up but sometimes Word looks different in different versions.”\n‍In the vast majority of cases, either one will work. While some people claim that PDFs are unreadable by this software, that’s no longer the case—most modern tools have no trouble reading either file type. For that reason, defaulting to a PDF is your best bet to appeal to ATS while also reaping the other benefits of this format. \n\nMaking the right choice: PDF or Word for your resume?\nAt the end of the day, choosing a certain file type shouldn’t be what makes or breaks your job search. As long as it’s legible and your formatting doesn’t become a major mess, your file format won’t be the determining factor in whether your resume lands you in the recycling bin or an interview seat.\n\n\nSign Up for Teal, It's Free\nWhile it’s not the most important factor in your job search, it’s still worth careful consideration. If you’re struggling to make your choice, here are a few other aspects to think through so you can send your resume with confidence:\n\nQuestions to ask to determine with resume file format to submit\nDoes the job post include directions for submitting your resume?\n\nFollow the employer’s instructions for resume file format if specified.\nDo you need someone else to be able to edit your resume?\n\nIf yes, Word. (But consider converting your final version to PDF before submitting to a potential employer.)\nDo you need the formatting to stay consistent?\n\nIf yes, PDF\nDo you need your document to be ATS-friendly? \n\nIf your answer is yes: PDF or Word\nCreate your best resume with Teal’s Resume Builder\nIf you’re still stressing over resume formats, Teal’s Resume Builder can ease your worries with options to easily convert your Word resume, PDF resume, or even LinkedIn profile.\n\nSee how well your resume matches a job description by attaching a saved job and then making strategic changes to boost your chances of getting past ATS.

(And what's not lying)\nLying on a resume is providing false information about your education, experience, skills, or other qualifications.\nIt can range from outright fabrications, like claiming a degree you never earned, to subtle exaggerations, like inflating job titles or quantifiable resume metrics.\nUnderstanding what constitutes a lie is crucial for maintaining your integrity.\n‍\nWhat's considered a lie on a resume?\nLies on a resume can take many forms, so what constitutes lying?\nFalsifying education: Claiming degrees or certifications you never earned.\nInflating job titles: Adding \"senior\" or \"lead\" to your job titles when those weren't your official positions.\nExaggerated accomplishments: Exaggerating metrics or results in your resume bullets, like stating you increased sales by 70 percent when it was only 10 percent.\nCreating bogus work experience: Listing jobs or companies you never worked for.\nMisrepresenting dates: Significantly altering the dates of employment to hide gaps or make your job history appear more stable.\nAdding inaccurate skills: Including proficiencies you don't actually possess, like fluency in a foreign language or expertise in a specific software.\nIncluding fake references: While references don't belong on your resume, once requested, providing the hiring manager fake contacts or having friends pose as past employers.\n‍\nIs lying on a resume fraud?\nFraud is intentional deception for personal gain. When you lie on a resume, you misrepresent your qualifications to get a job, which constitutes a form of fraud. Resume lies leave you liable if they cause significant financial or reputation harm to the employer.\nExamples of employee fraud can include:\nCosts associated with training\nLost productivity\nPotential damage to the company's reputation\nTo put this in context, an employer could take legal action if they suffer losses due to hiring an unqualified candidate based on fraudulent information.\n‍\nIs it okay to exaggerate on a resume?\nEven small exaggerations can have significant consequences.\nExaggerating your responsibilities, skills, or achievements might seem like a way to impress potential employers, but it can damage your credibility if discovered.\n‍\nIs it okay to stretch the truth on a resume?\nStretching the truth, for example, adding \"director of\" to a job title or increasing your percentage of sales can be risky.\nIt's not that many job seekers don't do it, but honesty is always the best policy. And there are effective ways to highlight your strengths without deception.\n‍\nTeal's Director of Talent, Mike Peditto, has this to say:\n\"There are some common resume lies or exaggerations you can probably get away with. Something like embellishing metrics or sales numbers is unlikely to be verified (assuming you are using reasonable numbers). Changing job titles to a more standard title is also unlikely to matter.\n\nTwo areas that are very high risk to lie about are work experience and educational background.\n\nWhile there will always be anecdotes of people who did this and were never caught, the majority of companies—especially large companies—run checks that include degree verification and the dates you worked for companies. A slight difference in months can be chalked up to a mistake, but large discrepancies or making up jobs could potentially cost you an offer during the background check process.\"\n‍\nCan you omit a past job from your resume?\nOmitting a job from your resume isn't necessarily lying, especially if the position was short-term or unrelated to your current career goals (as long as the role you're applying for doesn't require specific clearance).\nThe key is to be honest about the employment dates of the jobs you do list and be prepared to explain a resume gap honestly during interviews. It also means not being deceptive about fake or \"out-of-business\" companies to pad your experience.\nAny attempt to deceive by creating a false employment history with non-existent companies will likely be uncovered.\n‍\nPeditto warns that fudging employment dates will likely come back to bite you in the background check:\n\"Third-party companies run checks and will try to find the information about past employment, including asking for W2s or paystubs to verify employers if they're no longer able to get ahold of a company. Making up a bunch of out-of-business corporations is not the workaround people sometimes claim it is.\"\n‍\nWhat happens if you lie on your resume?\nLying on your resume can lead to professional and legal consequences. Understanding these risks can help you decide how honestly to present your qualifications.\n‍\nIs lying on a resume a crime?\nWhile lying on a resume isn't illegal in itself, it can lead to legal trouble if it harms the employer. Again, it comes back to the difference between a subtle exaggeration and a deliberate misrepresentation that can potentially cause harm.\nFor example, if you secure a job based on false qualifications and your incompetence causes financial loss, you could be sued for damages. In severe cases—like falsifying official documents or committing identity fraud—legal action can result in criminal charges.\n‍\nProfessional consequences of resume deception\nThe pitfalls of resume lying go beyond legal issues.\nBeing caught lying can severely damage your professional reputation, leading to the loss of a job offer or termination. It can also make it difficult to secure future employment.\nEmployers value integrity, and a single instance of dishonesty can overshadow your entire career.\nLying on your resume also raises ethical concerns. It undermines trust between employers and employees and sets a negative precedent for professional conduct. Building a career on honesty and integrity is the right thing to do and creates a solid foundation for long-term success.\nBuild An Authentic Resume Now\n‍\nShould you lie on your resume?\nCan you lie on your resume? Yes. Do people lie on their resumes? Absolutely. Should you lie on your resume? No.\nThink of it this way: emphasizing your strengths is the green area, exaggerating is yellow, and outright lying is red. Avoiding one of the biggest resume mistakes by staying in the green ensures you present yourself accurately and professionally.\n‍\nThe value of accuracy and authenticity\nAccuracy and authenticity on your resume build trust with potential employers. They demonstrate your integrity and willingness to be transparent about your qualifications. Employers appreciate candidates who are honest about their strengths and weaknesses because it shows a commitment to personal and professional growth.\n‍\nHow employers verify information\nEmployers have several methods for verifying the information and work history on your resume.\nAccording to a Society for Human Resources Management survey, 92 percent of employers conduct background screening.\nHiring managers use background checks to confirm your education, previous employment, and other details. Falsifying this information can easily be uncovered during these checks, leading to immediate disqualification from the hiring process.\n‍\nHow to highlight professional qualifications without lying\nEmphasizing your real strengths and achievements is ethical and more sustainable in the long run. You want the job. But you also want to be successful in the role once you get the job.\nA good resume is not only honest but also incorporates relevant keywords and quantifiable metrics, making it both compelling and effective in showcasing your true qualifications.\nHere are some tips to help you create a resume based on your actual experience without resorting to dishonesty. (And how you can do this all in the Teal Resume Builder.)\n‍\nWrite good resume bullets\nCrafting impactful resume bullets involves highlighting your real accomplishments in a way that resonates with potential employers.\n‍\n1. Use quantifiable metrics: Almost every job responsibility can be tied back to numbers. Did you stock shelves? How many? How often? Did you write content? What was the impact of that content on traffic and conversions?\nFocus on quantifiable resume bullets that highlight your previous impact and use metrics to provide concrete evidence of your contributions.\n‍\nFor example, “Implemented a data-driven marketing strategy that increased email open rates by 25%, resulting in a 15% boost in product activation and a 10% increase in overall revenue.”\n‍\n2. Incorporate action verbs: Start resume bullet points with strong resume action verbs to demonstrate your achievements and impact clearly.\nWords like \"managed,\" \"developed,\" \"implemented,\" and \"achieved\" are powerful and convey action and results.\n‍\n3. Add context and results: Provide context for your achievements and explain the results.\n‍\nFor example, \"Developed a new marketing strategy based on canceled subscriber behavior that decreased churn by 9% over six months.\"\n‍\nNot sure where to start? Teal's AI Bullet Point Generator pulls details from your experience and any job description to write relevant, metric-driven bullets with the click of a button.\nWrite Resume Bullet Points With AI\n‍\n‍\nTailor your resume to job descriptions\nTailoring your resume to a specific job involves aligning your skills and experiences with the job description.\nUsing the same keywords and phrases found in the job posting to demonstrate how your qualifications meet the employer's needs.\n‍\nHere's how you can do this:\n1. Analyze job descriptions: Carefully read job descriptions to identify the key skills and qualifications required. Highlight these keywords and ensure they are prominently featured in your resume.\n2. Match your experience: Relate your past experiences directly to the job you are applying for. Show how your previous roles have prepared you for this new opportunity.\n3. Customize your resume sections: Tailor your resume sections (like Professional Summary, Skills, and Work Experience) to reflect the specific job requirements. Focus only on relevant qualifications that make you a strong candidate for the role.\n‍\nIf you want to skip the steps, Teal's Match Scoring and Job Description Keyword Finder can help you tailor your resume to any role—quickly.\nUse Teal's Resume Job Description Match tool to see how your resume content stacks up against a job description.

LinkedIn also understands the importance of skills and allows you to list them on your profile.\n\n‍\n\nWhat is a LinkedIn Skill?\nA LinkedIn Skill is a one-to-three word capability such as “leadership skills,” “problem-solving,” or “SEO.” A LinkedIn Skill section is a key area of your profile where you list your professional expertise—placing a spotlight on your core strengths. You can add up to 100 skills to your profile.\n\n‍\n\n\nTop 10 LinkedIn Skills of 2024.\n‍\n\nHow LinkedIn Skills enhance your job search\nAdding skills to your profile can help make your job search easier. When you search for jobs on LinkedIn, the platform will show you job posts based on your profile and search history. \n\nIn addition, when you open a specific job post you’re interested in, LinkedIn uses your skills to let you know if you’re a good fit for the job.\n\n\nLinkedIn job posts show matching skills based on your profile.\nIn the example above, LinkedIn shows the profile fits eight out of the 10 skills. LinkedIn pulls the best skills needed for the job from the job posting and matches it to the right skills listed on your profile. \n\n‍\n\nLinkedIn Skills enhance your professional profile\nWhen recruiters search for candidates to fill an open role, they prioritize the following factors: \n\nJob title\nLocation\nKey skills\n\nRecruiter’s view of a search for candidates with SEO-related skills.\n‍\n\nThis search will pick up keywords from your profile such as your headline, About section, Experience section, and Skills section. \n\n‍\n\n\nA recruiter’s view of a possible candidate with various keywords marked in bold and an SEO Skills Match. \n‍\n\nIn other words, adding skills in multiple places within your LinkedIn profile can increase your chances of being found by a recruiter and passing an initial screening.\n\nHere’s a great way to check your LinkedIn profile: Download Teal’s Free Chrome Extension which includes an automated LinkedIn Review.

When you open your skill section,  LinkedIn provides suggestions based on your profile.\n\n\nLinkedIn offers skills suggestions based off your profile.\n‍\n\nIn addition, here are some expert tips to help you identify your skills to add to your LinkedIn profile.\n\n“If it's for a technical role, I would look into previous experiences and look at more technical skills—data, analysis, key projects etc. If it's more of a leadership/managerial role, I look for communication skills, previous management experience and if there are any mentions of the team size handled.” – Catherine Quiambao, Marketing Manager, Eaton Square\n“Aside from the obvious alignment to the role, I look for clarity: is there a clear ‘this is what they do’ narrative? Many of the hard skills can be taught, this is more important.” – Tiffany Lyman Otten, Director of B2B Strategy, Power Digital Marketing\n“Leadership and Communications skills are always very valuable and sought after, along with Teamwork. Hard skills can be learned or trained, but soft skills? You need at least some predisposition!” – Juan Carlos Ruz Morales, Senior Talent Attraction Manager, Mytheresa \n‍\n\nLinkedIn Skills examples by type\nHere’s a quick overview of LinkedIn skills organized by profession and skill type.

These will appear in both your About and Skills sections.\n\n\nAdd up to five top skills to your LinkedIn About section.\n‍\n\nFrom your LinkedIn profile, go to your About section.\nSelect the pencil icon. \nUnder Skills, choose Add skill. \nType in your skill or choose from the “Suggested based on your profile” skill.\nRepeat steps four and five until you've added all five top skills, and save.\n‍\n\n\nChoose from suggested LinkedIn Skills or write your own.\n‍\n\nHow to update Skills on LinkedIn\nAs your career progresses, you may find your skill set growing—some skills become more important for your role than others. Alternatively, you may find some skills you’ve added to your profile just aren’t very relevant or valuable anymore. Keep your Skills section updated regularly to reflect your knowledge.\n\nFor all the steps below, first head to your Skills section on your LinkedIn profile.\n\n‍\n\nHow to edit skills on LinkedIn\nSelect the pencil icon next to the skill you want to edit.\nSelect where to attach the skill (Experience, Education, Licenses & certifications, etc.).\nSelect the box next to where you want to attach the skill (such as a specific role or certain certification).\nSave.\n‍\n\nHow to delete skills on LinkedIn\nSelect the pencil icon next to the skill you want to delete.\nNavigate to Delete skill in the bottom left corner.\nHit Delete.\nSave.\n\nSelect \"Delete skill\" in the bottom left to remove a skill.\n‍\n\nHow to reorder skills on LinkedIn\nSelect the three dots at the top right corner. \nChoose \"Reorder\" from the dropdown menu.\nClick the four stacked lines next to the skill you want to reorder. \nContinue holding as you drag the skill up or down. \nRepeat until all skills are in your preferred order. Remember to put your most coveted skills first.\n‍\n\n\nDrop and drop to reorder your LinkedIn Skills.\n‍\n\nHow to endorse skills on LinkedIn\nPeople you are connected to on LinkedIn can endorse your skills and vice versa. You may occasionally be asked to endorse someone’s skills. You can choose to switch on or off endorsements from your own profile. Your options are the following:\n\n“I want to be endorsed” (Turning off your endorsement setting means LinkedIn won’t suggest you or ask your connections to endorse you).\n“Include me in endorsement suggestions to my connections”\n“Show me suggestions to endorse my connections”\n‍\n\nTo endorse a connection's skill from their profile:\n\nNavigate to the profile of the connection.\nScroll down to the Skills & endorsements section and locate the name of the skill you'd like to endorse.\nEndorse.\n\nYour name and profile picture will appear next to an endorsed skill.\n‍\n\nHow to import LinkedIn Skills to your resume\nJust like on LinkedIn, a well-crafted resume “Skills” section tailored to the specific requirements of the job is more effective than listing all your capabilities. \n\nGather all your skills.

However, many customers express frustration with the platform's lack of pricing transparency and generic AI suggestions. On the other hand, Teal's AI Resume Builder offers transparent, flexible pricing and tailored AI suggestions for every unique job.\nOnline resume builders promise to revolutionize your job search. JobHero is one such tool, claiming to simplify the process with its AI-powered tools and industry-specific templates.\nBut does JobHero actually simplify resume creation? This review examines its offerings—and how well it delivers on its promises.\n‍\nWant to skip generic suggestions and pre-written phrases? Try Teal’s AI Resume Builder for tailored, keyword-focused resumes that match the jobs you're applying for.\n‍\nWhat is JobHero?\nJobHero is an AI resume builder that aims to simplify the resume creation process. With its clean and easy-to-navigate website, JobHero offers a range of professional templates for different industries and job roles.\n‍\n‍\nThe platform gets you started with resume template choices and then walks you through several guided questions to fill in your resume. It offers customization options and personalization choices along the way. JobHero also provides keyword suggestions based on industry and recruiter data, helping you optimize your resume to stand out. One of its notable features is the ability to search for a template based on job title.\nJobHero's customizable resume and cover letter builders guide users with questions throughout the process. The platform boasts a 4.3 rating on Trustpilot with several hundred positive reviews, which seems promising at first glance.\n‍\nJobHero key features\nWhile these features appear appealing, it's worth examining JobHero's offerings more closely. Let's take a detailed look at its capabilities, user experiences, and potential limitations to give you a clear picture of what this tool actually provides.\n‍\nBefore you rush to sign up for JobHero, let's take a closer look at what it actually offers. Here are the core features:\nProfessional templates: A collection of 30 pre-built templates categorized by industry and job type.\nAI resume writer: An AI tool that guides you through your resume creation by asking questions about your career and work history.\nCover letter builder: A tool to help you create cover letters using preformatted templates.\n‍\nJob Hero reviews by site\nMost JobHero customers are satisfied with their easy-to-use interface and quick resume design process. They also feel the pricing is reasonable. However, some users complain about pricing surprises, generic AI suggestions, and vague templates.\n‍\nJob Hero reviews on TrustPilot\n4.3 / 5 star\nMost users who reviewed JobHero on TrustPilot appreciate the overall ease of use and resume template designs tailored to job titles. However, some reviewers commented those templates are outdated and don’t contain much relevant information. Some of the expert recommendations also didn’t meet expectations. ‍\nJob Hero Reviews on Site Jabber\n4.6 / 5 star\nJobHero has nearly 15,000 reviews on Site Jabber—far more than on TrustPilot. This gives a larger scope of the ups and downs of the platform.\nOverall, customers really like how simple it is to get started and how fast they can create a professional resume (30 minutes is commonly stated). It’s also easy to use and affordable for most job seekers. \nOn the downside, customers have complained about the customization options and payment plans. Many customers believe the platform to be free, go through the process of constructing a professional resume, and hit a paywall when they’re ready to download it.  \n‍\nInformal JobHero resume builder reviews by social media platform\nJob hero reviews on Reddit\nThere are no specific threads on Reddit reviewing JobHero, but there are a few threads on job boards and resume help that mention JobHero.\nThe mentions are primarily positive, though they do note they’ve had to do some homework to find the “action words” for their prospective position.‍\nJobHero resume builder review\nOverall, users like that JobHero's resume builder is rather simple. They’re able to get started and finish creating at least one resume in just minutes. JobHero’s platform walks customers through the process, asking questions about their career and work history along the way. JobHero's AI tool helps fill in gaps and suggests ways to optimize the resume.\n‍\nSome of the details AI requests:\nHow long have you been working?\nWhat is your most recent job?\nWhat best describes your level of education?\nWhat skills would you like to highlight?\nTell us about your background\nDo you have anything else to add?\n‍\nBut things get a little interesting around that last question. Once you’ve reached it, the platform offers you to search job titles to find pre-written examples. After you type in a search, it’ll generate the results and automatically ask you if you’d like to add those skills to your resume. \nYou don’t have a chance to fully review them unless you want to click off the pop-up to review the skills. Additionally, the skills they list aren’t very comprehensive. In fact, they’re a bit generic to the role. \n‍‍\nAfter typing “marketing” into the job search description, the skills results were:\nMarketing promotions\nIntegrated marketing campaign development\nPromotions and marketing strategies\nLocal marketing initiatives\n‍\nThe next section is similar, offering rather generic summaries for the position. This could be because “marketing” itself is a rather generic entry. But, even after trying a more specific job title, “Content marketing manager,” the suggestions still require more detail than what's being provided. \n‍\n‍\nOne understated feature is the ability to select and compare three resume templates. ‍\nHowever, this feature falls short of expectations. After selecting three templates to compare, you're prompted to fill in your resume details. But, once completed, only one resume is displayed. While you can switch between templates using a side panel, it raises questions about the purpose of selecting three templates at the start.\n‍\n‍\nJobHero offers a user-friendly experience with an intuitive interface and clear questions. However, many users find the AI suggestions too generic, lacking the specificity needed for their industry or profession. A common complaint is the unexpected paywall: users are expecting a free resume builder but must complete the entire resume creation process before learning they need to pay to download their work.\n‍\nJobHero cover letter review\nJobHero customers carry the same perception of the cover letter builder as they do the resume builder—easy to use and quick to generate.\nHowever, some customers have complained about the generic text generated. It appears JobHero’s AI isn’t complex enough to generate summaries for more seasoned workers and niche industries or jobs. Customers also complained about a lack of customization options for cover letters. ‍\nJobHero pricing review\nJobHero offers a 14-day trial for $2.95, and if you opt to keep your subscription after that, it's $24.95/month. Most reviewers feel this is reasonable, especially if you create multiple resumes within the trial period. \nHowever, it’s easy to forget that the monthly charge is coming, and some customers have struggled to reclaim their money. This problem is only aggravated by the fact that they don’t include pricing on their website until you’ve already created your account and are ready to download your first resume. \n‍\nJobHero review pros\nBased on user's positive feedback, customers are most satisfied with the following:\nEase of use: JobHero is certainly easy to use, as the platform walks you through each step of filling out both your resume and cover letter.\nTemplate collection: JobHero offers a collection of over thirty resume templates and more than fifteen cover letter templates.\nExamples: Aside from the templates, JobHero also offers cover letter and resume examples. You’ll find over 1000 completed resume samples and over 70 cover letter examples. \nAffordability: Most users feel that the $2.95 two-week trial is fair and are comfortable with the monthly subscription as long as they use the service. \n‍\nJobHero review cons\nDespite the positives, there are several negatives to using JobHero as well:\nPricing surprises: While many customers feel the pricing is fair and affordable, there are quite a few complaints that they’re unaware of the pricing until they’ve gone through the entire process of creating a resume. Others have stated they have a hard time getting refunds on these surprise fees.\nWeak suggestions: JobHero’s resume builder uses AI to help you fill out resume templates. However, some users don’t feel those suggestions are specific enough to their industry or prospective employer. \nToo generic: Aside from the suggestions being rather weak for specific roles, some users feel their industry-specified templates are too generic to actually use without extensive alterations. \n‍\nBest for\nJobHero is best for students and young professionals just entering the job market, either for the first time or early in their careers.\nWith so many of the templates being generic and far less detailed, it’s unlikely they’ll be suitable for employees with more extensive experience (unless you make considerable edits).\n‍\nWhy Job Seekers Prefer Teal\nThe key difference between Teal and JobHero is that Teal is a complete end-to-end solution. From searching for job openings to emailing the hiring manager, Teal offers job search tools, job listing saving and tracking, and more. \n‍\nFlexible pricing\nWhile many users of JobHero dislike the lack of transparency on pricing, Teal is the opposite.

Teal+ carries the remaining 10% of features that you can cancel or downgrade at any time. \nEven better, you can pay at your pace– weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly.\n\nCustomer success story: How Oshen Turned 55% of Applications Into Interviews Using Teal\n‍\nCustomizable AI for your resume and cover letter\nTeal's AI tools go beyond generic suggestions.

Which responsibilities you choose to showcase and how you chose to include them on your resume can make the difference in whether you move forward in the hiring process.\n\nProperly communicating job responsibilities is equally important for job seekers as it is for companies. To craft an effective job description, an employer needs to accurately and concisely convey a role’s job requirements. Conversely, job seekers need to tailor their resumes to show how their current job responsibilities align with the current opportunity.\n\nAs a result, you should consider the impact of job responsibilities from two perspectives: the employer and the job seeker.\n\n‍\n\nHow to list job responsibilities on your resume as a job seeker\nA resume should showcase your proven track record and potential. To elevate the descriptions of key responsibilities you’ve held in the past, try this success formula:\n\nAction Verb + Task + Metric + [Strategy Optional] = Outcome \n\nFor example, \"Led a marketing team (action verb + task) to increase online engagement by 40% (metric) through a targeted social media campaign (strategy), resulting in a 15% increase in sales (outcome).\"\n\n‍\n\nHere are some tips for writing effective job descriptions for your resume:\n\nQuantify bullet points\nWherever possible, use numbers and data to quantify your resume. Including concrete numbers legitimizes your ability to carry out the roles and responsibilities assumed by your title and outlined in the job description in question.\n\n‍\n\nMirror the job description\nExamine the job listing closely and align your resume to it. Use similar language and emphasize related resume work experience most relevant to the new role.\n\n‍\n\nHighlight relevant skills\nDemonstrate how your skills directly correlate with the job duties listed. Make it easy for hiring managers to see you as the ideal candidate.\n\n‍\n\nCustomize your resume\nNo two job applications are the same. Tailor your resume for each job you apply to, focusing on how your background fits with each specific role.\n\nFor job seekers, a tailored resume that speaks to these key responsibilities can set you apart. For employers, clear and detailed job descriptions are your first step in attracting the right talent. \n\nUse these strategies to enhance your hiring processes or to refine your approach to applying for new roles.\n\n‍\n\nA case study bar describing how one Teal user increased their interviews using AI to write job responsibilities examples\n‍\n\nHow to use AI to write job responsibilities\nLeveraging AI, Teal's AI Resume Bullet Point Generator helps transform work experiences into quantifiable achievements.

Ensure job postings are current and reflect the role accurately.\n\nIf the role of a sales representative now includes responsibilities in digital marketing, the job description should be updated to reflect this change. \n\nExample\n\n❌ Mention traditional sales techniques.\n\n✅ Include digital marketing skills like “social media management” and “lead generation through online channels.”\n\nRemember, this is dependent on the role and how that role is outlined in the job description. \n\n‍\n\nIncorporate keywords\nUse industry-specific keywords and phrases. This not only helps attract the right candidates but also makes the job posting more searchable online.\n\nExample\n\n❌ When hiring for a software engineer, you fail to list languages required.\n\n✅ Include keywords like \"Java,\" \"Python,\" or \"agile development\" to appeal to candidates with relevant skills and experience. \n\nThis will also help the job posting appear in search results when candidates search for these specific keywords. Teal’s AI Resume Builder helps you with this by analyzing the job description and incorporating the right words throughout your resume.\n\n‍\n\nInclude expectations\nBeyond specific tasks, outline expected outcomes and performance metrics. This gives potential applicants a clear idea of how success is measured in the role.\n\nExample\n\n❌ Only listing tasks for a customer service representative\n\n✅ Include expectations like \"Achieve customer satisfaction ratings of 90% or higher\" or \"Respond to customer inquiries within 24 hours.\" \n\nThese metrics give applicants a clear understanding of the performance standards and expectations for the role.\n\n‍\n\nBad job responsibilities example for job description\nJob Title: Sales Manager\n\nManage the sales team\nOversee the sales process\nWork with various teams\nEnsure customer satisfaction\nMeet sales targets\n‍\n\nGood job responsibilities example for job description\nJob Title: Sales Manager\n\nLead and mentor a team of 12 sales representatives to hit quarterly team sales goals through individual coaching sessions and weekly team meetings\nStreamline the sales process by implementing a new CRM system by Q3 2023, with the goal of reducing sales cycle time by 20%\nCollaborate with Marketing, Product Development, and Customer Service teams to ensure alignment, aiming for a 15% year-over-year increase in customer retention\nActively monitor customer satisfaction metrics using Net Promoter Score (NPS) and implement data-driven strategies to improve scores by at least 10 points within the next fiscal year\nIn these job responsibilities examples, roles are clarified with specific goals, day-to-day tasks,  metrics for success, and time frames. That level of specificity gives candidates a better idea of what success looks like for the role, helping them qualify themselves in or out to save both parties valuable time.\n\n‍\n\nJob responsibilities examples by role\n1.

Similar to skills, qualifications are tangible.\nIf you’re a candidate just entering the job market or a recruiter writing your first job posting, however, you may need help deciphering what job qualifications are and what they look like in written form.\nThis guide will help you better understand job qualifications—what makes them different from skills, the different types of job qualifications, and how to list them on a resume.\nStruggling to showcase job qualifications on your resume? Build a resume the right way with Teal.\n‍\nUnderstanding job qualifications\nA critical element in any job description, job qualifications are the skills, education, or experience required for a job position. They’re what ensure an individual can be successful in a role.\nQualifications for a job depend widely based on the specific role and industry. Formal qualifications such as degrees and licenses in fields like medicine, law, engineering, and education are often mandatory. \nLarge corporations are similarly strict with job requirements. Carefully assess the requirements of a role to see how well you match the desired skills, experiences, and accomplishments.\n‍\nWhat is the difference between skills and qualifications\nWhile similar to skills and core competencies, qualifications differ from both. Skills are specific abilities you possess which make you valuable at your job. \nSkills are categorized into two types: hard or technical skills and soft skills. Many hard and technical skills, such as licenses and application knowledge, overlap with qualifications. \nYou’ll list both your qualifications and your hard skills on your resume.\n\n‍\nWhat is the difference between eligibility and qualifications?\nWhile the terms may sometimes be interchangeable, there is a key difference between eligibility and qualification. Eligibility refers to the basic criteria a candidate must meet to be considered for a job. \nEligibility can refer to being part of a specific group of people the company wants to hire, such as a current federal employee, a veteran, or a student. It can also refer to legal requirements. \nFor example, a minimum age requirement and work authorization.\nCommon eligibility examples\nMust be 18 or older\nEligible to work in the US\nIn many cases, your work experience, skills, and other qualifications do not factor into your eligibility.\n\n‍\nTypes of job qualifications in the hiring process\nYou won’t run into every type of job qualification, but it’s good to know what could help—or hurt—your chances at landing a role.\nHere is an overview of different qualification types you may see in a job posting: \nEducational qualifications\nDegrees and diplomas: Academic credentials are very common qualifiers. These credentials could be a high school diploma, bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, or doctorate. \nRelevant coursework: Similar to the above point, some employers may require specific courses, classes, or training programs pertinent to the job.\nProfessional qualifications\nProfessional certifications: Credentials obtained through standard assessments and recognized by professional bodies, such as a CPA (Certified Public Accountant).\nLicenses: Official permissions mandatory to practice in certain fields, such as a medical license.\nHard skills: The abilities often gained through training, such as SEO knowledge or understanding of cryptography.\nOther qualifications\nPhysical ability: If it’s an essential part of certain tasks, physical abilities may be listed as a qualification. For example, a job may require you to pick up boxes weighing up to 40 pounds. \nLanguage ability: The ability to speak a language outside of your native language, such as proficiency in Spanish and English.\n‍\n11 examples of job qualifications\nWhether you’re wondering what you may need to apply to a role or you are a recruiter creating job postings, the below examples provide a brief overview of qualifications for common roles.\nData analyst qualifications\nBachelor’s degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, or similar \nCertified Analytics Professional (CAP)\nMicrosoft Certified: Data Analyst Associate\nGoogle Data Analytics Professional Certificate\nPython or SQL\nAdvanced in Microsoft Excel\nQuality assurance qualifications\nBachelor’s degree in Quality Assurance, Engineering, Computer Science, or similar\nQA tools such as Selenium, JIRA, and LoadRunner\nMember of relevant professional organizations such as ASQ or ISTQB\nBookkeeper qualifications\nDegree in Accounting, Finance, Business Administration, or similar\nCertified Bookkeeper (CB)\nQuickBooks or Xero\nStrong ethical standards\nCyber security qualifications\nBachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity, Computer Science, Information Technology, or similar\nKnowledge in operating systems (Windows, Linux, Unix)\nCertifications such as CISSP, CEH, CompTIA Security+, CISM\nProficiency in network security (firewalls, VPNs, and IDS/IPS)\nCopywriter qualifications\nA bachelor’s degree in English, Journalism, Marketing, Communications, or a similar\nExperience working in the same or similar industries can be beneficial\nFamiliarity with content management systems (CMS) like WordPress\nStrong portfolio of writing samples\nAdministrative assistant qualifications\nA high school diploma or equivalent\nCertified Administrative Professional (CAP)\nMicrosoft Office Specialist (MOS)\nProficiency with Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook)\nData entry skills\nAuditor qualifications\nBachelor’s degree in Accounting, Finance, or similar\nCertified Public Accountant (CPA)\nAdditional certifications such as Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)\nProficiency with auditing software such as ACL and IDEA\nExperience with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems such as SAP, Oracle, or QuickBooks\nHR qualifications\nBachelor’s degree in Human Resources, Business Administration, or similar\nMaster’s degree or relevant postgraduate qualification is a plus\nCoursework specific HR areas such as benefits, compensation, or talent management\nAdvanced skills in Microsoft Office, particularly Excel and PowerPoint\nIT qualifications\nBachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Information Technology or similar\nMaster’s degree or relevant postgraduate qualification (at some companies)\nCertifications such as CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+, Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE)\nExperience in managing IT infrastructure, including servers, networks, and databases\nProficiency with operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS)\nExcellent problem-solving and analytical skills\nSales qualifications\nBachelor’s degree in Business, Marketing, or similar\nAdditional certifications or experience in specific industries (e.g., technology, pharmaceuticals) are a plus\nProficiency with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software such as Salesforce\nProven track record of meeting or exceeding sales targets\nExcellent communication and interpersonal skills\nMedical assistant qualifications\nHigh school diploma or equivalent\nGraduation from an accredited medical assistant program is preferred\nBasic Life Support (BLS) certification\nMinimum of 1-2 years of experience working in a clinical setting\nFamiliarity with medical billing and coding practices\n‍\nHow to identify qualifications in job descriptions\nLuckily, job postings clearly state qualifications—so you’ll use that to highlight key qualifications on your resume.\nIn the below example for a senior product manager position, the qualifications are clearly listed in the job description.\n‍\nMatch Your Resume to a Job Description\n‍\n\n\nA great way to see how your qualifications line up with a job is by using Teal’s AI Resume Builder.

That’s why when it comes to conveying your professional journey on paper, you need to get to the point—the bullet point, that is. \n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn everything you need to know for crafting strong bullet points that help your resume rise to the top of the stack.\n\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nUnderstanding resume bullet points\nResume bullet points are concise, descriptive phrases that highlight your achievements, skills, and experiences relevant to the job description. They quickly communicate your value to an employer, breaking down your professional story into digestible, impactful snippets.\n\nMore importantly, good bullet points transform a dense block of text into an easily navigable and readable format.\n\n‍\n\nConsider the following description of a marketing coordinator in a formal paragraph:\n\n“In my role as a Marketing Coordinator, I was responsible for various tasks including social media management, overseeing email campaigns, analyzing data to inform marketing strategies, collaborating with the sales team to align marketing and sales goals, graphic design for promotional materials, and event planning for company-wide functions.”\n\nAnd compare that with the same information in bullet-point form:\n\nOversaw and strategized content for multiple platforms, increasing engagement by 37%.\nLed the creation and distribution of weekly newsletters, achieving an open rate of 25%.\nUsed analytics to refine marketing strategies, enhancing campaign effectiveness by 15%.\nPartnered with the sales team to align marketing efforts with sales goals, boosting lead generation by 21%.\nDeveloped visual content for marketing materials, resulting in a 43% increase in campaign response rate.\nOrchestrated company-wide events, including logistics and vendor management, enhancing team morale and brand awareness.\nInstead of slogging through paragraphs, resume bullet points allow recruiters to immediately grasp the scope of your capabilities and achievements with a quick skim. This clarity is crucial, as an eye-tracking study found hiring managers spend an average of seven seconds on each resume. \n\n‍\n\nWhy bullet points are a “must-have” in your resume\nThe real power of good resume bullet points lies in their ability to make your resume stand out.\n\nWith all the competition you’re facing, distinct resume bullets can be the difference between your resume being noticed or tossed. By clearly outlining your accomplishments and skills, bullet points create a narrative of your professional journey that is both compelling and easy to follow.\n\nFor example, instead of saying \"Responsible for managing a team,\" a stronger bullet point would be \"Led a team of 10, increasing overall productivity by 20%.\" \n\nPlus, bullet points are a prime spot for integrating keywords relevant to the job description. Strategically incorporating keywords helps tailor your resume to the specific role. Ultimately, this makes you more likely to be found by hiring managers searching for those specific skills and qualifications in Application Tracking Systems (ATS).\n\nDid you know? Teal’s AI Resume Builder highlights and extracts keywords from your job description.\n\nresume score\nUse Teal's Matching Mode to tailor your resume to each job description\nOptimize Your Resume with Teal\n‍\n\nHow to write effective bullet points\nWriting effective bullet points instantly communicates your most relevant qualifications to recruiters. \n\nHere’s a guide to ensure each bullet point on your resume is impactful and resonates with potential employers:\n\n‍\n\nStart with strong action verbs\nInitiate each bullet point with a dynamic action verb. Words like “orchestrated”, “spearheaded”, or “implemented” immediately draw the eye and illustrate your active role in your accomplishments.\n\n‍\n\nHere’s how you might transform an otherwise boring sentence into a more engaging one:\n\nBefore: \"Was responsible for leading a team to develop a new marketing strategy.\"\nAfter: \"Spearheaded a team of 10 to innovate a comprehensive marketing strategy, leading to a 15% increase in customer engagement.\"\nWhy This Works: The use of \"Spearheaded\" in place of \"Was responsible for\" portrays a more proactive and leadership-oriented role. This single word conveys not just involvement but direct management and initiative.\n\nFinally, quantifying the achievement with \"a team of 10\" and the result of \"15% increase in customer engagement\" provides concrete evidence of the impact made.\n\nThis approach makes the statement more dynamic and results-focused, which is more likely to capture a hiring manager's attention.\n\n‍\n\nQuantify your achievements\nNumbers speak louder than words. \n\nWherever possible, use statistics and figures to quantify your successes. This not only adds credibility but also allows the reader to understand the extent and impact of your contributions.\n\n‍\n\nBefore: “Increased sales in Q1.”\nAfter: “Increased sales by 30% in Q1”\nWhy this works: The latter is more impressive and informative.\n\n‍\n\nBe concise but specific\nClarity and brevity are key. While it’s important to keep your bullet points succinct, be sure they also provide specific details about your skills and achievements. \n\nAvoid vague statements and focus on conveying clear and precise information about your professional experiences.\n\n‍\n\nHere’s a good and bad example of being concise but specific in resume bullet points: \n\nBefore: \"Worked on improving customer service.\"\nAfter: \"Revamped customer service protocols, achieving a 95% satisfaction rate and reducing average call time by 30%.\"\nWhy This Works: The improved example enhances the clarity and impact of the statement.\n\n\"Revamped customer service protocols\" replaces the vague \"Worked on improving customer service,\" giving a clear indication of a proactive and transformative role. And, again, including quantifiable outcomes – a 95% satisfaction rate and a 30% reduction in average call time – offers concrete evidence of the achievement's impact.\n\nThis works well because it moves beyond generalities to provide specific, measurable details. It demonstrates the candidate's direct contribution to organizational improvement and provides a clear metric of success\n\n‍\n\nTailor them to the job\nCustomize your resume to align with the job description. Incorporate keywords and phrases from the job listing to make your resume more relevant.\n\nThis demonstrates that you have not only read the job description thoroughly but also that your skills and experiences are a direct match.\n\n‍\n\nConsider the following job description, then see how a good and bad example compare:\n\nJob description: XYZ Tech Solutions is seeking a Project Manager with a proven track record of managing cross-departmental projects in a fast-paced environment. The ideal candidate will possess strong coordination skills and experience in working with marketing and engineering teams. The role requires strategic alignment with company objectives, ensuring project timelines are met and resources are effectively utilized.\n\nBefore: \"Managed multiple project timelines and coordinated with various teams.\"\nAfter: \"Efficiently managed 10+ cross-departmental project timelines, ensuring alignment with marketing and engineering teams, in accordance with the company's strategic objectives.\"\nWhy This Works: The revised bullet point effectively tailors to the specific needs of XYZ Tech Solutions by directly mirroring the language and key requirements of the job description.\n\nIt showcases the candidate's relevant experience in managing cross-departmental projects, particularly with marketing and engineering teams, a crucial aspect of the role. Plus, it highlights the candidate's strategic alignment with company objectives, demonstrating a deeper understanding and suitability for the position.\n\n‍\n\nFocus on outcomes\nEmphasize the results and impact of your actions, rather than just listing tasks. This approach showcases your contribution to the organization’s success. \n\nFor example, “Designed a new inventory management system, reducing material waste by 20%” highlights the outcome of your initiative.\n\nBefore: \"Tasked with redesigning the inventory management system.\" \nAfter: \"Redesigned the inventory management system, resulting in a 20% reduction in material waste and significantly improving efficiency.\"\nWhy this works: Highlighting the specific outcome of a 20% reduction in material waste quantifies the achievement, making it more impactful and memorable to potential employers. This approach underscores the candidate's effectiveness and value-add, distinguishing them in a competitive job market.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create bullet points that effectively capture your achievements and skills, making your resume stand out in a competitive job market.\n\n‍\n\nEnter Teal’s Achievement Wizard\nThe Achievement Wizard is a dynamic feature within Teal’s AI Resume Builder, designed to help you transform your work experiences into impressive achievements. It prompts you to think about your roles in terms of measurable impacts, encouraging you to quantify your successes and present them in a way that speaks to your potential future employer.\n\nThen, as you’re writing your bullet points, AI will suggest better ways to phrase each resume bullet. And the best part is that you can still edit all the output to make sure it’s as genuine as it is impactful.\n\n\n‍\n\n‍Pro Tip: To dive deeper into resume bullet best practices, read how many bullet points should I list per job on my resume.\n\n‍\n\nResume bullet point examples\nIn each of the following resume examples, the candidates have effectively used their bullet points to highlight specific, quantifiable achievements that are directly applicable to their roles.\n\nBy doing so, they provide a clear picture of their capabilities and the value they can bring to a potential employer:\n\n‍\n\n1.

Structure and content\nStructuring bullet points is both an art and a science; so let us help you with the science part. \n\nUse this formula to craft engaging bullet points for your resume:\n\nSuccess Verb + Noun + Metric + [Strategy Optional] + Outcome Formula\nStart with a strong action verb to convey your role in the achievement, such as 'orchestrated' to highlight your interpersonal skills, followed by the task or responsibility. Include measurable results to quantify your success and, if applicable, mention the strategy used. \n\nConclude with a positive outcome.\n\nExample\n\"Orchestrated (Success Verb) a comprehensive revamp of customer service protocols (Noun), achieving a 45% enhancement in customer satisfaction ratings (Metric) by integrating user feedback analysis (Strategy Optional), which led to a prestigious industry award for customer service excellence (Outcome).\"\n\n‍\n\n2. Formatting techniques\nUnless you’re applying to a creative role, your resume should have consistent and straightforward formatting. Follow these guidelines to ensure your bullet points are skimmable for hiring managers:\n\nTypeface and font size: Use the same typeface as the rest of your resume to ensure consistency. The font size for bullet points should be slightly smaller than your section headers but still legible, typically around 10 to 12 points.\nLine Spacing: Adequate spacing is key for readability. Keep a balanced line spacing; 1.15 to 1.5 lines is usually best. This resume spacing ensures your bullet points are distinct from each other but still part of a cohesive whole.\nIndentation: Proper indentation sets your bullet points apart from the rest of the text and makes your list more readable. A standard half-inch indent works well. Ensure all bullet points are uniformly indented for a professional look.\nBullet Style: Use simple, classic bullet styles (like circles or squares) rather than fancy or unusual symbols. Consistency in bullet style throughout the document is important.\nIf you’re using Teal’s AI Resume Builder, you don’t have to worry about this. You can quickly change the format of your resume’s bullet points, always ensuring the result looks clean and professional: \n\n‍\n\nSign Up, It's Free\n‍\n\n3. Consistency and clarity\nAs a rule of thumb, each section of your resume should have a consistent format and prioritize the clarity of your message. \n\nHere are some tips to help you stay clear and consistent: \n\nUniformity in tense: Use the same tense throughout your bullet points. For current positions, use present tense; for past roles, use past tense.\nParallel structure: Start each bullet point similarly, preferably with action verbs. This structure creates a rhythm and makes your resume more skimmable.\nBrevity and impact: Each bullet should be concise but impactful. Avoid long, complex sentences. Focus on clear, brief descriptions of your accomplishments.\nTailor it to the job description: Reflect keywords and phrases from the job description in your bullet points. This tailoring helps align your resume with the specific requirements of the job.\nPro Tip: Need help beyond bullet points?

Simply listing your skills isn’t enough. To get an employer’s attention, you need to prove your expertise and knowledge along with results achieved in both your Work Experience and Skills sections.\nThis article covers types of expertise to put on your resume, examples of how to demonstrate expertise on a resume and tips for proving your knowledge and abilities.\nWant to show the right expertise on your resume? Get started with Teal’s AI Resume Builder for free.\n‍\nUnderstanding areas of expertise on a resume\nIn general, areas of expertise refer to the specific skills and knowledge you possess in a particular field. When it comes to resumes, areas of expertise are the knowledge and experience you highlight that make you a perfect fit for certain jobs. While your resume might not have a specific “areas of expertise” section, you can still weave in your skills and knowledge throughout.\nThink of your resume as a sales document. Instead of trying to show you can help with any skill, job title, and industry, you want to tailor your resume and the exact skills and expertise you show off to a specific job posting. You might have plenty of other skills, but you don’t need to include them on every resume.\nTeal’s Matching Mode makes it easy to tailor your resume. After saving a job to your job tracker, simply head to the Resume Builder, click on Matching Mode, choose the job you just saved, and automatically get a list of recommended key skills to add to your resume.\nTailor Your Resume\n‍\n\n‍\nWith high competition in the job market, a generic resume gets lost in the pile. But if you can show exactly why you’re the perfect fit for a role, you’ll attract more interview invites. It helps to craft the narrative around your expertise early as you can expect questions about your skills and experience during interviews.\n‍\nTypes of expertise to highlight on a resume\nIdentifying your areas of expertise can be a challenge. People often downplay their natural strengths and struggle to identify what job-related skills and qualities are most useful.\nYou might even have more than one area of expertise, but you should prioritize showing hard and soft skills in your resume that are highly relevant to a specific job. Focus on what truly sets you apart and what aligns with the jobs you're targeting.\nHere’s what to do if you’re overqualified for a job.\n\n‍\nHard skills\nHard skills are the technical capabilities and specific knowledge you possess that can be learned or acquired through education, training, or experience. They're measurable and quantifiable skills employers actively seek when filling positions.\n‍\nHere are some common hard skill types across different fields:\nTechnical skills: Data analysis, video editing, machine learning, programming\nBusiness skills: Accounting, project management skills, business development\nIndustry-specific skills: Digital marketing, healthcare, law, supply chain management\nTo showcase hard skills on your resume, list them in a Skills section along with weaving them into your Resume Summary and Work Experience sections. If you have a degree related to your profession, your Education section can reinforce your knowledge. Use strong action verbs to write bullet points with quantifiable results whenever possible.\n‍\nExample\nIncreased website traffic by 20% through search engine optimization.\n‍\n‍\nSoft skills\nSoft skills are the character traits, communication abilities, and interpersonal skills that contribute to your success in the workplace. Unlike hard skills, which are technical and teachable, soft skills are more about personality and how you interact with others. They are important for building strong relationships, navigating complex situations, and adapting to new challenges.\n‍\nHere are examples of soft skills relevant to most industries:\nCommunication: Written and verbal communication skills, as well as active listening and the ability to clearly express your ideas.\nTeamwork: The ability to collaborate effectively with others, share ideas, and work toward a common goal.\nProblem-solving: Being able to analyze situations, identify problems, and develop creative solutions is a valuable asset in any role.\nLeadership: Inspiring and motivating others, taking initiative, and delegating tasks effectively.\nInstead of listing soft skills on your resume, use action verbs in your Work Experience section to share situations where you used your soft skills effectively. Soft skills can also be appropriate in a Resume Summary to describe you as a person. \nShow, don't tell, by describing situations where your communication skills shone through, your leadership inspired others, or your strong work ethic got results for your employer.\n‍\nExample\nLed a cross-functional team of 5 developers with effective communication, task delegation, and Agile project management methodologies.\n‍\nTransferable skills\nTransferable skills are abilities you can apply across different jobs and industries. They're not tied to a specific technical expertise but rather focus on the core strengths you develop through experience, education, and personal growth. There is a lot of overlap between soft skills and transferable skills.\n‍\nThese are some examples of transferable skills:\nCritical thinking: The ability to think critically, analyze information objectively, and make sound decisions is essential for strong decision-making in any field. This can also include analytical skills.\nTime management: Effective time management skills allow you to prioritize tasks, meet deadlines, and stay organized.\nAdaptability and flexibility: The ability to adapt to change, learn new things, and be comfortable in a changing environment is becoming increasingly important across all professions.\nProject management: The ability to organize tasks, manage resources, and meet deadlines is valuable in any role, even if it's not your primary responsibility.\nFor job seekers making a career change or pivot, demonstrating transferable skills on your resume is key. First, identify these skills across your professional and personal experiences. Then, tailor your resume to each job, highlighting the transferable skills that directly address the employer's needs through your Skills and Work Experience sections.\n‍\nExample\nA teacher pivoting into project management could write this bullet point on a resume: \nDeveloped and implemented a comprehensive curriculum for a new technology program, outlining learning objectives, creating engaging lesson plans, and establishing assessment methods.\n‍\nPro tip: Teal’s Resume Builder makes it easy to tailor your resume by using Matching Mode and AI to tell you exactly what keywords to add to optimize your resume for a specific job posting.\n‍\n\n‍\nDon't limit yourself to work experience. Relevant volunteer work or extracurriculars can also help prove your expertise.\n‍\nExperience\nBesides skills, a large part of your resume will be dedicated to your experience. This experience may come in the form of professional work experience, projects (especially technical ones), or even volunteer work.\nIn the book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea that it takes ten thousand hours to become a world-class expert in a field after he observed how many years of effort the top musicians, performers, athletes, and engineers had completed.\nWhile you might not be trying to be the next Tiger Woods or Yo-Yo Ma, each job you’ve had within your chosen field has likely contributed to advancing your skills meaningfully. Whether your past jobs were all related to your ideal role or not, try to position your accomplishments in a way that creates a cohesive narrative for a hiring manager.\nFor example, someone could be a professional designer with a love of design and art going back to childhood. They gained experience through school projects, jobs in related fields like marketing and web design, and learning about UI/UX design. All their past jobs and thousands of hours of experience accumulated to eventually give them expertise in the field of design.\nThey’re now seeking a new job as a UX Designer, so they should speak to their history in the field in their resume summary or cover letter. They can use Teal’s AI writing features to help them craft the narrative in a compelling way throughout their job search materials.\n‍\nHow to list areas of expertise on a resume\nRather than creating a separate “Areas of Expertise” section, it’s best to weave your skills and experience throughout your resume.\nFocus on results and strong action verbs. Did you manage a project or spearhead a new undertaking? Quantify your bullet points whenever possible, and highlight relevant transferable skills. Of course, you can also list technical and hard skills in your Skills Section.\nTo build a resume that shows achievement-based bullets and areas of expertise, use Teal’s AI-powered Resume Builder. Here’s how:\n‍\nStep 1\nNavigate to the Resume Builder and click on New Resume. You can use the Professional Summary, Work Experience, Education, and Skills sections to demonstrate your achievements and expertise in your bullets.\nIf you want to further back up your expertise, you can also add Certifications, Awards and Scholarships, Projects, Volunteering and Leadership, Publications, and Interests if appropriate.\n‍\nStep 2\nWhenever possible, try to add metrics and quantifiable bullet points, especially in your experience bullet points. If you’re getting stuck, use AI bullets to automatically generate a sample bullet point. Be sure to personalize the information so it’s relevant to your experience.\n‍\nExample\n“Implemented a new customer service program that increased monthly retention by 35%.”\n‍\nWrite Resume Achievements With AI\n‍\n‍\nStep 3\nTo tailor your resume to each job, go to Matching Mode and attach a job description to this resume. Teal will automatically provide a list of skills and keywords to optimize your resume. Aim for an 60-75% percent Match Score.\n\n‍\nStep 4\nTeal offers a variety of pre-formatted resume templates designed to be ATS-friendly, which you can choose from in the Design section. You can also change the styling (fonts, colors, etc) to further personalize your resume.\n‍\nStep 5\nAs you’re creating resumes, you may find that certain skills are more relevant to jobs than others, particularly if you’re applying to different types of roles. You can use Teal's Resume Skills Management feature to easily add and toggle skills as needed.\n\n‍\nArea of expertise template\nYour resume is your chance to pitch yourself to recruiters and hiring managers, so be sure to show your expertise throughout, from your Resume Summary, Work Experience, Education, and Skills section.\nHere's a breakdown of the best sections to showcase your expertise, along with a template to get you started.\n‍\nResume summary\nThis is your elevator pitch, so use it wisely. You can write a few sentences summarizing your work experience as it relates to the job you’re targeting.\n‍\nTemplate\n[Personal Adjective] [Your Field] Professional with [X years] of experience in [Specific Areas of Expertise]. Proven ability to [Key Skill 1] and [Key Skill 2], resulting in [Quantifiable Bullet].\n‍\nWork experience\nFocus on bullet points that demonstrate your expertise. You can use Teal’s AI-powered Matching Mode to automatically determine what keywords to incorporate throughout your experience section as you tailor your resume to a specific job.\n‍\nTemplate\n[Strong verb] [action taken] [results] [add metrics if available]\n‍\nExample\nImplemented a new social media marketing strategy utilizing targeted ad campaigns on Facebook and Instagram, resulting in a 20% increase in lead generation in 6 months.\n‍\nEducation\nIn this section, you can highlight relevant coursework, projects, or certifications that demonstrate your expertise. You can also create separate sections for projects and certifications.\n‍\nTemplate:\nUniversity name, Degree (You should typically leave off the year unless you are a recent graduate)\n\n(Optional) Relevant coursework, clubs, activities, GPA\n‍\nSkills\nDon't just list every single skill you have–tailor them to the specific job.\n\nTemplate\nTechnical skills: Python, JavaScript, Rust, Git, AWS, Google Cloud, MySQL, MariaDB\n\nIndustry-specific skills: Project planning, Jira, Confluence, Agile methodology\n‍\nExamples of areas of expertise on a resume\nNeed to see an example of expertise on a resume?

Many applicants make the mistake of writing bullet points that focus more on general responsibilities than accomplishments, which won't grab the attention of employers.\nHere are three key tips to emphasize your expertise in your resume:\n‍\nTip 1: Focus on results, not just skills\nResumes overflowing with lists of generic skills like \"problem-solving\" or \"communication\" are a dime a dozen. Instead, show off your expertise by demonstrating how you've applied those skills to achieve real-world results. Use strong action verbs and quantifiable bullet points.\nFor example, instead of \"Proficient in marketing,\" say: \"Developed and implemented a social media campaign that increased brand engagement by 20% within 3 months.\" This quantifiable bullet paints a clear picture of your expertise and impact.\n‍\nTip 2: Tailor your experience to each job\nA one-size-fits-all resume won't cut it in a competitive job market. Take the time to understand the specific skills and experience the employer is seeking. Identify the areas of expertise most relevant to job descriptions and highlight them prominently in your resume.\nMatch Your Resume to a Job\n‍\n\n‍\nFor instance, if you're applying for a project management role, emphasize your expertise in leading teams, resource allocation, time management, and any project management software you know. This targeted approach demonstrates your understanding of the job requirements and positions you as the ideal candidate.\n‍\nTip 3: Expertise goes beyond work experience\nEspecially for professionals who are looking to make a career change or pivot, don't limit yourself only to traditional work experience. Think outside the box. Did you volunteer for an initiative at a charity that honed your leadership skills? Did you organize a successful school event that demonstrates your communication and problem-solving abilities?\nYou can pull relevant skills and bullet points from a variety of experiences, including volunteer work, extracurricular activities, or even side hustles. This demonstrates your flexibility and ability to apply your expertise in various settings and across multiple industries.\nBy following these tips, you'll create a resume that best spotlights your areas of expertise, making you a standout candidate in a competitive job market.\nPlus, reflecting on your work expertise will help when you’re asked about your qualifications in an interview.\n‍\nThere's no one area for listing expertise on your resume\nBy highlighting your top areas of expertise on your resume, you can set yourself apart in the job market, show the impact you've made in past workplaces, and add credibility to your professional experience through quantifiable bullet points. Just remember to weave your expertise throughout rather than limiting expertise to one section.\nBut tailoring your resume for every job application is time-consuming. That’s why, with Teal’s AI Resume Builder, you can simplify the process, use Matching Mode to get the exact keywords and skills you should be adding to your resume, and save hours in your job search.\nReady to ditch the generic resume and show off your expertise?

Being able to communicate your value clearly and quickly is crucial. \nEnter the mini resume—a tool that condenses your professional story into a concise, impactful format. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting your career, learning the art of the mini resume will help you write a reusable bio, refine your elevator pitch, and feel confident in job interviews.\nThis guide walks you through what a mini resume is, when to use it, and how to create one that stands out in the eyes of prospective employers.\nMake a resume in minutes with Teal.\n‍\nWhat is a mini resume?\nThink of a mini resume as your professional highlight reel, designed to capture attention and showcase your most impressive qualifications in a snapshot.\nA mini resume is a condensed version of a full resume—typically one page or less. Its primary purpose is to provide a quick overview of your key skills and career highlights, serving as a networking tool or a supplement to your full resume. Unlike a traditional resume that covers your entire job history, a mini resume focuses on your most relevant experience and achievements, giving potential employers a brief summary of what you bring to the table.\n‍\nWhen to use a mini resume\nMini resumes can be used in a variety of situations:\nNetworking events and career fairs where time is limited\nInitial introductions to prospective employers to pique their interest\nAs a supplement to a full job application, providing a quick summary of your key qualifications\nFor certain positions or industries that prefer concise applications\nWhen reaching out to contacts for informational interviews or job requests\n‍\nAdvantages of using a mini resume\nA mini resume can help you make a quick, strong impression in competitive situations—be it a networking event or a group discussion interview round. It’s also easier for busy hiring managers and recruiters to review, so it rarely goes ignored. Beyond the circumstantial advantages, here’s why a mini-resume is helpful: \nIt forces you to focus on your most relevant qualifications, in-turn honing your personal brand.\nIt demonstrates your ability to communicate concisely—a valued skill in many jobs.\nIt serves as a versatile tool in various professional settings, from business card exchanges to networking events.\n‍\nHow to write a mini resume\nCreating an effective mini resume requires strategy and precision. Here’s how to craft one that packs a punch and leaves a lasting impression on potential employers:\n‍\n1. Choose the right mini resume format\nThe format of your mini resume should align with your industry and purpose. Common formats include:\nBusiness card style: Ultra-condensed for quick networking encounters, fitting on a standard business card. Should ideally only include your name, job title, and key contact information.\nOne-page summary: A brief overview of your key qualifications and experiences, often one page long. This format should include your professional summary, top achievements, and core skills,\nBrief bullet points: Highlighting your most impressive achievements and skills relevant to the specific job or industry\nSelect the format that best showcases your strengths and fits the context in which you’ll use it. Remember, flexibility is key—you might need different formats for different situations.\n\n‍\n2. Select key information to include\nYour mini resume should include:\nContact info: Essentials like your name, email, phone number, and LinkedIn profile\nProfessional summary or career goals: A brief summary (one to two impactful sentences) outlining your career goals or relevant job experience\nWork experience: Most relevant work history (two to three positions with key achievements)\nKey skills: Qualifications tailored to the target role or industry, focusing on what’s most relevant\nEducation: Credentials applicable and relevant to the job posting\nNotable achievements or volunteer work: Quantify achievements where possible to showcase your impact\n‍\n3. Tailor your content\nWhen you customize your resume for each opportunity, you ensure that it’s always relevant. Here’s how you can tailor it: \nHighlight skills and experiences most relevant to the position or company\nUse industry-specific language and keywords from the job description to show you understand the field\nFocus on achievements that align with the company’s goals and values such as reducing operational costs by 10% for a sustainability-focused company.\nAdjust your career summary or professional background to reflect the specific opportunity\nTeal’s Matching Mode can help you identify the most relevant skills and keywords to include, ensuring your mini resume is better optimized for what the ATS and hiring manager are looking for.\n4. Use powerful language and formatting\nThe words and formatting you choose help hiring managers skim your resume without overlooking key information. By using resume power words, you highlight your accomplishments without having to use long, descriptive paragraphs.\nHere are some quick tips on using power words: \nEmploy action verbs to describe your accomplishments (e.g., \"spearheaded,\" \"implemented,\" \"optimized\")\nQuantify your achievements whenever possible (e.g., \"increased sales by 25% in 6 months\")\nUse bullet points to break up text walls and make your mini resume more skimmable\nBold key information to draw attention to your most impressive qualifications\nMaintain a clean, professional layout with consistent formatting across sections\n‍\nMini resume template\nGetting started with your own mini resume can be overwhelming. Here are a few templates that will help you condense your professional story:\n‍\nBusiness card mini resume\nThis format prioritizes contact information, key personal details and top achievements, perfect for quick networking encounters. It gives just enough information to spark interest and encourage further conversation.\nExample: Jane Doe\nSoftware Engineer\n5+ years experience | Increased app performance by 40%\nEmail: jane@email.com | Phone: (123) 456-7890\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/janedoe\n‍\nOne-page mini resume\nTeal offers the ability to rename and reorder sections on you resume to make the most of the page.\nThis example showcases:\nA brief professional summary highlighting key strengths and career goals\nTop 3-4 skills relevant to the target position\n2-3 professional experiences with bullet points highlighting quantifiable achievements\nA clean, easy-to-read layout with strategic use of white space\n‍\nMini resume examples\nA mini resume can range from a basic set of bullet points to a custom-designed format. These examples will help you create impressive mini resumes of your own: \n‍\nBasic mini resume examples\nA basic mini resume is easy to follow and designed for clarity. \nTeal makes it easy to create a basic mini resume in minutes.\nTo use this template effectively:\nReplace the placeholder text with your own information.\nAdjust sections as needed for your specific experience and target role, but remember not to overload sections with information.\nEnsure all information is relevant, impactful, and tailored to your audience. For example, you can skip your brief stint as a travel guide if you’re applying to a marketing manager position. \n‍\nCreative mini resume examples\nWhile creative resume templates can be eye-catching, they’re most appropriate for industries that value design and innovation, such as graphic design or digital marketing. Always consider your audience when choosing a template. A more conservative design might be better suited for traditional industries like finance or law. Here are two creative resume templates:\n‍\nThe minimalist mini resume \nA minimalist resume includes a few design elements but also leaves a lot of white space on the page to combat overwhelm. It’s clean and aesthetically pleasing. \nImage source: Canva\n‍\nThe infographic mini resume\nAn infographic resume uses tools like status bars and charts to display critical skills so a hiring manager can easily scan these resumes. \n\n‍\n‍\nTips for creating an effective mini resume\nA few small teaks can sometimes make your resume stand out in a sea of applicants. Here are some tips on creating a stand-out mini resume: \n‍\nFocus on relevance\nInclude only information directly related to your target position or industry.\nPrioritize recent and impressive achievements that showcase your potential value.\nTailor your skills list to match job requirements, using keywords from job postings.\n‍\nKeep it concise\nUse short, impactful phrases instead of full sentences to maximize space.\nEliminate unnecessary words and industry jargon that might confuse readers.\nStick to one page or less, ensuring every word earns its place.\n‍\nMake it visually appealing\nUse a clean, professional resume font that’s easy to read (e.g., Arial, Calibri, or Helvetica).\nIncorporate white space strategically to guide the reader’s eye and improve readability.\nEnsure consistent formatting throughout, including font sizes, bullet styles, and spacing.\n‍\nProofread and perfect\nDouble-check for spelling and grammatical errors—even small mistakes can be costly.\nHave a trusted colleague or mentor review your mini resume for feedback.\nRead it aloud to catch awkward phrasing or areas that don’t flow well.\n‍\nCommon mini resume mistakes to avoid\nWhen creating your mini resume, be aware of these pitfalls that could diminish its impact:\n‍\n1. Overloading with information\nResist the urge to cram your entire work history into your mini resume. Focus on your most impressive and relevant experiences. Quality trumps quantity in this format. Remember, the goal is to pique interest, not tell your entire professional story.\n‍\n2. Neglecting to tailor the content\nA one-size-fits-all approach won’t cut it in today’s competitive job market. Take the time to customize your mini resume for each opportunity. This shows you’ve done your homework and are genuinely interested in the position or connection. It also demonstrates your ability to prioritize and communicate effectively.\n‍\n3. Using inappropriate formats\nWhile creativity can set you apart, ensure your mini resume format is appropriate for your industry and the specific situation. A highly designed mini resume might work well for a graphic design position but could be off-putting in a more conservative field like finance or law. Always consider your audience and the context in which your mini resume will be viewed.\n‍\nHow to use your mini resume effectively\nYour mini resume is a powerful tool, but its effectiveness depends on how you use it. Here’s how to maximize its impact in your job search strategy: \n‍\nIntegrate it with your job search strategy\nYour mini resume should complement, not replace, your full resume and cover letter. You can use it as:\nA conversation starter at networking events\nA quick introduction when making initial contact with potential employers\nA follow-up tool to reinforce your key qualifications\nA supplement to your LinkedIn profile, providing a quick overview of your experience\nFollow up with your full application materials when appropriate, and use  your mini resume only as a bridge to more in-depth discussions about your qualifications.\n‍\nFollow up after sharing your mini resume\nAfter sharing your mini resume:\nSend a personalized follow-up email within 24 to 48 hours.\nReference specific points from your conversation to jog their memory.\nExpress your continued interest and suggest next steps, such as a more in-depth discussion or formal interview.\nAttach your full resume if appropriate, building on the interest generated by your mini resume.\nBy strategically using your mini resume and following up effectively, you can create more opportunities and strengthen your professional network.\n‍\nCreate a mini resume in minutes\nThink of a mini resume as your personal elevator pitch, condensed into a format that demands attention and leaves no room for doubt.\nBy honing the art of the mini resume, you’re equipping yourself with a tool that can help you stand out in a crowded job market.

(Plus, get several functional resume examples to use as a guide.)\nTeal's free resume templates can help you put your best foot forward.\nConsidering a functional resume format because your skills outweigh your work experience?\n\nA functional resume focuses on specific skills rather than roles and companies—moving away from a traditional or chronological resume layout. And while it sounds like a good strategy if you're looking to highlight certain abilities, using a functional resume still requires some consideration. \n\n‍\n\nLooking to create a functional resume? Try Teal's AI Resume Builder with flexible resume design.\n\n‍\n\nWhat is a functional resume?\nA functional resume (sometimes called a skills-based resume format) focuses on the skills that qualify you for a role. This resume format prioritizes the tools and aptitudes you've used to do the job over where and when you've done it. \n\n‍\n\nA functional resume example\nFunctional resume templates will prioritize skills over work experience.\n‍\n\nPros and cons of a functional resume\nAs the workforce evolves, functional resumes have become increasingly popular—but not universally accepted; the trend toward functional resumes is more prevalent among job seekers than hiring professionals.\n\nBy emphasizing transferable skills and abilities, a functional resume allows anyone with a non-linear career path or limited work experience to present areas of strengths and potential rather than a job history.\n\nBut while the core of a functional resume emphasizes skills and competencies, it doesn't focus on:\n\nDates\nJob title\nCompanies\nComprehensive work history \n‍\n\nBefore you choose to write one, here are some pros and cons you should know about.\n\nPros of functional resumes\nEmphasizes skills by highlighting abilities over job titles\nShowcases potential by focusing on strengths\nFlexible for transitions because it highlights relevant skills from past roles, even if the job titles don’t match\nFocuses on strengths with your top skills front and center—regardless of career progression\n‍\n\nCons of a functional resume format\nLack of familiarity: Recruiters may find a functional resume less intuitive, making it harder to extract critical information quickly.\nPotential for skepticism: The absence of a chronological work history can look like an attempt to hide gaps in employment or a lack of specific experience.\nDifficulty establishing career progression: Demonstrating professional growth over time is often key to emphasizing the evolution of roles and responsibilities.\nLimited skills showcase: Functional resumes miss the opportunity to show the breadth of your abilities. A range of skills throughout your resume will help align your experience with a job's requirements. Merely listing skills without showing how they've been applied collectively to have an impact undermines the effectiveness of your entire resume.\n‍\n\nFunctional resume format vs. other resume formats\nA functional resume format differs in structure and organization than other styles. Here's what you need to know about the similarities and differences.\n\nChronological resume\nA chronological resume (or reverse-chronological resume) is the most widely accepted resume format—presenting your work history in reverse chronological order.\n\nIt offers a straightforward view of your career progression, highlighting your work experience and making it easy for hiring managers and recruiters to see your background, achievements, and how you've used your skills to have an impact over time.\n\nUse a chronological resume to show a clear view of your career, impact, and skills.\nView this full selection of free reverse-chronological resume templates to find a style and presentation that suits your career.\n\n‍\n\nCombination resume\nThe combination resume, or hybrid, blends elements of both functional and chronological resumes while still offering a clear and easy-to-read layout. It typically starts with a professional summary, followed by a section for hard or technical skills, and then a reverse chronological listing of your work history. \n\n\nUse a combination resume to focus on skills and work experience.\n‍\n\nWhen to use a functional resume\nIf you've made it this far and still feel the best resume format is a skills-based resume, here are the best use cases.\n\nCareer pivoters\n\nSuppose you're transitioning to a new industry or career path. In that case, a functional resume can help highlight transferable skills relevant to your new field—regardless of where you've acquired them.\n\nThose with employment gaps\n\nIf you have a gap in your employment, you can use a functional resume to emphasize your skills, highlighting what you bring to the table rather than focusing on your employment history.\n\nReentering the workforce\n\nIf you're returning to work after a significant break, a functional resume can help you highlight your relevant, valuable skills.\n\nFirst-time job seekers\n\nIf you're a job seeker creating a resume with no work experience, a functional resume format focuses on skills rather than a non-existent or thin work history.\n\nFor applications that request this format\n\nSome job postings might request a functional resume. In these cases, sticking to this format shows you can follow directions and understand the specific preferences of your prospective employer.\n\n‍\n\nHow to write a functional resume\nBefore you choose a resume format, you need the right tool to store your skills, achievements, and more. \n\nThe Teal AI Resume Builder is a free platform to house all these details in one central location. \n\nSign Up, It's Free\nA screenshot showing what professional details are stored in the Teal AI Resume Builder \nWith Teal, managing your career history becomes organized, functional, and straightforward.\nNow, it's time to write your functional resume.\n\n‍\n\n1. Start with your contact information\nYou want prospective employers to contact you, so you're going to need to give them those details as clearly as possible.\n\nYour resume contact information should include:\n\nFull Name\nPhone Number\nLocation\nProfessional email address\nLinkedIn profile URL \nPortfolio or personal website URL (if applicable)\nYour target title\n‍\n\n2. Add a professional summary\nBelow your contact information, write a 3-5 sentence professional summary. Consider this your highlight reel—zeroing in on top achievements, skills, and qualifications while generating enough interest to keep the hiring manager or recruiter reading the rest of your resume.\n\nPro Tip: If you want to save time writing your professional summary, try Teal’s AI Resume Summary Generator to write tailored, position-specific summaries in seconds.\n\n‍\n\n3. List relevant skills\nNext up, list your skills. Because you're using a functional resume format, this section will change each time you apply for a specific role.\n\nThe skills in your resume (regardless of format) should always align with the job description of the role you're applying to.\n\nResume skills example: \n\nIf a job description says,\n\n\"3 years of experience in an SEO, Growth Ops, or Marketing Ops role, ideally in a startup environment for a B2C audience with strong knowledge building and owning workflows as it relates to SEO, content production, and publishing.\"\n\nThen, your resume's \"Skill\" section should focus on at least three skills listed. \n\nSEO\nGrowth Ops\nContent Production\nNot sure which skills matter most?

Then, just move it to the best location for your format using the Drag-and-Drop Editor.\n\n\n‍\n\n4. Add optional sections\nOnce you have your primary skills and the impact of those skills, add job history, an \"Education\" section, and certifications to support them.\n\n‍\n\n4 tips for writing a functional resume\nNow that you understand how to write a functional resume let's go over some best practices that'll help guide you.\n\nOnly emphasize relevant skills: Identify the skills most relevant to the job you’re applying for and provide specific examples of how you used those skills.\nQuantify your achievements: Wherever possible, use numbers, metrics, and data to show the impact of your work. Think efficiency improvements, revenue growth, etc.\nUse a clear, organized layout: Ensure your resume is easy to read. Use headings, bullet points, and consistent formatting to make your skills and achievements stand out.\nTailor your resume: Customize your target title, resume summary, skills, and bullet points—ensuring your content aligns with what an employer is looking for.\n‍\n\nFunctional resume format\nThe functional resume layout differs significantly from other traditional formats. Here's how to do it:\n\nContact details\nYour resume summary\nA clear \"Skills\" section with achievements relevant to the role\nIf you include an employment history, place it after the skills section. Education and any other relevant details (certifications or volunteer experience) should come last.\n\n‍\n\n3 tips for formatting a functional resume\nProvide clarity: Use a clean, easy-to-read layout. Opt for bullet points to describe your skills and achievements, making the resume scannable.\nUse consistent formatting: Your resume content should stick to one font style and size, with clear and slightly larger or bolded headings to distinguish each section.\nBalance white space and text: A well-balanced layout avoids clutter, making your resume clear and easy to read.\n‍\n\nFunctional resume examples\nA functional resume example can help guide your process—giving you a clear idea of how to create a compelling functional resume.\n\nData analyst functional resume example\nA functional resume example for a data analyst \nLooking for a job in data analysis?

Limit included years of relevant experience\nHow far back should your resume really go?\n\nUnless you're applying for a role as a C-suite level executive, it's best practice to limit your years of relevant experience to the past 10-15 years. \n\nLimiting the number of jobs or years allows you to focus on your most recent and relevant professional experiences, which will likely be the most valuable for potential employers. \n\nIt also helps keep your resume concise and manageable. Remember, unless you're changing careers, recruiters and hiring managers are primarily interested in your recent accomplishments and skills directly related to the position you're applying for. \n\n‍\n\n2. Include the same basic information for each company \nIncluding the same basic information for each company in every resume job description maintains consistency throughout your resume. This basic information should include:\n\nCompany name\nYour position or official job title\nCompany location (or remote if applicable)\nDates of your employment\n3-5 job description achievements per job title\nBy presenting information in a uniform resume format, you create a professional and organized appearance, making it easier for hiring managers and recruiters to review and assess your work history. \n\nConsistency also helps establish a clear career progression and narrative—enabling potential employers to compare your experiences across different organizations easily.\n\nHow long have you stayed with different companies? Has your career advanced? Where have you taken opportunities? When presented consistently, these patterns are easier to observe. \n\n‍\n\n3. Include relevant achievements \nEach of your job descriptions should have around three to five relevant achievements. And they should be formatted with resume bullet points—approximately three to five bullet points for each job description. \n\nList these achievements based on the most impressive and relevant information, and rather than just listing job duties or job responsibilities and structure your bullet points to focus on specific accomplishments and results.\n\n‍\n\n4. Show metrics and impact \n\n\nAdding metrics to the achievements in your Resume Job Description section can help you stand out from other job seekers. They're measurable evidence of accomplishments and impact in previous roles, showcasing your incredible work.\n\nWhen deciding which metrics to include, consider areas like:\n\nRevenue increased\nMoney saved \nProcess Improvements and the measurable impact \nNumber of employees managed and the retention rate \nProcess refinement and subsequent time saved \n‍\n\n5. Use action verbs \nThe best action verbs for resume and work history make your experience more dynamic and engaging because they create a sense of, well, action. \n\nInstead of using passive verbs, like \"responsible for\" or \"assisted with,\" try words like achieved, exceeded, generated, improved, or optimized, and connect those verbs to measurable achievements. \n\n‍\n\n6. Be honest\nBeing honest about your work experience is crucial. Honesty builds trust. And when you accurately represent your skills, responsibilities, and accomplishments, you establish credibility (and integrity). \n\nBeing honest also ensures a good fit between your qualifications and the requirements found in the job ad. By accurately portraying your previous positions, you offer potential employers a real look at your capabilities. \n\n‍\n\nTailoring your resume job descriptions\nYour resume should align with the specific job posting of the role you're applying for. This means including relevant skills (hard skills and soft skills) and other important language in the key achievements of your \"Work Experience\" section.\n\nSo how do you find that information?\n\nThe Teal AI Resume Builder and Job Application tracker pull the top keywords (as skills and emphasis words) so you can incorporate exactly what hiring managers are looking for into your resume.

But don't get overwhelmed just yet. You don't necessarily need a job title to impress prospective employers.\n\nThink about your life experience up to this point.\n\nWere you involved in student organizations? Did you do any volunteer work? How about unpaid internships, certifications, or projects?\n\nThese experiences are fundamental. And the many skills you picked up along the way are transferable—helping get your resume noticed by a hiring manager or recruiter.\n\n‍\n\nSo let's take a look at some examples of resume job descriptions with no work experience.\n\n‍\n\nResume job description examples with no work experience\nProject-focused\nSenior Graphic Design Project\n\nApril 2023\n\nReceived a 98% grade by increasing Miami Senior High School Annual Charity Walkathon attendance by 30%.

Executive job seekers need resumes that tell a compelling story about how their leadership impacted business growth.\nThis guide breaks down each step, from picking the right resume format to tailoring your resume for specific executive positions.\nStruggling to land interviews? Create a resume fit for an executive with Teal.\n‍\nUnderstanding the executive resume\nAn executive resume is a targeted, professional resume designed to showcase an individual's success in high-level roles. Executive resumes are used by current executives looking for a lateral move in the C-suite or those in VP-level, or similar, positions looking to take that next step in their careers with a chief-level title.\nUnlike standard resumes, executive resumes emphasize the ability to lead people to reach a goal. For companies hiring executives, culture fit is a non-negotiable. Therefore, executive resumes focus on leadership achievements and alignment with a company mission.\nAt the executive level, transition from proving your technical skills to proving your leadership skills. Ensure you show a clear leadership growth progression. Tailor your jobs to meet the requirements on executive job descriptions. With Teal’s Resume Builder, you can quickly create strategic resumes tailored to every job.\n\n‍\nWhat to include in an executive resume\nExecutive resumes should be immediately identifiable at first glance—well-organized with common resume sections like contact information, work history, and skills.\nThese resumes should also contain a headline with your executive job title, examples of your leadership achievements, and an executive profile tailored for each application. Your executive resume should communicate your leadership skill set and experience—quickly. \nHere's what hiring managers want to see on an executive resume:\nLeadership ability\nBusiness impact\nCompany alignment\nLike all resumes, executive resumes need to include basic information about you:\nContact information\nProfessional summary\nWork experience\nEducation\nSkills\nHere are some additional sections to include in an executive resume:\nExecutive summary\nHeadline\nCertifications and training\nAwards, honors, and projects\nVolunteer work\nTo optimize your executive resume, include each of these sections:\n‍\nContact information\nYour name is the most important information on your resume. It should be the first thing you see: at the top of your page, biggest font, boldest type. This is part of your personal brand.\nDon't make employers search for how to get in touch. Follow your name with your email address, phone number, location, and LinkedIn profile. If you have a personal website or online personal portfolio, you can finish this section with a link in your resume. \nReuse this contact information section on your cover letter.\n‍\nWork experience\nYour resume work experience will make up most of your resume real estate. Teal recommends 15 resume accomplishments throughout your whole resume. Front-load your most recent and relevant accomplishments. Many executives, especially ones with many years of experience, struggle to remove previous companies from early in their careers. However, hiring managers are most interested in your most recent work, so you can cap your experience at a decade.\nWhen you have climbed the corporate ladder, the trick to writing an effective professional experience section is to show how your efforts made an impact. Use metrics to quantify your impact. Numbers are great on a resume because they easily translate from one role to another. You can be sure everyone understands your contributions caused a 20 percent increase in sales revenue.\nEach bullet point should instead be a highly specific key accomplishment that is a direct result of your work. Keep these focused on key business metrics like increasing revenue, decreasing costs, saving time, gaining accounts, and similar metrics. \nTeal's AI Achievement assistant uses a combination of action verbs, metrics, and needed project context from your job history to create compelling bullet points to highlight your top achievements for every job.\n‍\n‍\nEducation\nAs a professional with work experience, your education should be at the end of your resume. In some cases, you can put your degree in a two-column resume template instead. An executive resume should always lead with work experience. \n‍\nSkills and competencies\nAt the executive level, your senior management skills are more important than your technical skills. A hiring manager needs to know you can inspire people. Add your soft skills throughout your summary, work experience, or resume headline, as long as they support your leadership experience.\nYour skills section should focus on your most relevant skills, like process improvement, business development, strategic planning, critical thinking, and key executive skills, like change management or restructuring. You can mix in a few soft and hard skills, like public speaking and industry knowledge.\n‍\nExecutive summary\nA strong resume summary pulls out key skills, projects, and wins from the resume body to create a snapshot of your career highlights. You can think of it as your elevator pitch to market yourself for an executive position.\nTo transform a basic resume summary to an executive summary, position yourself as an expert in one key skill. Relate your key achievements. Use numbers to prove your business impact. Frame out a story of how your expertise in this skill or subject has a repeatable track-record of success.‍\n\nResume headline\nA compelling resume headline is a powerful tool for executives. Most people don't include one, and many others simply use a job title. Your resume headline should be an attention-grabbing value proposition. What compelling statement will entice someone to give you an interview and end your job search?\nThink about your target position, as well as your personal philosophy or personal branding statement based on your years of experience. It's a clever place to preview your key accomplishments related to your strategic direction ability. You can include phrases like “award-winning” or “proven track record.” \nYour headline should include your target job title and your most enticing qualifications. Here are some examples:\nVisionary CEO with 10+ years’ experience leading Fortune 100 companies \nChief of Technology Officer specializing in DevOps, generative AI, and strategy\nDynamic financial leader with a proven track record of revenue growth in new markets\n‍\nLeadership training and certifications\nThis is an additional section that other candidates applying for the same position may not have. If you have additional certifications or training that better qualify you for executive positions, this can be a great differentiator for hiring managers.\nConsider technical certifications, leadership development courses, and leadership training such as Creative C Leadership or Kellogg Management.\n‍\nAwards and projects\nIf you have several awards that are all relevant to your job search, you can make a section for those awards and projects associated with a professional development organization or other professional affiliations.\nThis is where you list leadership achievements like “Business Leader of the Year, [Organization], [Year]” or “Spearheaded alumni association silent auction to raise 25k in 2019.”\n‍\nVolunteer experience\nYou don't have to include this section, but if you have the experience it is a nice differentiator. This is where you should mention your senior director role or position on the board of directors for a nonprofit. Keep it relevant to your ability to lead people or champion causes.\n‍\nHow to address leadership achievements on a resume\nUnfortunately, executive resumes often fail to focus on recent achievements or don't prioritize the right ones for the new role.\n‍\n1. Display a proven track record of leadership\nShow, don't tell. An executive resume should include several achievement examples. Each bullet point should highlight a highly specific key accomplishment that is a direct result of your strategic direction as a vice president or senior director.\nExamples of leadership achievements\nLed a successful negotiation for a $100 million credit facility at a 2% lower interest rate than the industry average, enhancing the company's liquidity and investment capabilities.\nLed a global marketing team across five regions, aligning efforts and achieving a unified marketing message that contributed to a 18% year-over-year revenue growth.\nManaged a marketing team of 20 professionals, achieving a 51% increase in lead generation through the optimization of inbound marketing tactics.\n‍\n2. Show results from your business development initiatives\nUse numbers to communicate the value in your professional background. Excellent business leaders prove their impact on their resumes. Think about increasing revenue, decreasing costs, saving time, gaining accounts, and so on. Back up all your achievement claims with quantifiable evidence.\nExamples of business development achievements\nCultivated a high-performance finance team through strategic hiring and targeted professional development, leading to a 20% increase in departmental productivity and efficiency.\nSpearheaded the adoption of marketing automation and CRM tools, resulting in a 25% increase in marketing efficiency and a 20% uptick in sales conversions.\nChampioned a comprehensive digital marketing strategy that increased online sales by 35% within the first year of implementation.\nTeal’s AI Resume Achievements tool can write leadership achievements as metric-rich accomplishment statements for you.\n‍\n‍\n3. Align your executive experience to the job description\nIn addition to your experience and qualifications, your resume should show your alignment with a specific company’s values and mission. The will help you stand out from the other candidates.‍\nCommon challenges when writing an executive resume\nThe most common challenge executives have when writing their resumes is having too much information.\nExecutives should understand better than most that time is money.  More words does not mean more impact. In fact, it's often the opposite. The easier it is to understand what you're capable of achieving, the more interest you'll receive.\n‍\nHere are 10 items that don't belong on your resume, and how to fix them:\n1. Anything other than your name on the first line\nInclude your name only, with no credentials or job titles.\n2. A resume objective\nUse a resume summary or executive profile instead.\n3. A GPA\nYour degree, school, and its location. \n4. Graduation year\nYour degree, school, and its location.‍\n5. Your street address\nInclude city and state only.\n6. Your company email\nUse a professional personal email address that your current employer can’t access.\n7. Experience from 10+ years ago\nKeep your executive resume focused on your recent experience.\n8. A job title as a headline\nUse a resume headline that incorporates your target job title and key qualifications.\n9. Typos and mistakes\nUse spell check and proofread your resume meticulously.\n10. Too much detail\nUse white space and bullet points to ensure your resume is user friendly.\n‍\nExecutive resume tips\nTo craft an executive resume that stands out, focus on your leadership achievements and align them with the company's mission and values. An effective resume will emphasize specific examples of strategic leadership and measurable business impact, highlighting your ability to lead and drive results.\n‍\n1. Keep your format simple\nYour executive resume must be as simple as possible. Most of the mistakes above have to do with overly complicating your resume. This will muddy your message. Stay laser-focused on why you’re the right potential C-level, senior executive, or vice president. You can expand on your notable achievements in your cover letter.\n‍\n2. Cater to an ATS\nSimplicity is key for online applications, which use applicant tracking systems (ATS). Professionals in recruitment and human resources use these systems to parse your resume. It generates a standard report for the hiring manager, making it easy to compare many candidates. \n‍\n3. Focus on your experience, not your age\nThe other theme you must avoid is ageism. If you detail the year you graduated or the year you got your first job, you open yourself up to age-related discrimination that could cost you an interview. Keep the focus on your recent leadership accomplishments and relevant experience.\n‍\n4. Proofread\nUse a word processor to spell check your resume. Mistakes are easy to make but will hurt your job search. Look for common typos spell check won’t catch, like “manger,\"\nPro Tip: The Teal AI Resume Builder has spell check built in to help you avoid embarrassing typos.\n‍\n\n‍\n5. Be sure each section is clearly labeled\nAll of the sections within your executive resume should be clearly labeled except your contact details. The labeled headings will help applicant tracking systems parse your resume correctly for human resource use. You don’t need to include sections that aren’t relevant to you.\nYou may also move the sections around. Arrange your resume logically. Keep your most compelling information at the top. Remember you want your most impressive achievements to be on the top half of your first page.\nThere isn’t a specific number of words or pages you need to limit yourself to, but if you’re curious about how long a resume should be, aim for two or three pages.\n‍\nExecutive resume template\nThe easiest way to get started with your executive resume is using a proven template. The best executive resume templates are simple, polished, and modern without being flashy or outdated. Here are some resume templates from Teal's library to consider.\n‍‍\nFormatting an executive resume\nUse a clear layout\nHiring managers need to fill job vacancies fast, whether it's a sales rep or a new chief executive officer. Recruiters will scan your resume in seven seconds so your name, job titles, and impact need to be immediately obvious to earn a closer look. Keep your layout simple.\nRecruiters tend to skim resumes in an F pattern, starting at the top, then the first section, then down the page. This visual scan takes seconds. Some executive recruiters favor a Z motion, preferring a more thorough review for hiring at this level.\n\n‍\nOrganize chronologically\nThe executive style resume format is organized and targeted. The most logical format for highlighting leadership experience on an executive resume is to use a reverse-chronological resume. By listing your professional experience chronologically, starting with your most recent position, you keep your most recent accomplishments top of mind.\nThe benefit of the revers-chronological format is that your most impressive work is typically recent and, thus, listed first. This is in line with the F pattern scanning technique, ensuring that your key achievements are noticed quickly. \n‍\nTwo page maximum\nHigh-level resumes have a lot of information. They describe many years of experience in three pages or fewer. \n\nThe top half of your first page is your most valuable real estate. Make sure your name, headline, and summary are precisely calibrated to reach your goal. There’s advice for how to do this further down in this article.\n‍\nExample executive resumes\nHere are several samples of senior executive resumes with various job titles from Teal's library of 1,500+ resume examples.\n‍\nExecutive resume sample: Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\n\nWhy it works\nThis executive resume example is tidy while still being exhaustive. It's easy to find job titles, education, certifications, and skills within a few seconds.\nLook at the top half of the first page (only one page is shown). The name is the first thing that stands out. The professional summary is brief, including plenty of keywords and metrics expected on a chief financial officer resume.\nThe career experience shows this executive's current position held, Chief Financial Officer, and quickly demonstrates experience in financial restructuring, financial planning, and business development. Similar to the executive resume summary, these bullet points include several eye-catching numbers to prove impact.\nA right column displays the required skills and the executive's MBA degree. This is a great example of strategic planning to satisfy a job description.\n‍\nExecutive resume sample: Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)\n\nWhy it works\nThis layout uses lots of negative space. White space can strategically draw the hiring manager's eye to certain information. This executive resume example uses white space around the job title, making it seem important.\nThe experience section of this resume example uses white space to emphasize the companies and job titles. Each bullet point uses white space at the end of the second line, making the accomplishments easier to skim.\nThere is no skills section on this page. This is strategic planning, showing off the experience by default. Whereas an executive resume example for a Chief Information Officer or Chief Operating Officer would have a dedication hard skills section, this Chief Marketing Officer knows her work experience is more intriguing.\n‍\nWhy it works\nA VP of Marketing knows the power of a strong personal brand. This resume example incorporates color, font styles, and clever positioning statements to showcase her extensive marketing expertise. The professional summary incorporates tailored key skills and precise job functions. The language throughout the resume is optimized and deliberate, as you would expect of a senior marketing manager.\nThis resume sample uses the right amount of color to make the headings pop. Your resume doesn’t have to be black and white, but keep your colors subdued. Again, you want to keep the focus on your accomplishments. Steer clear of bright colors. Use a dark green, purple, or blue instead. A bold maroon can work well, too. Make sure it shows up well on screen and on paper.\nKeep the design elements like bullet points and color very simple to ensure the focus stays on your work, not your resume. Let your impact make an impression, not your document borders. \nPro tip: use the same personal branding elements on your resume, online profiles, and cover letter. Your name will be one common theme, so style it the same way each time, e.g. Tina Miller vs. Tina J. Miller. Teal's Resume Builder and Cover Letter Generator can automate this for you.\n‍\n‍\nHow to write an executive resume\nThe easiest way to create a senior executive resume on a professional template is to use a pre-formatted template. That way, you don’t have to worry about consistent formatting or designing a modern resume layout; the builder tool covers that, freeing you up to focus on the content.\nHere’s how to build your resume in minutes with Teal's AI Resume Builder:\n‍\n1. Upload your resume\nTeal will parse your contact information, skills, experience, and education. Your information will populate automatically in the correct section. If you don't have a resume, you can upload your LinkedIn profile using the URL instead. You can edit any of the sections as needed.\n\n‍\n2. Choose a professional template\nNow that your content is in the builder, you can quickly preview your resume on several modern, professional templates. You can customize all the options.\n‍\n3. Optimize your resume with the resume analysis tool\nYour resume analysis will identify missing information, such as your location or phone number.

It will call out if your professional summary needs to be shorter.\nYou can edit the suggestions yourself or use AI features to rewrite it. Your score will improve as you change your resume.\n‍\n\n‍\nTeal’s Resume Analysis will automatically identify errors and show you how to fix them on your resume.\nOnce you've written your full career history with metric-rich achievement statements and resume summary using Teal's AI, you can edit your skills.\n‍\n4. Tailor your resume a the job with a match score\nOnce your resume looks right, copy and paste a job description for your ideal executive position. Teal will compare the job description to your resume and give you a match score. Don't worry if this score is low to begin with. Tailoring your resume to the job description will improve the score quickly.\n‍\n\n‍\nIf you’re missing relevant skills, Teal will highlight them. If you have those skills, you can add them to your resume immediately. Look to add soft skills to your resume summary and work experience. Add technical and hard skills to your skills section. The more you add, the more options you can select for future applications.\nGo beyond excellent job fit by researching the company. As a potential company leader, your resume should reassure the recruiter that you can further a company mission. For example, if you want to be the chief executive officer of a struggling company, your resume should showcase your ability to manage crises, carry out your strategic vision, and your history of leading during a successful corporate restructure.\n‍\nTell a compelling story with your executive resume\nAn impactful executive resume is a great tool for a successful job search. Catch hiring manager's eye with a clean, professional resume layout that highlights your alignment to an executive role and company. Your resume must be more than a list of previous jobs; you need to tell a compelling story of your leadership prowess, strategic vision, and ability to motivate people to drive significant results under your guidance.\nStreamline your efforts by using Teal’s AI Resume Creator.

But what can make it stand out and grab the attention of a hiring manager? Short answer: Effectively communicating your professional accomplishments. \nMost job seekers make the mistake of simply listing duties or tasks you’d find in their current job description. But that doesn’t tell potential employers why you’re right for their role. Listing achievements in your resume and job application can help you cut through the noise by offering a more complete picture of what you’ve done.\nHere’s the good news—you don’t have to figure this out alone. You can use the AI Resume Builder feature to write your achievements for you, so you’re never starting from scratch. Plus, this guide breaks down how to write achievements in a resume, if you’d prefer not to use AI. \n‍\nWhat are resume achievements?\nResume achievements are the accomplishments featured on a resume. They should focus on how you’ve contributed to a particular role, department, or business using concrete and measurable business outcomes.\nThat means including any awards and specific metrics that typically include numbers or other KPIs to illustrate the point.\n‍\nTypes of achievements\nWhen showcasing your accomplishments on a resume, you can highlight achievements from various aspects of your life—as long as they’re relevant to the job you’re applying for.\nWhether personal, professional, or academic, each type of achievement helps paint a fuller picture of your qualifications and strengths. Here’s a breakdown of the main categories of achievements you can include.\n‍\nPersonal achievements\nPersonal achievements are milestones or accomplishments outside of your job. These could include volunteer work, personal development projects, or even relevant hobbies that demonstrate skills like leadership, creativity, or perseverance. While these may not be directly related to your current job, they can highlight traits and qualities that set you apart.\n‍\nProfessional achievements\nProfessional achievements are directly tied to your career and showcase the impact you’ve made in previous roles. \nThese accomplishments often focus on measurable outcomes, like increased revenue, process improvements, or successful project management. Highlighting these on your resume demonstrates your ability to drive results and contribute meaningfully to an organization.\n‍\nAcademic achievements\nAcademic achievements reflect your educational background and accomplishments in school or university settings. This could include awards, scholarships, high GPAs, or research projects. \nThese achievements are especially important for those early in their career (think: focusing on an entry-level job) or transitioning into new industries where education is a key component of the job.\n‍\nStruggling to write resume achievements? Write them faster with Teal’s AI Resume Builder now.\n‍\nAchievement examples\nAchievement examples are key highlights of your career that demonstrate the ability to contribute effectively to a company or project. Below are achievement examples covering how to to solve problems, drive growth, or achieve specific goals. Use this range of examples of achievements to inspire your own.\n‍\nPersonal achievements examples\nOrganized charity event that raised $10,000 \nCompleted an advanced Excel course improving data skills and efficiency by 20%\nLed a team of 15 volunteers for a community garden project\nAttracted 5,000 monthly readers through a personal blog on digital marketing\nReduced waste by 30% through a neighborhood recycling initiative,\nGrew a local networking group to 50 members\nWon a public speaking award after completing a course\nMentored five junior colleagues, improving their performance and productivity by 15%.\nCompleted a self-paced Python course, improving task automation by 25%.\n‍\nProfessional achievements\nIncreased website traffic by 52% in 12 months\nImplemented cost-saving measures and reduced expenses by 30%\nStreamlined bookkeeping protocols, reducing errors by 15%\nManaged a team of 10 employees and increased customer retention rates by 7%\nConsolidated vendors, saving the company $35,000 annually\nExceeded sales targets by 25% in Q1\nLed the DEI committee, leading to a 91% company approval rating on workplace inclusivity\nSecured five major partnerships for a media campaign\n‍\nAcademic achievements examples\nGraduated with a 3.9 GPA in Computer Science\nCompleted research project published in peer-reviewed journal, attracting a $25,000 grant\nReceived a full academic scholarship for outstanding academic performance\nLed a team of 6 to win a national business case competition, resulting in internship offers for all team members\nEarned Dean’s List honors for six consecutive semesters\n‍\nHow to write resume achievements\nWriting an effective achievement statement is pretty simple. Here’s the framework to help turn any work accomplishment into an eye-catching resume achievement:\n‍\nResume achievement formula\n‍Here’s the step-by-step breakdown of this achievement formula:\n‍\nAction Verb\nStart each achievement with a strong action verb that highlights what you did. Examples include \"led,\" \"designed,\" \"increased,\" or \"improved.\" This creates an active and engaging statement that clearly defines your role.\n‍\nNoun\nThe noun describes what you worked on or influenced. It could be a process, project, team, or product. This provides context for your action and connects it to something tangible in the workplace.\n‍\nMetric\nThe metric demonstrates the impact of your achievement. It can be a percentage, dollar amount, or any quantifiable data that shows the significance of your work. Including metrics makes your achievements more concrete and impressive.\n‍\nStrategy Optional\nIf applicable, you can add details on the strategy, method, or skills used to achieve the result. This is optional but can provide extra depth and relevance to a specific job.\n‍\nOutcome\nFinally, state the positive result or impact of your action. What was achieved or improved? Focus on outcomes that align with the role you’re applying for, whether it’s cost savings, productivity increases, or other business outcomes.\nExample\n‍\nLed a team (Action Verb + Noun) to redesign the company’s website (Noun), improving user engagement by 25% (Metric) and increasing sales conversions by 10% (Outcome).\n‍\nStep 1: Identify your achievements\nOne common question many job seekers have is, “How should I write my achievements in my resume?” Figuring out how to showcase your achievements on a resume can feel challenging, but breaking it down into the right questions can make the process easier. \n‍\nCareer coach Annette Garsteck offers some simple career advice to get started, suggesting you ask yourself these questions:\nWhat did I improve?\nDid I help reduce company costs?\nHow did I contribute to increased efficiency?\nWhere did I exceed a goal or KPI?\nWas I recognized with an award or honor?\n“After answering the above questions, go a bit deeper and add a quantifier. Demonstrating the outcome you achieved on your resume will help you stand apart from the competition,” says Garsteck. Numerical metrics, she says, are one of the best ways to showcase professional results:\n“I format accomplishments on a resume with numbers that demonstrate the scope of the responsibility, the percent improvement, savings, time savings in hours or full-time equivalents, how much a goal or target was exceeded, and the name of the award or honor given.”\n‍\nWhen listing your accomplishments, you can combine personal and professional achievements. For those with less work experience, personal achievements, like academic awards or significant hobbies, can be valuable. If they’re relevant to the role, make sure to include them.\n‍\nWrite resume achievements faster with Teal\nTo make it even easier to identify, write, and refine your achievements, try Teal's AI Resume Bullet Point Generator. \nTeal pulls from your career history as well as a specific job to tailor each accomplishment to JD requirements while ensuring that relevant keywords and your metrics are included. You can also customize the output with a specific prompt or keywords—without toggling between an additional program and your resume.\n‍\n‍\nStep 2: Choose an action verb\nAn action verb, as you can probably guess, is a verb that demonstrates a particular action. As Eva Steortz, an ICF-certified executive coach at Vita Creativa explains:\n“Writing your resume is no time to be modest. You have to tell interesting stories about what you are most proud of achieving in your career. Pick the scenarios where your actions led to a significant result. Be concise and specific using interesting action verbs like increased, elevated, created, and revamped. Use numbers when applicable, but a description of the impact your actions had works, too.”\n‍\nWith that in mind, some action verbs you can consider using in your resume include:\nAnalyzed\nDirected\nIntegrated\nConducted\nProduced\nGenerated\nAdministered\nOrganized\nFacilitated\nEvaluated\nCoordinated\nDemonstrated\nTested\nDeveloped\nCommunicated\nOverhauled\nTaught\nGuided\nCollaborated\nTrained\n‍\nRelated: Check out 250+ more examples of action verbs for your resume.\n‍\nStep 3: Quantify your achievements with metrics\nMetrics provide measurable evidence of your success. Instead of a vague statement like \"Saved the company money,\" you would specify, \"Saved the company $75,000 by reducing the operating budget.\" Quantifying your accomplishments helps potential employers understand the concrete impact you've had.\n‍\nCommon resume achievement metrics\nAnnual revenue\nProfit\nConversion rates\nRetention rates\nProject completion time\nCustomer satisfaction\nSales\n‍\nDifferent professions may focus on other metrics as well. Research common OKRs and KPIs for your industry to craft compelling and relevant achievements.\n‍\nResume achievement metric examples\nIncreased follower count by 100,000 across social media accounts\nImplemented a new SEO strategy, boosting website traffic by 52% in the past year\nAnalyzed hundreds of online reviews to develop a strategy to increase customer satisfaction\nCreated a new curriculum, raising test scores by 23% from the previous school year\n‍\nThe metrics you end up using depend on your industry and your role. What you’re measuring can be expressed as a percentage, dollar amount, or time saved. Which one should you use when writing resume accomplishments? The one that sounds the most impressive.\n‍\nGoing back to the “Saved the company $75,000, reducing the operating budget” as one of the accomplishments examples, whether you use a dollar amount or percentage will depend on the overall budget.\n‍\nLet’s say the operating budget is one million dollars. As a percentage, that would be “Reduced the operating budget by 7.5%” Which one sounds better? Obviously, the achievement example about saving the company $75,000. On its own, that sounds like a good chunk of change, even if it’s a small percentage of the total budget.\n‍\nStep 4: Include your strategy and skills\nIt’s optional, but adding the strategy you used and the skills that contributed to your achievements can provide more depth to your resume. Including how you accomplished something gives hiring managers insight into your problem-solving abilities, thought process, and specific expertise. \n‍\nExamples of achievements with strategy and skills:\nIncreased open rate by 31% for company newsletter in 4 weeks by implementing A/B testing and email segmentation.\nDeveloped a training program using cross-functional collaboration tools that helped onboard 10 new employees in three months.\nCreated and executed a sales strategy focused on customer retention, increasing revenue by 65% in two years.\nBy showcasing the strategy and skills involved, you give potential employers a fuller picture of your capabilities.\n‍\nStep 5: Focus on the outcome\nWhen writing achievements for your resume, the outcome is what truly matters. It shows the direct impact of your actions and helps employers understand the value you brought to your previous roles. \nA measurable outcome, such as a timeframe or specific result, can make your achievements stand out even more. Demonstrating that you achieved something within a specific period or delivered a tangible result offers concrete proof of your capabilities.\nExamples of outcome-focused achievements include:\nIncreased open rate by 31% for company newsletter in 4 weeks by implementing a new strategy.\nTrained 10 new employees over three months, improving onboarding efficiency and reducing ramp-up time.\nDeveloped a sales system that increased revenue by 65% in two years, contributing to the company’s overall growth.\n‍\nAchievements examples for resume\nBelow, you'll find examples of achievements that can be included on your resume. \nThese achievement examples will help you understand how to highlight your contributions in a way that resonates with potential employers. Whether it's professional accomplishments, personal successes, or academic achievements, the following resume achievements will give you a clear idea of how to present your impact.\n‍\nAchievements examples for Students\nWhen you’re a student, you may have limited work experience—or none at all—because you’re focusing on your education. And that’s okay! That’s perfectly appropriate for this time of your life.\nThere are still ways to highlight your professional accomplishments, such as including GPA, academic awards, and volunteering opportunities.\n‍\nAchievement examples for students\nMaintained a 3.8 GPA over four years\nReceived Best Innovative Scientist award\nVolunteered at Memorial Hospital, reading to sick children\nCreated a short film used at new student orientation\nLearned X,Y,Z programming languages\nCompleted a year abroad in Spain, becoming fluent in Spanish\n‍\nAchievement examples for new graduates\nGraduating is such an exciting milestone. It’s the end of one chapter and the start of another. But it can also be daunting to join the so-called real world and jump head-first into the job market. Especially if you haven’t had many jobs. Here are some pre-career achievements worth considering:\n‍\nRecent graduate resume achievement examples\nGraduated with honors\nContributed to a successful launch of a new product during a marketing internship for [employer]\nOrganized the end-of-year fundraising drive for the Arts Department, leading to $20,000 in donations\nPresented original research at the Future of Biology conference\nCompleted training to become a certified crisis counselor at the Crisis Text Line\nWorked part-time at the Office of Student Affairs supporting students, while attending school full-time and maintaining a 3.9 GPA\n‍\nAchievement examples for management\nExperienced managers likely have a range of achievements to consider adding to their resume. The key is to choose the most potent ones that relate to the job description for the role you want.\n‍\nResume achievement examples for managers \nIdentified new revenue streams and increased profits by 40% in 18 months\nIncreased retention rates by 50% in two years after implementing new employee programs\nReduced $500,000 budget by 15% by streamlining vendor relationships\nManaged a team of 23 agents working collaboratively with other departments\nElevated new employees’ skills through career development initiatives, reducing project completion time by 30%\nMaintained a roster of clients with an average of 93% customer satisfaction for five years\n‍\nAchievements examples for sales\nIf you’re in sales, you likely know how to sell products. But with resume accomplishments, you need to sell yourself. It may not feel comfortable, but the good news is sales is a metric-heavy industry, so you have recorded data in your CRM to pull from. \n‍\nResume achievements examples for sales\nGenerated $600,000 in revenue over the past year for a new product\nCreated upselling protocols, increasing the average transaction by 23% in six months\nTrained five new sales consultants in three months, resulting in a 200% increase in sales\nTransitioned to a new CRM, reducing reporting errors by 20%\nEstablished major partnerships, increasing brand visibility and boosting sales by 37%\nIncreased closing rate by 41% in two years\n‍\nAchievement examples for nonprofits\nNonprofit employees work in a range of industries.

This makes it easier for a hiring manager to scan and focus on your past experiences and accomplishments.Here’s a breakdown of what you need for each section:\n‍\nProfessional summary\nYour professional summary should include 1-2 of your top accomplishments with impact. Focus on those that have driven results in the way the company is looking for.\n‍\nWork experience\nWhen it comes to work experience, your most recent position should have three to five bullet points. Older positions, or ones that aren’t as relevant, may only have a couple or none at all. This can help draw the most attention to your most recent, relevant roles and avoid lengthy, wordy resumes. \n‍\nPro Tip: Teal's Resume Bullet Point Generator can help arrange achievements easily and effectively in an order that makes sense for the job you’re applying to.\n‍\nCover letter\nWhile not part of your resume, your cover letter is part of your application package. Here, you don’t want to just repeat everything in your resume. Instead, focus on highlighting one or two key achievements that demonstrate why you're the best fit for a specific role. \nBe sure to use your cover letter to provide context, explaining how these accomplishments align with the company's needs and the JD.\n‍\nIncluding awards in your resume achievements\nYour resume achievements section should convey how you’ve tangibly contributed to the company. But should you include awards on a resume?\nIf you’re a recent graduate or have taken a break it can make sense to include awards on a resume. Additionally, if the award is related to your career, it can add more credibility and prestige to your work experience.\nAdd an awards section to your resume and include relevant information. Teal’s Resume Builder lets users incorporate awards into a resume with an easy-to-use template.\nAdd relevant awards and scholarships to bolster your resume achievements\n‍\nSimply add the award, organization, and the date received. Then hit “Save” to complete the process and add to your resume. \n‍\nWhy resume achievements matter\nOne of the most common resume mistakes is not being specific. The vast majority of job seekers who simply repeat the duties on their job description won’t move forward. But you can make moves to stand out to hiring managers by highlighting the specific things you’ve done. \nSpeaking to your achievements in your resume summary and work experience sections can bring your job duties to life and show more of your characteristics, skills, and abilities. It not only shows that you did your job, but also that you did some parts of it very well.\nTo get started, use Teal's AI-powered Resume Builder to help you write, format, and arrange your achievements and better tailor your resume to specific job descriptions.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow can I quantify achievements in my resume if my role was not sales or target-driven?\nWhat are examples of achievements on a resume?\nHow do you identify your top 5 achievements?\nHow do you put your achievements in your resume?"}}]}

And getting it right can significantly increase your chances of landing an interview.\nBelow, you'll learn how to write a targeted resume by identifying the most relevant details, aligning your experience with key job requirements, and optimizing your presentation to confidently present yourself as the most qualified candidate.\n‍\nStruggling to create a targeted resume quickly and with confidence? Sign up for Teal's Resume Builder for the tools and guidance to simplify crafting a standout tailored resume.\n‍\nWhat is a targeted resume?\nA targeted resume is a customized version of your resume that highlights your skills and experiences that align with the requirements of a specific job description.\nThe idea is to show a recruiter or hiring manager you have the qualifications they're looking for rather than just providing a general overview of your career. A targeted resume shows how your background makes you an ideal fit by selectively emphasizing relevant qualifications and de-emphasizing less pertinent details.\n‍\nWho should use a targeted resume?\nA targeted resume is important for any job seeker looking to stand out as qualified. \nWhether you're applying for your first job or aiming for a higher position in your field, tailoring your resume every time you hit apply ensures your most relevant skills and experiences are what hiring managers see.\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of some job seekers who can benefit from a targeted resume:\n‍\nRecent graduates\nWith limited work experience, a targeted resume allows recent graduates to show potential and adaptability as entry-level candidates. It emphasizes relevant coursework, internships, and projects directly related to the role they're applying for.\n‍\nSeasoned professionals\nWith a more extensive work history and expertise, a targeted resume allows experienced professionals to tailor their qualifications and achievements to align with specific job requirements—showcasing years of relevant experience, impact, and industry-specific accomplishments.\n‍\nCareer pivoters\nFor professionals making a career change, a targeted resume highlights how existing skills and knowledge can be applied to a new field or industry—showcasing adaptability and commitment to learning.\n‍\nDream job applicants\nA targeted resume makes a lasting impression when applying for a dream job. It precisely matches skills and experiences with the role's qualifications and expectations, demonstrating passion and dedication and increasing the chances of standing out.\nWrite Your Targeted Resume Now\n‍\nWhy do you need a targeted resume?\nYou need a targeted resume because it speaks directly to an employer's specific needs and expectations rather than offering a generic, general summary of your career.\nThink about it this way: an employer has a problem, a gap in their team—a role that requires specific skills and expertise. You have the skills needed to fill this gap. But unless your resume clearly positions you as the solution to their problem, the employer might not realize you're the right fit.\nTargeted resumes also make it easier for recruiters to find you in applicant tracking systems (ATS) when they search these digital filing systems for specific criteria. Strategic alignment not only boosts your chances of being found but also highlights your experience as relevant and compelling for human hiring professionals.\n‍\nAdvantages of target resumes\nHighlights your experience relevant to the role\n‍A targeted resume emphasizes your strengths as experiences that directly align with a specific job posting. This makes it clear to hiring managers why you're a perfect fit.\n‍\nHelps you stand out\n‍A targeted resume helps you stand out by incorporating keywords and phrases from the job description.\nThis does two things:\nImproves your visibility in applicant tracking systems (ATS) when hiring professionals search for specific criteria. \nIncreases the likelihood of being invited for an interview over other candidates because your resume clearly illustrates relevant skills and experiences and showcases your understanding of the role.\n‍\nMakes a strong first impression\n‍A targeted resume streamlines your professional details, focusing only on relevant information.\nBy eliminating non-essential elements, your resume will be cleaner and easier to read, improving its digestibility and making a strong first impression.\nThis approach also allows you to craft a compelling story about your career journey that's directly tailored to the job ad—enabling hiring managers to quickly understand the logical progression of your career and how uniquely qualified you are for the position.\n‍\nSaves Time\n‍While creating a targeted resume requires time to understand and align your experience with each job's requirements, this upfront effort pays off by speeding up subsequent applications.\nOnce you have a strong base resume, you can quickly make minor adjustments to tailor it to different roles. This focused approach allows you to apply at scale, knowing that each resume you send is optimized for success. \nBy increasing your chances of getting noticed by hiring managers quickly, a targeted resume also potentially reduces the length of your job search—ultimately saving you even more time in the long run.\n‍\nCreate a targeted resume with Teal\nWant to create targeted resumes for every application in less time with more confidence you're getting it right?\nTeal's Resume Job Description Match compares your resume to any job description and gives you a score that tells you how closely your experience aligns with that job—think of it like a resume keyword scanner.\nNeed to improve your score? Teal's Job Description Keyword Finder will help you cut through the noise and identify the skills and language that matter most so you can add more of the right details to increase your alignment!\nGet Your Resume Match Score\n‍\n‍\nShould you target your resume for each job application?\nYes, you should target your resume for each application. Why? Well, just like no two jobs are the exact same (even if they have the same job title), no two resumes should be the same either.\nTailoring your resume for each application shows potential employers that you've carefully considered how your skills and experiences align with the specific requirements of their job.\nThis personalized approach not only helps your resume get found in the ATS with the right keywords but also ensures you stand out from those using generic resumes. By customizing your content, you demonstrate attention to detail and a genuine interest in the role.\n‍\nThe advantage of a targeted resume in applicant tracking systems\nMany companies use applicant tracking systems (ATS) as digital filing systems to organize large volumes of job applications.\nThese systems can be searched for specific keywords and phrases that align with the job descriptions, helping human hiring professionals narrow the pool of applicants based on specific criteria.\n‍\nHere are three ways a targeted resume gives you an advantage with ATS:\nKeyword optimization: By strategically including keywords from the job listing, your resume is more likely to be found during searches conducted by hiring professionals.\nImproved scan-ability: ATS requires resumes to be formatted in ways that are easy to scan and parse. A targeted resume that is cleanly formatted without any unnecessary details.\nBetter searchability and relevance: A resume that mirrors the language and priorities of the job description not only aligns better with potential ATS searches but also signals to human hiring managers that your professional experience is directly applicable to the role.\n‍\nHow to write a targeted resume\nNow that you know what a targeted resume is, why it's important, and who should use one, here's how to create one.\n‍\n‍\n1.) Identify the type of job you're applying for\nStart by determining the specific job type you are interested in. But don't just identify a target job title. Look at industry trends that align with your skills and career goals. Understanding the broader category of the job will help you narrow down specific opportunities and tailor your resume to fit the general expectations of such roles.\n‍\n2.) Review the job description carefully\nOnce you have a specific job posting in mind, take the time to review the job description thoroughly.\nPay close attention to the hard and soft skills, qualifications, and experiences listed as requirements or preferences.\nHighlight keywords and phrases that are repeatedly mentioned or seem to carry particular importance. These are likely the terms hiring managers will search for in the ATS.\n‍\nPro Tip: The Teal Resume Builder and Job Application Tracker pull the top five keywords from any job description—saving you time and effort. Teal+ members have unlimited keywords for every job description, so you're never left guessing what language you should include for a specific position.\nGet Job Description Keywords\n‍\n3.) Align each resume section with the job description\nCreating a resume that aligns precisely with a job description means each part of your resume speaks directly to the needs of the employer.\nHere's how to write a target resume section by section:\n‍\nMatch your target title\nYour resume title (or headline) should match the job description as closely as possible, as long as it accurately reflects your experience. This alignment helps position you as a direct fit for the role from the onset.\n‍\nTweak your professional summary\nYour professional summary is your highlight reel. Use it to focus on your most notable achievements.\nIn your summary, include 1-3 of the top skills listed in the job description and demonstrate their impact with specific metrics. This not only shows your qualifications but also your proven success in relevant areas.\n‍\nFocus on achievements aligning with the job description\nYour resume bullet points should always be relevant to the role you're applying for.\nFor example, if you're applying for an engineering position, emphasize engineering achievements with quantifiable results to showcase your impact rather than your college internship in a data science role.  \n‍\nInclude relevant education and certifications\nList only the educational qualifications and certifications that are pertinent to the job. For instance, if a certification in a specific software is listed in the role you are applying for, include it; otherwise, omit non-relevant certifications.\n‍\nAdd pertinent projects or volunteer experience\nIncorporate any projects or volunteer experiences that demonstrate skills and knowledge applicable to the job. This additional information can provide a fuller picture of your capabilities and commitment.\n‍\nIncorporate relevant keywords\nUse targeted keywords throughout your resume—within the summary, achievements, skills section, education, and projects. This strategic inclusion ensures your resume is optimized for both ATS searches and human reviewers.\n‍\nFor example, let's say a specific job opening focuses on SEO copywriting and specific technical skills like AHREFS, Google Analytics, and Amplitude. If you have this experience, take just a few minutes to add it to your resume sections by:\nIncorporating each skill or tool once\nDetailing the results you achieved with each\nThis strategy helps your resume align with the position description and highlights your proficiency with the tangible outcomes of your work.\n‍\nProofread for alignment\nFinally, proofread your resume meticulously to ensure it is not only free of errors but also perfectly aligned with the job requirements. Use a resume scoring tool (like Teal's Job Description Match). This attention to detail can make a significant difference in how your application is perceived.\n‍\nTargeted resume examples\nBelow, you'll see two targeted resume examples. These focus on unique job types and showcase a variety of experiences aligned with the targeted role.\n‍\n‍\nWhy this resume is well-targeted\nThis resume is well-targeted for a graphic design position at a company that values innovation in digital design. Luca's target title aligns with the role he's applying for. His focus on leadership in website redesign highlights his ability to deliver impactful results, increasing web traffic and sales. Luca's expertise with design tools like Figma and Adobe also aligns seamlessly with the technical skills required for a mid-level role within a technology-driven brand, making him a strong candidate.\n‍\nTargeted resume sample - frontend developer\n\nWhy this resume is well-targeted\nOlivia's resume is a great targeted resume example for a frontend developer position at a progressive tech company looking for a candidate with 2+ years of experience. Her detailed work experience, highlighting specific achievements like reducing page load speeds by 20% and increasing user experience scores, directly aligns with job requirements that prioritize efficiency and user satisfaction. Olivia's academic credentials from the Harvard Institute of Technology in Computer Science are prominently featured, aligning with the required educational qualifications listed in the job description.\n‍\nFor more examples of targeted resumes, check out this comprehensive list of resume examples to use for inspiration.\n‍\nTargeted resume template\nHere's a structured, targeted resume template that you can use, designed to be filled in with personal details, experience, and skills tailored to the job description (JD):\n‍\n[Full Name]\n[City, State]\n[Email Address]\n[Phone Number]\n[LinkedIn Profile URL]\n‍\n[Target Job Title You're Applying For]\n‍\nProfessional Summary:\nAs an experienced [Title] with [X] years in the [Industry or Specialty Field], I have [Skill 1 from the JD] to [Achieve Metric/Impact].

They can see hundreds in a single day, even if they’re using an ATS.\nTo get through them, they’ve created procedures to prioritize the best-fit candidates. \nThat’s why, if you’re going to email your resume directly to a recruiter, that email has to catch their eye. It has to be appealing enough to get them to willingly review yet another resume.\n‍\nIn this article, you’ll learn how to craft the perfect sample resume to send to a recruiter. You can also speed up the process and keep track of the jobs you’ve already applied for using Teal’s Job Tracker and Email Templates.\nStruggling to keep up with communication? Try Teal’s email templates in the free Job Application Tracker.\n‍\nHow to write an email with your resume to a recruiter\nIn most cases, if you’re sending your resume to a recruiter it’s because:\nThey’ve reached out to you, either on LinkedIn or through email, to express interest in your background and your fit for the role. \nThey list their email in the job posting, asking for resumes in their inbox rather than in an application.\nYou’ve discussed work with someone on social media, in-person, or another medium and they’ve asked you to send your resume.\nIn the first case, recruiters are sending out dozens of canned messages to all candidates within their database, or within a LinkedIn search. They often have a list of criteria they’re using to run this search, and you just happen to fit within that data set.\nThey know the more emails they send out, the more likely they are to get a response and, hopefully, find the right candidate within those responses. \nIn both the first and second scenarios, recruiters are seeing a lot of emails from a lot of people. That is why you shouldn’t send your resume to a recruiter until you are sure it’s a decent match for your skills, work history, and interests for your next role.\nLearn as much about the role as you can first. When you feel secure enough to send your resume, you can send it with confidence.\nOnce you’re ready, here’s how to email a resume to a recruiter:\n‍\nStep 1: The subject line for a resume email\nYour subject line is your first impression, and if it’s too generic, it’ll be completely ignored. An anonymous recruiter on a hiring forum made this clear, stating: \n“As someone who has seen a ton of these, I 100 percent do not suggest something generic. It's quite obvious from some people that they sent the same email to several people. These emails get ignored 90 percent of the time unless the hiring manager is desperate. As for the title, I suggest [you] to be very clear in what you are looking for, even if it's a little long. Example: \"Expression of interest for XX-0X Position - [group name, ex: Policy Division] - Seeking Deployment Opportunity.\"\n‍\nThat’s why your email subject line needs to be a clear indicator of these few things:\nWho you are (name)\nThe role you’re applying for\nYour qualifications, if applicable (MBA, CP, Ph.D…)\nEmail subject lines are rather short, even on a desktop (60 characters at most), but they’re even shorter in mobile inboxes. \nYou need to be clear not only about why you’re reaching out, but also put the most important words at the beginning to ensure they’re seen. \n‍\nSample subject line in an email to send to a recruiter\nIf you’re referred to by someone, that’s what you should include first. The subject line, in that case, might look something like this:\n‍\nIf you weren’t referred, here are a few other examples of email subject lines to a recruiter:\nNotice of Interest - [Job title you seek]\nApplying for [Position] – [Name] Resume\n“[Job title][Your name],[Your qualification or job title]\n‍\nStep 2: Greeting\nKeep your greeting simple and professional with a “Hello” or “Dear” followed by their first name. \nJust be sure to spell it correctly. They won’t take kindly to being called something other than their name, especially when you can generally just look at their email to ensure correct spelling. Check their LinkedIn profile if you are unsure.\n‍\nStep 3: Introduction\nThe introduction of your email is the first line after your greeting, and it’s really more of a courtesy than anything else.\nYou don’t need to draw it out. One or two sentences explaining why you’re reaching out and how you found out about the opportunity is adequate, especially if you were referred to the role. If you were, be sure to name drop.\nIf you really want to stand out from the standard email though, get straight to your message and express your enthusiasm for the position with something that stands out. \n‍\n‍\nStep 4: Qualifications and value proposition in your email body\nDon’t just list your qualifications in your email as if it’s a resume. Instead, share the biggest highlights of your career in a conversational tone.\nThe best way to do this is to think through the outcomes you’ve produced in your position. If the role you’re applying for, or the roles you’ve had in the past, are not outcome based, consider how your work contributed to business goals. \nMaybe you’ve led a team that completed a detrimental project for the company. Maybe you’ve saved the company money somehow or increased the efficiency of an internal process. \nIf former or current employers have benefited from your work in any way, share that. Then, of course, also share any certifications or earned titles, such as Ph.D.\n‍\n‍\nThis works because it’s straightforward. Instead of oversharing, it dives right into the  results of past work. It wastes no time delivering the essential details that’ll help the recruiter make a decision.\nPro tip: Teal’s Job Tracker includes job application email templates tailored to your resume and cover letter.\nAccess Job Search Email Templates\n‍\n‍\nStep 5: Call to Action\nPoint the reader in the direction you want them to take with confidence. Don’t leave it open-ended. \nFor example, “please let me know if I’m a good fit” is too passive.\nInstead, you want to be more assertive to earn the hiring manager's attention, urging them into action without coming across as entitled or pushy.\n‍\nSample call to action in an email to send to a recruiter\n“Please see my resume attached to the link in my portfolio [URL] to check my samples and testimonials. My resume is also attached to this email.\n\nIf I look like a fit, I'd love the opportunity to speak with you further on how I can apply my skills to [outcome] for [Company]. I'm available all Tuesday and Wednesday next week. Would you be up for a chat?”\n‍\nStep 6: Best resume email closings and sign-offs\nAfter asking for a meeting or closing with another call to action, thank the recruiter for their time and consideration. \nSign off your email with a professional closing, such as \"Best regards,\" \"Sincerely,\" or \"Thank you.\"\nInclude your full name, contact information, and any relevant links (such as your LinkedIn profile) in your email signature.\nThere are a few websites that make it easy to create a professional email signature. \n‍\nSample signature in an email to send to a recruiter\n‍\nYou simply have to go into your email settings, to your signature, and paste your professional email signature there. From then on, every email you create will automatically include your signature. \n‍\nStep 7: Attaching your resume to a recruiter email\nA lot of job applicants question whether or not they should email their resume as a word doc or a PDF file. \nA PDF has long been thought of as the clean and professional standard. They also have the advantage of maintaining your formatting, so recruiters will always see your resume as intended. \nBut recently Word docs have been making a come back due to fears that ATS software isn’t able to read PDFs. \nHowever, as long as the text in the PDF isn't rasterized or cluttered with images and icons, an ATS should be able to read it. \n‍\nAnnette Marie, a job seeker, shared this word of caution about using PDF resumes with additional graphics for job applications:\n“The entire top portion of my PDF resume did not appear in the finished ATS scan, but everything appeared when I scanned my Word document (.docx). However, it’s worth mentioning that the top portion of my resume is within a text box, which may explain the issue.\n\nJust be cautious with shapes and objects, as they don’t seem to be compatible when using a PDF format. Nonetheless, the PDF still presents well for in-person interviews.”\n‍\nRecruiters may sometimes favor Word doc resumes due to their ability to make changes, either to the formatting, or to remove certain items that might lead to unconscious bias (such as a picture).\nSome recruiters might also need to remove contact information in order to protect your details and keep their clients from contacting you directly. \nBut you’d have to be willing to have a recruiter alter your resume, potentially without consulting you. \nUnless they’re a career coach, a trusted friend, or a resume writing service, no one should be editing your resume. \n‍\nStep 8: Follow up on your recruiter email\nThere are several ways to follow up on a job application email, because, no, you don’t necessarily have to follow up via email.\nEmail: It’s rare for recruiters to get through all of their emails in one sitting, so it might take a few days to get to yours. But, if you haven’t heard back in a couple of days, it’s safe to send an email reasserting your interest in the position.\nAside from re-expressing your interest, you might also want to ask when you’ll be able to connect with a hiring manager. You can also reattach your resume and cover letter. \n‍\nSample follow up job application email template\nSubject line: [Your Name] - Job Application Follow-up for [Position] at [Company]\n\nHello [Hiring Manager's Name],\n\nA few weeks ago, I applied for the [Position Title with Hyperlink to the Application] role at [Company Name]. I'm very excited about this opportunity, so I wanted to reach out, introduce myself, and see if you have any details from the hiring manger about the decision timeline.\n\nI'm a [Your Current Job Title] at [Your Current Company Name] who's [insert relevant qualifications and/or accomplishments] over the last [X] years.\n\nIn particular, I'm interested in [Company Name] because [mention specific reasons why you're interested and why you’re a good fit].\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about my application or require further information from me. I look forward to hearing from you soon and learning more about the timeline. I can't wait to share some of my ideas on [insert challenge or goal related to your desired new job title].\n\n[Best/Kind regards/Thank you],\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Phone Number]\n[Your LinkedIn]\nTry Teal Today For More Job Search Templates\n‍\nPhone: Resort to a phone call only after you haven’t heard back on your follow-up email. \nLinkedIn: Try to avoid reaching out to a recruiter on LinkedIn unless that was their initial method of contacting you. The reason? It’s far more informal and some recruiters only use their LinkedIn for personal use, or may not check it regularly. \nHere’s a simple follow-up LinkedIn message template: \nDear [Contact Name],\n\nI recently submitted my application for the [Position] at [Company], and I wanted to follow up to express my continued interest in the opportunity and inquire about the status of my application.\n\nI am excited about the possibility of joining the team at [Company], and I believe my skills and experience make me a strong fit for the [Position]. I am confident that my [mention of relevant skills, qualifications or experiences] would contribute to the success of the team and the company.\n\nIf there are any additional materials or information I can provide to support my application, please let me know. I am eager to further discuss my qualifications and how I can contribute to the success of [Company].\n\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Phone Number]\n‍\nNote: Within Teal’s Job Application Tracker, you’ll find job application email templates to get your started in crafting a personalized email to a recruiter.\n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid when sending your resume via email\nMost emails sent to a recruiter are canned—a template or exact copy of an email sent again and again with little to no alterations. And recruiters are sick of it. \nJules Lalo, a recruiter, echoes this when with this statement:\n“One of my pet peeves is a CV with no context [in the email] intro [so] I have to decipher what group level they are substantively. This has a huge impact on filtering later on.”\nIn other words, recruiters aren’t just asking for more details and personalization from you because they don’t like it. They simply need more details to help place you in a role or ensure you’re a right fit (and they want to be able to find your email later).\nBut a lack of context isn’t the only mistake many job seekers make when sending a job application email. Here are a few common mistakes recruiters see: \n‍\nUsing an unprofessional email address\nElby James, a former HR associate and resume consultant, finds it shocking how often people send emails from unprofessional email addresses. \n“The email address should be a professional email address. I don't mind Gmail or AOL but really, how much does it cost to buy a domain name today? Especially when it is for something as important as your career.\nI remember seeing email addresses such as hottotrot123@gmail.com. hotty00765@aol.com. callmemaybebaby25@aol.com. ”\n‍\nSpelling errors on your resume or in the email \nSpelling mistakes won’t be a make or break for all recruiters, but it can be a put off for many, especially in a short email. With tools like Grammarly available today, most recruiters don’t take kindly to spelling mistakes. \n‍\nElby shares his thoughts on this as well:\n“I abhor typos. Maybe this is the graduate English major inside of me acting out but really, there is no need for typos; there are two reasons I say this: The first reason is spell check… it’s free! The second reason is [that] a resume is an important document, you should check it as many times as possible.”\n‍\nTry to avoid buzzwords\nYou might be keyword stuffing your resume to get into the candidate pool, but you shouldn’t apply that same logic to a recruiter email. And really, you should try to avoid overstuffing your resume as well. \nWhy? \nRecruiters will often use keyword stuffing as a mental filter. They’ll automatically toss any resume or email that overly-uses buzzwords.\nThey need to be able to tell what you do in the simplest of terms and with a quick glance. But if you’re using phrases like—“transformed big-thinking into actionable steps, aligning with business goals and channel objectives”—no one will understand you. \nPro tip: Teal’s free Resume Job Description Match tool helps you optimize your resume for a specific job based on the top keywords in the description. Use this to highlight the important words to align yourself as a great fit.\n‍\n‍\nLack of personalization\nIt doesn’t take a lot to personalize an email to a recruiter. \nYou’ll keep most of the details the same, like your qualifications and your call to action. But you’ll alter the company’s name, the recruiter’s name, and details about how you found out about the role. \nYou’ll also want to alter anything pertinent to the role itself, such as how your experience applies. This isn’t the same for every role, and it’s very easy to tell if you aren’t paying attention to those differences. \nRecruiters want to know exactly how you fit that role, without digging. \n‍\nStart with a sample email to send a resume to a recruiter\nAs you may have caught on, recruiters see hundreds of resumes. They’re unsurprised by most stylings or attempts to be unique. But they’re far more numb to the generic resume emails they see all day.\nSo while it’s important to add personalization, get straight to your point, and include only the most compelling details in your email, you still need an email template to get started.\nWhile recruiters may see a lot of emails, there’s truth to the job search being a numbers game. The longer you spend on one email, the longer you might be searching for a role. You might even miss out on some opportunities because you’re spending too much time on emailing a recruiter that will spend only seconds determining whether or not to put you in a candidate pool.\nUsing a sample resume email for recruiters as a template, you can speed up the process while adding some personalization. \nTo find simple, but effective job application email templates, try Teal’s AI Resume Builder. email templates to send your  to recruiters and hiring managers.\n‍\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat should you write in an email when sending a resume to a recruiter?\nWhat should you write when sending a CV via email?\nWhat should you write in an email subject line when sending a resume?","URL Slug":"sample-email-send-resume"}}]}

For some job seekers, the hybrid resume offers the perfect balance—but it's not for everyone.\nA hybrid resume format focuses on skills and experience, giving you the flexibility to present yourself as a well-rounded candidate with a focus on your technical aptitudes. But when is the hybrid resume your best bet, and when should you stick with a more traditional format?\nIn this guide, you'll learn who should use a hybrid resume, how it compares to others, like the functional resume format and reverse-chronological resume, and how to write a hybrid resume using Teal’s AI Resume Builder.\n‍\nNeed to write a hybrid resume? Make one quickly in Teal's AI Resume Builder today.\n‍\nWhat is a hybrid resume?\nThe hybrid resume, also known as a combination resume, provides a balanced mix of showcasing experiences and skills. It's a versatile resume format that blends elements from functional and the chronological resume format styles—combining both approaches.\n‍\nTypically, a hybrid resume begins with a summary of your qualifications, followed by a Skills section. This allows you to highlight your most relevant capabilities immediately.\nThe next resume section details work experience, emphasizing achievements and impact that align with desired skills. This structured approach ensures that a potential employer quickly grasps your value.\n‍\nHere’s the ordered structure of a typical hybrid resume:\nContact details\nTarget title\nProfessional summary\nHard or technical skills\nWork experience\nEducation\nCertifications\nOther optional sections\nListing qualifications and skills near the top without overemphasizing skills or skipping details about experience enables you to promote relevant skills for the job—while still providing enough insight into your work history.\n‍\nWho should use a hybrid resume?\nWhat types of job seekers would benefit from the hybrid resume?\nIf your career path has been unconventional, your recent work history doesn't fully align with your next opportunity, or you have specialized skills that are highly valued, a combination resume can help. It allows you to highlight relevant qualifications upfront while still showcasing your experience.\n‍\nA hybrid resume best suits:\nThose whose work experience is not very extensive\nThose with unique qualifications and skills that are important for a particular job\n‍\nBelow are some examples of different kinds of job seekers who can consider the hybrid resume format:\nCareer changers: If you're transitioning to a new field, a hybrid resume allows you to emphasize transferable skills while still presenting relevant work history.\nTech or finance workers: Many tech and high-finance jobs require unique capabilities and diverse skill sets. A hybrid resume can effectively showcase your competencies.\nNew graduates: Recent grads may lack extensive work experience but have valuable skills and projects to highlight. The hybrid format helps balance these aspects.\nJob hunters with employment gaps: Those with gaps can use the hybrid format to focus on skills acquired during those periods as well as any relevant work experience.\n‍\nPros and cons of a hybrid resume\nLike any resume format, the hybrid resume comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.\nPros of a hybrid resume\nCombines skills and experience for a complete overview.\nAllows flexibility to tailor for specific jobs.\nHighlights key skills relevant to the position.\nCons of a hybrid resume\nCan become too long by including both detailed skills and work history.\nRequires careful planning to balance the skills and experience sections.\nOverloading skills might downplay key work achievements.\n‍\nHybrid vs. functional resume\nA hybrid resume and a functional resume emphasize skills, but in different ways.\nThe functional resume places skills at the forefront, prioritizing them over work history. This format is often used by job seekers with strong skill sets who may have gaps in their work history or are changing industries.\nIn contrast, while a hybrid resume allows you to highlight important skills at the top, it also includes a robust work history section, ensuring that a hiring manager can still graphs your experience.\n‍\nHybrid vs. reverse-chronological resume\nThe reverse-chronological resume is focused primarily on work experience, listing past jobs in reverse order with detailed descriptions of each role. Skills, while included, are typically secondary in this format.\nThe below table summarizes the main differences between the hybrid, functional and reverse-chronological resume formats to help you determine which format is best suited for the circumstances of your job search.\n\n‍\n‍\nHow to create a hybrid resume\nCreating a hybrid resume involves a few strategic steps to ensure it is both impactful and concise.\nHere are the different steps of how to easily create a hybrid resume in Teal’s AI Resume Builder.\n‍\nStep 1: Use a hybrid resume template\nA resume template will help you streamline the resume writing—no matter which format you choose. Templates ensure consistency in structure and presentation, allowing you to focus on content.\nTeal offers customizable resume templates that can help you get started. (You can also arrange your resume sections in the order that works best for your exprience with Teal's flexible design options.)\nStart building your resume using a template for easy formatting\n‍\nStep 2: Start with contact Information and target title\nBegin with the basics and fill out your contact information and list your target job title.\nIn Teal, you can save multiple target titles and easily swap them out to customize your resume to particular job postings with unique titles.\nStart with contact info and target titles\n‍\nStep 3: Add relevant skills\nInclude a skills section immediately after the summary. Use bullet points to list relevant skills, ensuring they match the job description. Be specific—mention tools, technologies or methodologies you excel in.\nA strong Skills section helps to clarify your experiences, complement your work history and highlight technical proficiency so you can stand out to employers.\nAdd top skills to your hybrid resume Skills section\n‍\nStep 4: Detail your work experience\nNext, list your work experience in reverse-chronological order. For each position, include job title, company and dates of employment. Use bullet points to describe responsibilities and achievements, focusing on those that demonstrate your skills.\nA great Work Experience section validates your claims you can actually do the job you’re applying for. It also demonstrates the relevance of your work history and shows your career progression to highlight increased roles and responsibilities.\nPro Tip: With Teal, you can use generative AI to optimize bullet points for each job and showcase your work history in the best light for hiring managers.\nWrite from scratch or opt for generative AI to summarize your work history\n‍\nStep 5: Customize resume sections\nAfter adding details about education and any certifications, customize the structure of your resume so certain sections stand out the way you want them to.\nFor instance, since a hybrid resume places skills on top of experience, in Teal, you can adjust the section order with simple-to-use drag-and-drop features in the Resume Builder’s Design tab.\n‍\n‍\nHybrid resume template\nIf you want to opt out of using a resume builder, below is a copy-paste text template of the different sections of a hybrid resume, including the typical section order and information to include, to help you build a hybrid resume.\n‍\nHeader and Contact Info\n[Name]\n[Address], [Phone Number], [Email Address]\n[Website] (Optional), [LinkedIn] (Optional), [Social Media] (Optional)\nTarget Job Title\n[Title that aligns with the JD]\nProfessional Summary\n[Objective/Qualifications]\nSkills\n[Skills Summary] (Optional)\n[Skill Category], [Skill 1], [Skill 2], [Skill 3]\n[Skill Category], [Skill 1], [Skill 2], [Skill 3]\nWork Experience\n[Company Name], [Dates]\n[Job Title]\n[City] (Optional)\n[Job Description / Bullet Point]\n[Bullet Point]\n[Bullet Point]\nEducation\n[Degree], [Field]\n[School Name], [Location], [Dates]\nCertifications\n[Certification Name], [Dates]\n[Certification Issuer]\n‍\n\nHybrid resume examples\nLet’s look at three hybrid resume examples. These hybrid resume samples provide a sense of what a typical hybrid resume looks like and when to use one in your job search.\n1. Example of a hybrid resume for an Azure Cloud engineer\n‍\nA hybrid resume example for showcasing technical skills\n‍\nThis hybrid resume example helps showcase unique technical skills for a unique tech job.\nIn this hybrid resume sample, the applicant is a software engineer who specializes in Azure, a cloud-computing service from Microsoft.\nSince the job requires uniquely advanced technical skills relevant to Microsoft Azure, the candidate showcases them above their work experience and even highlights key results they previously achieved from applying these specific skills.\nAnd because they have a few years of relevant work experience, they opt for the hybrid resume instead of the functional resume to still delineate some details from their last couple of jobs—helping to round out their resume overall.\n‍\n2. Finance director example hybrid resume\nAn example of a hybrid resume for limited work experience\n‍\nThis hybrid resume example helps make up for only a couple of years of relevant work experience by frontloading the skills section.\nThis resume for an Assistant Finance Director is a great example of a hybrid resume.\nThe applicant emphasizes their skills unique for a finance job, categorizing them into sections and demonstrating how those skills have generated applicable results.\nWith only a couple of years of relevant work experience, the applicant decided to go with the hybrid resume over the reverse-chronological resume to try to move up in their career while avoiding the functional resume still to demonstrate a sufficient baseline in their work history.\n‍\n3. Hybrid resume example entry-level product manager\nA hybrid resume example for an entry level position\n‍\nThis hybrid resume example for an entry-level position as a full-time product manager is ideal when trying to transition from an internship to a full-time job in a new field.\nProduct management requires specific skill sets such as communication, market research, and project-management skills, so in this sample resume, the applicant tries to stand out by frontloading qualifications and outlining certain skills in the Professional Summary section at the top.\nBut the hybrid format works here because, on the one hand, the applicant has no experience in product management outside of an internship and, on the other hand, they still have some work experience worth discussing to help stand out against new graduates with no experience.\n‍\nBuild your hybrid resume with Teal\nBy blending skills and work experience, the hybrid format provides a well-rounded view of your qualifications, making it easier to stand out to potential employers.\nWhether you're a career changer, a new grad with existing experience, or a seasoned professional looking to highlight more technical skills, a hybrid resume can be tailored for your needs.\nAnd Teal’s AI Resume Builder can make developing your hybrid resume faster and easier.\nTeal is designed to help you create a resume that highlights your unique skills and experiences in a way that aligns with your career progression. With design tools and an intuitive interface you can easily make your resume comprehensive and visually appealing—no matter what format you choose.\nUse Teal’s Resume Builder to create your hybrid resume with:\nCustomizable templates: Choose from various styles to best represent your professional image.\nDrag-and-drop editing: Easily modify, add, or rearrange sections on your resume.\nReal-time previews: View immediate changes to your resume as you edit.\nAI-powered writing suggestions: Get tailored recommendations to improve your resume’s content.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat are the disadvantages of a hybrid resume?\nHow to put hybrid work on a resume?\nWhat is an example of a hybrid objective on a resume?","URL Slug":"write-hybrid-resume-template"}}]}

CVs are often used in fields like academia, research, and international job applications, where a detailed understanding of your qualifications is needed.\nAll of that to say, companies (and even institutions) requesting CVs over a resume are looking for a more complete picture of your background.\n‍\n‍\nDifference between a CV and resume\nA CV and resume are different in length and scope.\nA resume is a concise, one to three-page, high-level summary focused on your most relevant skills and experiences for a specific job.\nIn contrast, a CV can be longer and include additional sections like research or presentations. The structure of a CV also varies with certain sections—like a Personal Statement replacing a resume's Professional Summary. \nYou should opt for a CV over a resume when applying for academic positions, research roles, grants or when specifically requested.\nIt's also important to note that even though a CV is more detailed when applying within the US, you should still emphasize the experiences and skills most relevant to the position.\n‍\n\n‍\n‍Essential elements of a CV\nIt's vital to include the right sections in your CV, as missing key info can weaken your application. A job-winning CV with clear, organized sections offers a holistic view of your qualifications. Missing parts might not provide a good picture of your experience.\nTo make sure your CV is strong (and competitive if you're using it for a job search), ensure it's thorough and covers all the necessary details.\n‍\nHere are the CV sections you need:\nContact Information\nPersonal Statement\nCareer Experience\nEducation\nCertifications\nSkills\nOptional sections:\nResearch\nTeaching Experience\nPublications and Presentations\nAwards\nProfessional Associations or Volunteer Work\n‍\n\n‍\nHow to write a CV\nWhether you're writing your CV from square one or updating an outdated document, streamlining this process all comes down to clear steps.\nBelow, you'll learn the right way to:\nPrepare for making a CV\nSelect a CV format\nPresent your contact info\nWrite your personal statement\nBuild your career experience \nFocus on your education and certifications\nInclude specific hard skills\nIncorporate other optional details\nNow, when it comes to how to write a CV, you can do this in one of two ways:\nCreate a base CV with every job, achievement, metric, skill, etc., which you then customize for each application by pulling the most relevant details.\nCreate your CV from scratch each time you apply, tailoring it specifically to the role you're targeting.\nWhile a base CV takes more time on the front end, it can help significantly cut the time it takes to apply for every unique job.\nFor ease, the content below is focused on creating your CV for a unique job—something you'll need to know how to do regardless of how you opt to build your CV.\n‍\n‍\nManaging multiple CVs\nAs you apply for different opportunities, you'll need to find the best way to manage multiple versions of your CV.\nAs each prospect requires a slightly different emphasis on your skills and experience, version control becomes not just important but crucial in managing multiple CVs.\nYou can do this in two ways:\nOpt to save each CV to a specific folder (whether on your computer or in a cloud). In addition to the unique CV, you need to manually save the JD or the overview so you know which CV goes with what opportunity.\nUse a comprehensive platform (Teal, for example) that allows you to save as many CVs and opportunities as you need to. You'll want to be sure the platform permits you to attach specific CVs to specific opportunities, so you've never left scrambling to remember what application materials you sent where.\n‍\nStep 1: Get organized\nGetting organized is crucial before you start writing your CV.  Here are four things to do before you start:\nGather career details: Make sure you have current and accurate company details, start and end dates, each job title, quantifiable contributions, and a list of skills.\nDocument education: Take note of schools attended, degrees earned, and all current certifications. If you're a recent graduate, jot down courses, awards (or qualifications if you're outside the US), your GPA, and projects.\nCompile online profiles: Create a list of online profiles, including LinkedIn, websites, or portfolio links.\nBuild your base: If you're planning on creating a base CV, you'd then put all of this information into a CV builder, doc, or CV template.\n‍\nStep 2: Choose your format\nThe layout of your CV is the foundation. The format you use helps shape the presentation of your experience.\nThe best CV formats ensure you highlight your qualifications clearly and thoroughly.\nHere are a few things to consider:\nThe most widely recognized format is the reverse chronological CV. It presents your career experience in a clear, linear progression.\nIf you're just starting out, pivoting careers, or working in an industry where tools and software are a focus, a skills-based CV might be appropriate, as the Skills section sits just above your Career Experience section.\nIn choosing your format, consider your career, what you're applying for, and which design best conveys your accomplishments.\n‍\nBest CV design\nYour CV presentation goes beyond content. The look, feel, and readability shape a first impression. As you make it, you need to consider elements like spacing, font, margins, and more. Traditionally CVs are also two columns, so planning for this is a must.\nIf you're using a CV builder, a lot of these pieces are considered and customizable after you've input your details—saving time and skipping manual work. But if you're building a CV outside of a streamlined builder, here are some tips:\nUse a template: Free CV templates help maintain a consistent format and make your CV visually appealing right from the start.\nKeep it clear: Clarity is key. Use simple fonts and consistent formatting to make your CV easy to read. Avoid overcrowding the page with text.\nInclude white space: Adequate spacing between sections makes your CV easier to scan and prevents it from looking cluttered.\nUse bullet points: Bullet points are a great way to highlight your professional success without a block of overwhelming text.\nOnce you've organized your assets, potentially uploaded them all in one central location (depending on the method you've chosen), and selected a format, it's time to learn how to write a CV for a specific job.\n‍\nStep 3: Add contact details\nThe first section is your Contact Information section. It might sound simple, but one wrong number or character in your email address could potentially prevent a committee, hiring manager, or recruiter from being able to reach you for a follow-up or job interview.\nYour CV Contact Information section sits at the top and should include:\nFull name\nPhone number\nCity and State (If you're outside the US, consider opting for your full physical address.)\nProfessional email address\nLinkedIn profile URL \nPortfolio or personal website URL (if applicable)\n‍\nExample of how to write a CV Contact section\nFull name as your CV header\n\nLocation | Phone number | Email address | LinkedIn URL | Portfolio or website URL\n‍\nStep 4: Write your personal statement\nYour personal statement (the equivalent of a resume professional summary) is a brief snapshot of your most impressive outcomes.\nRather than a CV objective that talks about your goals and isn't relevant in the US, this section is a highlight reel—zeroing in on top accomplishments, skills, and qualifications.\nYour personal statement should be tailored to the job application, using language and keywords from the job description to highlight your relevant skills, impact, and qualifications. \n‍\nHere's how to write one:\nKeep it brief; between three to five sentences\nUse the first-person voice\nUse action verbs that indicate movement. For example, words like \"developed\" and \"executed\"\nAvoid generic buzzwords or clichés\nAlign your statement with the rest of your CV\n\n‍\nWhen creating academic CVs, a personal statement might align more with a research statement or statement of teaching philosophy.\n‍\nHere's an academic CV example of a personal statement:\nWith 10+ years of experience in cognitive psychology, my teaching philosophy centers on fostering critical thinking and inclusivity. I developed a focused approach to research, executing over 10 studies using mixed-methods methodologies to explore cognitive development in diverse learning environments. This work resulted in three peer-reviewed publications and a 15% increase in student engagement through active learning strategies while mentoring over 20 graduate students in applying evidence-based research methods to their studies and professional growth.\n‍\nWriting a personal statement with no experience\nIf you're new to your career, writing a CV personal statement without relevant work experience means you need to concentrate on other achievements.\nConsider focusing on:\nCoursework with tangible skills\nProjects and the outcome\nRelevant volunteer experience\nLeadership roles in clubs or organizations\nCertifications you've obtained\nSoftware and tools you've used\n‍\nIf you're your personal statement with no experience, it could look something like the graduate CV example below.\nAs a recent biology graduate with a minor in statistics, I bring hands-on experience in cutting-edge genetic research techniques. While at Purdue, I developed a novel CRISPR gene editing approach that improved editing efficiency by 18% in model organisms. I'm proficient in PCR, gel electrophoresis, and next-generation sequencing, with practical application through advanced lab courses and a summer internship at Purdue's Genomics Center. I'm also experienced in research communication, having presented findings at two regional conferences and co-authored a peer-reviewed article on emerging gene therapy technologies.\n‍‍\nStep 5: Build your Career Experience section\nIf you're following reverse chronological order, next is your Career Experience section. This is the equivalent of a resume's Professional Experience. The job of this CV section is to bridge your background with the opportunity you're applying for—emphasizing your career's depth, relevance, and impact.\nHere's what you should focus on:\n‍\nRelevance\nEvery position and achievement you highlight should be relevant to the role.\nFor example, if you're applying for a research role in computational sciences, your experience in optimizing algorithms to reduce processing time by 40 percent would be highly relevant. However, the same experience might need different emphasis when applying for a professor position, where your ability to simplify complex concepts for college students would take priority.\"\n‍\nQuantifiable bullet points\nFocusing on metrics, numbers, and impact in your Career Experience section provides concrete evidence of your contributions. Quantifiable bullets demonstrate the actual difference you made in your roles.\nWhy metrics matter:\nProvide concrete evidence of success\nDemonstrate value\nShow clear impact\nThis can look like increased efficiency, time-savings, increase in publication rate, grant funding outcomes, and other measurable results.\n\n‍\nFormat\nThe core of your experience is your accomplishments and their impact. The best way to write each bullet is by using the following formula:\nAction Verb + Noun + Metric + [Optional Strategy] + Outcome = 1 bullet point\n‍\nHere are some CV examples of bullet points:\nDeveloped a data analysis pipeline using Python and Pandas that improved the accuracy of experimental results by 15%, leading to more reliable findings and 3X publications in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nDeveloped and implemented a laboratory management system using LabArchives that optimized resource tracking and utilization, reducing lab material waste by 15% and lowering operational costs by $20,000 annually.\n‍\nConsistency\nConsistency is key in the Career Experience section of your CV. Every relevant role should showcase the same type of information:\nCompany name\nJob title\nLocation\nDates of employment\n3-5 achievement-based bullet points\n‍‍\nTeal Note:  If you're applying outside of the US, your career experience section may be more comprehensive and include additional details like job responsibilities. It also might need to cover other non-relevant experiences in a specific order. These details depend on the best practices in the region you're applying and your specific industry.\n‍\nStep 6: Add your educational background\nNext up is your CV's Education section. This section is pretty straightforward and highlights your academic background and the foundational knowledge or specialized training needed for a specific position.\nStart your list with your highest level of education first (this usually flows in a reverse-chronological format), then move backward, listing each subsequent degree or educational qualification. \nHere's what you should include:\nUniversity\nYear graduated\nDegree\nFor international applicants, spell out the location and institution's name\nRecent grads:\nHonors (outside of the US, these are called qualifications)\nCoursework\nProjects\nYour expected graduation date if you're pursuing a degree\n‍\n‍\nTeal Note: The Education, Certifications, and Skills sections should be displayed in the right column of your CV. A CV builder or template should handle this formatting for you. And the order of the sections will vary based on your preference and the importance of each section in your industry.\nIf you're creating your CV without a streamlined tool, you'll need to ensure the formatting aligns with standard CV practices to maintain a professional and organized appearance.\n‍\nStep 7: Include relevant certifications\nA dedicated CV Certification section highlights your credentials, offering insight into your commitment to professional development.\nTo incorporate certifications into your CV, you need:\nThe name of the certification and any common acronyms or abbreviations (like CRA or TEFL)\nThe certification agency with business, institution, or organization name\nThe date the certification was completed\n‍\nCV Certifications should look something like this:\nCertified Research Administrator (CRA)\nResearch Administrators Certification Council\nJune 2023\n‍\nStep 8: Add your skills\nYour CV Skills section comes after your certifications (or education if you don't have relevant certificates). Think of this as a snapshot of your strengths, allowing hiring managers to assess your fit for the role without reading your entire CV. \nThe best skills for this section are tangible ones (think technical abilities, tools, languages, methodologies, and analytical techniques). To make it even easier to read, consider organizing them even further in categories.\n‍\n‍\nPro Tip: While soft skills are an important part of your skillset, there are better places for them than this dedicated section. Things like communication, collaboration, organization, and time management are hard to measure objectively. The best way to show skills like those is to weave them into your other CV sections to show how you used them for impact.\n‍\nStep 9: Add optional sections\nNow that you have all of the necessary CV sections, you might have additional relevant details you want to include, like publications and presentations or additional teaching experience. Creating dedicated sections for this information is the key to keeping everything clear and readable. \n‍\nResearch\nCVs are often used for research positions like academic research roles, postdoctoral fellowships, or research scientist positions. These positions require more in-depth experience and expertise than listed on a traditional resume—which is why a CV is often preferred.\nIn your Research CV section, highlight the following information:\nProjects completed: Detail the scope and objectives\nYour role(s) in each: Specify your responsibilities (e.g., principal investigator, co-investigator, or research assistant)\nMethodologies and frameworks: Describe the research methods and theoretical frameworks applied\nFindings or outcomes and impact: Summarize the key results, publications, or contributions\nFunding details or sources (if applicable): Include information on grants or funding sources that supported your research\n‍\nTeaching Experience\nIf you're applying for an academic position, like a graduate school instructor or law school lecturer, your teaching background should be the focus of your Career Experience section.\nOn the other hand, an additional Teaching Experience section might be worthwhile if you have positions that complement your background or if you're applying for roles where instruction is not the direct focus but still plays a relevant role.\n‍\nHere's an example of a situation where this optional CV section makes sense:\nImagine you're an attorney applying for a graduate program in legal education, and you've also led workshops in your field. Including a Teaching Experience section allows you to highlight this instructional role, demonstrating your ability to lead and communicate complex ideas—skills crucial to success in a graduate program focused on legal education.\nIn this section, include the following:\nCourses, workshops, or seminars\nInstitutions or organizations\nDates\nSpecific accomplishments and results\n‍\nPublications and Presentations\nPublications and presentations provide tangible evidence of your expertise, especially in fields like healthcare and medicine, research, law, and education. More than just accomplishments, they prove your abilities through the recognition and validation of your work by others.\nHere are some ideas to help you get started:\nPeer-reviewed journal articles showcase your ability to conduct high-quality, rigorous work that experts have validated.\nBook chapters demonstrate your capacity to synthesize complex information, provide new insights, and contribute to broader academic or professional conversations.\nConference presentations indicate you aren't just absorbing information but actively participating in and contributing.\nTechnical reports highlight your ability to document and communicate specific research projects' methodologies, findings, and implications.\n‍\nAwards\nAdding awards to a CV offers additional concrete evidence of your skills, dedication, and exceptional performance. And whether the award is a scholarship for academic excellence or recognition for professional accomplishments, if it's relevant to the role or opportunity you're applying for, consider adding it.\n‍\nIn your CV Awards section, add:\nAcademic awards like making the Dean's List or earning honors\nResearch grants speak to the value of your research and your ability to write persuasive proposals\nFellowships are competitive and often prestigious\nScholarships underscore your dedication and achievements, reinforcing your qualifications\nProfessional honors like industry recognition or awards from peers highlight your impact and reputation\n‍\nA CV awards section could look something like this:\nYoung Researcher Award (2023)\n\nInternational Synthetic Biology Symposium\n‍\nProfessional Associations and Volunteer Work\nProfessional associations and volunteering are an important part of your career profile.\nBeing part of professional associations shows you stay up-to-date on industry trends and best practices, which is crucial in any industry experiencing rapid change. Meanwhile, relevant volunteer work highlights your commitment to giving back to your field and developing leadership or team-oriented skills.\nBy including these on your CV, you not only show that you are equipped with up-to-date skills and knowledge but also that you are proactive in contributing to your industry or community.\n‍\nWhen listing your professional associations, they should look something like:\nOrganization names\nMembership status\nTitles or leadership roles held\nContributions to the organization and impact, if applicable\n‍\nTailoring your CV for different applications\nIn the US, your CV should be comprehensive, but that doesn't mean including everything you've ever done. It's important to keep your content relevant to the opportunity.\nWhether you're targeting a job in a specific industry or applying for a graduate program, a well-tailored CV shows you understand what's required and have the right skills and experience. \nCustomizing your CV makes it easier for the person reading it to see why you're a strong fit and increases your chances of standing out in a competitive pool of applicants.\n‍\nHow to tailor your CV\nIf you’re starting from scratch, don’t worry. The process is similar to the one below, but you’ll need to spend a bit more time building out each section following the steps above while keeping the information below in mind for each specific opportunity.\n‍\nIf you started with a base CV, then half of the work is already done. Here’s how to tailor it for a specific job or program:\nRead the JD or application overview: Carefully review the job or program description to understand what the employer or committee is looking for. Identify the top skills, experiences, and qualifications.\nChoose your most relevant details: Go through your base CV and pull the skills and experiences that directly align with the job or program requirements. These are the aspects of your background you want to emphasize.\nTweak the language to match: Adjust the wording in your CV to mirror the language used in the job description or overview. This doesn’t mean copying it word for word but reflecting the important terms and phrases the reader is likely looking for.\nPro Tip: If you tailor your CV with clarity instead of murky guesswork, the Teal CV Builder has a Match Scoring tool that compares the language and skills in your CV to any unique JD—giving you a breakdown score of how well they align. It also offers suggestions for improvement and customizable keyword options to help improve your original score—and your alignment with the position.\n‍\n‍\nCV ATS compatibility\nWhen applying for jobs through online portals in the US, it's important to understand how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) work.\nAn ATS is a digital filing system recruiters use to streamline hiring. These systems scan and organize applications. But, if your CV isn't formatted correctly and can't be parsed or doesn't contain the right keywords a recruiter is searching for once it's scanned into the system, it'll be hard to get in front of a human.\n‍\nHow to make your CV ATS-friendly\nKeep the design simple: Use a straightforward CV layout that's easy for the ATS to scan. Avoid complex formatting that might confuse the system.\nAvoid pictures or graphics: In the US, including images or graphics can cause issues with ATS software, which might not be able to parse them correctly.\nOpt for consistent, clean formatting: Use a consistent font and style throughout your CV, with clear headings and bullet points. Plenty of white space makes your CV easier to scan for both the ATS and recruiters.\nSave as a PDF: Some ATS systems have trouble with different file formats. A PDF is usually the safest bet.\nInclude relevant keywords: Review the job description and include keywords matching the required skills and experience. This increases your chances of being found by a human hiring professional searching the ATS.\n‍\nWrite your CV with Teal\nA well-crafted CV communicates your professional value and increases your chances of landing more interviews and opportunities. By following the guidelines above, you'll present your achievements and expertise in a clear and organized manner relevant to the person reading it.\nIf you need help getting started, Teal's CV builder offers customizable sections, keyword optimization, and version control.

Use Teal's free AI Resume Builder to craft one using the powerful SAR method today.\n‍\nUnderstanding the SAR method\nTo effectively showcase your professional accomplishments, understanding the SAR method is crucial. Here's what the SAR method stands for and why it's beneficial for resume writing:\n‍\nWhat is the SAR method?\nThe SAR method is a structured approach to showcasing your professional accomplishments on your resume. SAR stands for Situation, Action, and Result, and is now widely adopted in resume writing.\nThis resume method helps you, the candidate, create an impressive resume and answer the interviewers' questions using specific and concrete examples from your past experiences and skills.\n‍\n‍\nThe SAR method is nearly identical to the STAR method but excludes \"Task,\" relying solely on \"Action\" to address how the project was completed. This approach shifts the focus from job responsibilities to concrete contributions and their impact, giving the hiring manager a better understanding of how you moved the needle.\n‍\nWhy use the SAR method in your resume?\nImplementing the SAR method in your resume offers several advantages:\nDemonstrates problem-solving skills: By detailing situations and actions, you showcase your ability to overcome challenges.\nProvides concrete evidence of your capabilities: SAR statements offer specific examples that substantiate your skills and experiences.\nMakes your resume more engaging and memorable: Storytelling through SAR captures attention, making your resume more memorable.\nAligns with what recruiters and hiring managers look for: Employers seek what SAR statements highlight: measurable impact.\n‍\nElements of the SAR method\nBefore you can master SAR statements, you need to understand each component (Situation, Action, and Result) to create compelling narratives that resonate with employers. Here's how to implement each step:\n‍\nSituation\nThe \"Situation\" component sets the stage for your achievement. It describes the context or challenge you faced in your professional experience. When framing this part of an achievement:\nChoose relevant situations that align with the job.\nKeep your description concise, focusing on key details that clarify the context.\nAvoid industry jargon, unless you're sure the reader will understand it.\n‍\nAction\nThe \"Action\" component details the steps you took to address the specific situation. This is where you showcase your skills and initiative. To make this section impactful:\nFocus on your specific contributions, especially if it was a team effort.\nUse strong action verbs to enhance the impact of your statements.\nBe clear and concise about what you did, avoiding unnecessary details.\n‍\nResult\nThe \"Result\" component is crucial as it demonstrates the outcome of your actions. This is where you show the value you brought to your previous employer. To make your results compelling:\nQuantify your achievements wherever possible (e.g., percentages, dollar amounts, time saved).\nExplain the positive outcomes of your actions, even if they can't be quantified.\nLink your results to broader business goals to show your understanding of the bigger picture.\nUse AI to Write Resume Achievements\n‍\nHow to use SAR statements for your resume\nImplementing SAR can transform your resume and boost your application-to-interview rate. Here's where and how to use SAR in your resume:\nStep-by-step guide to writing SAR statements\nIdentify key achievements: Review your work history for significant accomplishments.\nBreak down achievements: For each, identify the Situation, Action, and Result.\nDraft SAR statements: Craft concise statements that flow logically and highlight your contributions.\nRefine statements: Edit for clarity, impact, and relevance to the job.\n‍\nHow to use the SAR method in your work experience\nWhen you’re ready to write your work history bullets and resume accomplishments, here are the steps to take to craft your own SAR interview method bullet points:\nList your previous responsibilities: Choose one of your past jobs to focus on and write a list of all the things—tasks, responsibilities, solutions, recognition, achievements, and more—you did while you were in that role. This doesn’t need to be a polished list. Your goal is to get everything down on paper.\nIf you're struggling to remember what you did in a past role, look back at resources like:\nYour LinkedIn profile\nLinkedIn recommendations\nPerformance reviews\nMeeting notes and summaries\nEmails\nCompare your list to the job profile: You’ve likely heard this career advice before—the best way to make sure your resume stands out to recruiters and hiring managers is to confirm it’s a solid match with the position summary.\nThe point of your resume isn’t to present you as qualified—it’s to present you as qualified for that specific role. It’s your resume’s job to draw parallels between the position’s requirements and your capabilities, rather than leaving the potential employer to connect the dots.\nReview the job posting for key skills, qualifications, and emphasized traits. Compare these with your list from step one, identify overlaps, and prioritize including matching responsibilities in your document.\nMatching Mode in Teal’s Resume Builder can help. Attach a job posting to your resume and Teal will suggest top keywords and skills that should appear on your resume.\nAdd JD Keywords to Your Resume\n‍\n‍\nDescribe the situation: Apply the SAR method to craft your first impactful bullet point. Focus on a specific achievement or responsibility to avoid overwhelming details.\nAsk yourself: What was happening in my organization or on my team when I did this? Was it during a rebrand, acquisition, product launch, event planning, or a strategic shift?\nYou don’t need to get into the nitty-gritty details. Rather, you just need to give a bit of background so the interviewer or hiring manager can get a sense of the bigger picture.\nSituation example: Our organization faced declining sales in a key market.\nDetermine your action:  Move beyond general descriptions to outline the specific actions you took to fulfill your role.\nAsk yourself: What specific steps did I take to fulfill my responsibility to my company? The more specific you can get here, the better. Recruiters don’t just want to see buzzwords—they want to understand the actions you took with tangible examples.\nAction example: Developed a targeted sales strategy, revamped sales pitches, used data and conducted personalized outreach to high-potential clients.\nQuantify your results: Highlight the most crucial aspect of the SAR format: results. Provide evidence that your actions made a meaningful impact and added tangible value.\nLook at your action and ask: What happened? What results did I achieve?\nWherever you can, quantify your results with real numbers for extra impact. That doesn’t always mean every SAR bullet point must include data with a hard number. From forging strong relationships to streamlining processes, there are plenty of results you can include that aren’t strictly metric-driven.\nResults example: Achieved a 40% increase in regional sales and exceeded quarterly targets by 15%.\nPull it all together: You've laid the groundwork; now it's time to craft an impressive SAR bullet point. Incorporate all three elements—Situation, Action, Result—without adhering strictly to that order.\nUse action verbs to demonstrate ownership and stand out to recruiters. Here’s how to structure your SAR bullet points:\nSituation-Action-Result: Overhauled declining sales in a key market region by developing a targeted sales strategy, revamping the sales pitch, and conducting personalized outreach to high-potential clients, resulting in a 40% increase in regional sales and exceeding quarterly targets by 15%.\nAction-Situation-Result: Developed a targeted sales strategy, revamped the sales pitch, and conducted personalized outreach to high-potential clients to revitalize sales in a declining market region, resulting in a 40% increase in regional sales and exceeding quarterly targets by 15%.\nResult-Situation-Action: Achieved a 40% increase in regional sales and exceeded quarterly targets by 15% by developing a targeted sales strategy, revamping the sales pitch, and conducting personalized outreach to high-potential clients, revitalizing sales in a previously declining market region.\nYou can make this process a little easier on yourself with the AI resume achievements in Teal’s AI Resume Builder. Click “add an achievement” and then “write with AI” and Teal will automatically write three bullet point options for you to tweak and include on your resume.\nWrite a Resume with AI\n‍\n‍\nHow to write SAR method bullet points with ChatGPT\nWriting effective resume bullets can be draining, but AI can help automate it. Here’s how to use ChatGPT to craft SAR bullet points:\nSave job description: Use Teal’s Chrome extension to save the job post to your Teal Job Tracker. Use Matching Mode in Teal's Resume Builder to identify all hard skills, soft skills, and key emphasis words to use.\nCompare and narrow down: Compare the job outline to your qualifications.

Be precise.\nVague: \"Improved customer service processes.\"\nSpecific: \"Redesigned customer service workflow, reducing average call handling time by three minutes and boosting customer satisfaction by 22%.\"\n‍\nFocus on accomplishments, not duties\nShow achievements, not just responsibilities.\nJob Duty: \"Responsible for managing social media accounts.\"\nAccomplishment: \"Grew social media following by 200% and increased engagement rates by 75% through targeted content strategies and influencer partnerships.\"\n‍\nQuantify results\nNumbers and metrics make your achievements credible and impactful.\nUnquantified: \"Increased sales through new marketing initiatives.\"\nQuantified: \"Launched targeted email marketing campaign, generating $500K in new revenue within the first quarter, a 30% overall sales increase.\"\nFor tricky-to-quantify results, use ranges, percentages, or comparative statements:\n\"Consistently rated in the top 5% of customer satisfaction scores among a team of 50 representatives.\"\n\"Cut project completion time by approximately 20-25% through process improvements.\"\nTailor your PAR statements for each application\nAnalyze the job description: Pinpoint key skills and requirements.\nPrioritize relevant accomplishments: Highlight accomplishments that align with the role.\nAdjust language and focus: Match your statements to the company's culture and values.\nTailor Your Resume With Teal\n‍\nUse advanced PAR techniques\nOnce you’ve nailed the basics, elevate your resume with these advanced strategies:\n‍\nCombine multiple PAR statements\nMerge related resume achievements into comprehensive PAR statements.\nExample: \"Tackled declining market share and customer retention.

Learn how to format your resume like a pro.","Content":"3 key takeaways\nHarvard invented a classic and clean resume framework.\nThis resume format focuses on sections like education, experience, leadership, and skills. Unlike a standard resume, it prioritizes education above experience.\nYou can create a Harvard resume and tailor it to your job application with Teal's AI Resume Builder.\nYou’ve probably heard that the Harvard resume format is one of the best templates for recent graduates. After all, it was created and is continually recommended by Harvard recruiters and counselors.\nThe Harvard resume is clean and professional and highlights education over work experience. Considering the minimal work experience most recent graduates bring, it can be an excellent framework for building your resume. \nBut how do you use it to create your resume? Below, you'll learn how to use the Harvard University resume format, including examples.\nNeed help to landing interviews with your resume? Sign up for Teal to make a free resume in minutes.\n‍\nUnderstanding the Harvard resume format\nThe Harvard Offices of Career Services, in conjunction with the Career and Academic Resource Center, created the Harvard resume format.\nThe aim was to help both Harvard students and graduates of other universities create resumes that highlight their education and land them jobs.\nBecause of its more significant focus on education, leadership, and activities over job experience, this resume format works best for those just entering the job market.\n‍\n‍\n‍\nLet's examine each resume section and how they differ from traditional resumes.\n‍\nEducation\nTypically, the education section of a resume is at the bottom rather than the top. The Harvard-style resume flips this on its head, listing education just after the resume header.\n‍\nIt’s acceptable for job seekers without experience in the job market to put education details at the top of a resume. Education also tends to carry more weight if you apply for internships or master's programs.\nIf you’ve gained experience within your projected career path and it’s been a few years since you graduated, move your education details to the bottom of your resume.\n‍\nExperience\nYour work history and experiences should make up the bulk of your resume. But if you’re a recent graduate, you might not have as much to show, as you can see in the Harvard resume example.\nThis is where you see more similarities with the typical resume format. The Harvard resume template holds a standard of four bullet points for each position held. Each bullet point should only be one sentence long.\n‍‍\nFollow these rules when formatting each bullet point:\nBeginning with your most recent position, describe your experience, skills, and resulting outcomes in bullet or paragraph form. \nBegin each line with an action verb and include details to help the reader understand your accomplishments, skills, knowledge, abilities, or achievements. \nQuantify where possible. \nDo not use personal pronouns; each line should be a phrase rather than a complete sentence.\nThis advice is standard across the recruitment and resume writing industries, but it’s still pertinent. \n‍\n\n‍\nActivities\nThe leadership and activities section on a resume is acceptable to feature if you’re fresh out of college and the activities are relevant to the position. However, on most resumes, there is little room or need to feature this section. \nIt can be a great way to highlight skills, certain responsibilities you’ve held, or outcomes you’ve achieved to supplement a lack of work history. Most potential employers don’t need this information unless those activities can supplement work experience.\n‍\nSkills\nThe Harvard resume template does something unique with the skills section—breaking the skills down into four categories:\nTechnical\nLanguage\nLaboratory\nInterests\nThe technical and laboratory skills bullet points are the most nuanced. Technical skills should list any computer skills or coding languages you’ve learned, while the laboratory line asks you to list any specific tools or techniques you’ve used.\nResist the urge to explain every skill. In some cases, you may need to specify your proficiency. However, if you are fluent in languages, list each language you know. You can write them in one line separated by commas, like this: \n‍\n\n‍\nTeal’s AI-powered Resume Builder allows you to add all of your technical skills in one easy form and then select and de-select the skills you’d like to feature on your resume.‍\nHow you lay out your resume will greatly depend on how much experience you have in your field, your skills, and which university you attended (including your grades and accolades).\nBut the four sections in the Harvard resume format generally benefit any new grad or student resume.\n‍\nHow to create a Harvard resume using a resume template\nWhen you don’t have much experience on your resume, highlighting your education is a safe bet.\nThe Harvard format gives you a good launch pad for emphasizing the benefits of your education. If you understand each section and tailor it to the position, you’re much more likely to stand out in a candidate pool.\n‍\nConsider the position\nYour final resume isn’t going to look like a perfect replica of the template. That’s because the position you’re applying for will call for different highlights on your resume. \nFor instance, you might apply for a competitive internship that values GPA more heavily than other internships.  In some cases, GPA isn’t just a qualification for admittance. An organization might also have a minimum acceptable standard. Still, it might also be a metric for whether or not you maintain your internship. \nIn such a case, you’ll need to feature your GPA on your resume and any other accolades within your education that might give you a competitive advantage.\n‍\nFill in the sections of the template\nIn the previous section, you saw the differences between traditional and Harvard resumes. Here, we’re breaking down how to fill out your resume with those differences in mind. \nEnter your contact information\nFilling out the top of your resume is straightforward. Your resume header should contain contact details such as your name, address, and email. You don’t have to include your entire email. Your city and state are enough.\n‍\n\n‍\nAdd your education\nIf you’re keeping the Harvard format, your education section is at the top, just under your details. Again, this is beneficial if you’re applying to further educational programs, such as a master’s program, an internship, or an entry-level position.\nThe template offers three possible rows of information within the education section—college, study abroad, and your high school.\nUnless the position specifically requests high school information or it's required to enter the program, including it on your resume is unnecessary. This also applies to your study abroad program. While it’s advantageous in an educational program application, it’s not often necessary for employment.\n‍\nAdd your work history\nThe work experience section of the Harvard resume includes slots for just two places of employment. This is because it’s essentially a student resume.\nTo fill out this section, start with the company name, position, and period you worked there. \nAdd three to four bullet points under your organizational header. The typical job seeker might add their responsibilities within those roles, but this won’t help you stand out among other candidates. \nInstead, focus on outcomes you’ve produced, contributions you’ve made, and skills you’ve developed. Here’s what that advice looks like on the resume of an applicant who’s only held a few entry-level roles:\n‍\n\n‍\nYou might not have a lot of experience, and it’s unlikely you were able to have a massive impact on the company in an entry-level or internship position. But you likely gained hard and soft skills by working on something for some time. \nNotice the action verbs in two of the three lines in the above example? Words like increased, improved, and boosted are “active” words to quickly demonstrate that you’ve had impact in your role.\n‍\nLeadership roles and activities\nLeadership and activities are optional on a resume and should only be included if they directly relate to the responsibilities listed in the job description. \nIf you add your leadership projects and activities, be sure to include any outcomes that came from those activities.\nYou don’t need to include all of this detail. One or two lines should be enough to showcase the project unless you’re compensating for lower work experience. \n‍\nRelevant skills and interests\nSkills and interests are another optional section on your resume. While Harvard offers four opportunities to include such information, you could include one or two and eliminate the rest if they’re pertinent or might increase your chances of getting hired. \nFor instance, language skills are in demand across most industries. They may also be a necessary qualification for some roles or may position you in a higher pay grade upon acceptance for a role. In such cases, adding that information to your resume is essential. \nTechnical skills are vital for roles in software, IT, or engineering. Laboratory skills will matter if you’re applying for a role in a STEM profession, such as a geneticist or food scientist. \n‍\nProofread for red flags and typos\nCertain resume red flags automatically take you out of the candidate pool. These red flags include:\nSpelling and grammar errors\nIrrelevant information\nA lack of results-oriented experience\nWhile recruiters and hiring managers aren’t going to examine your resume with a fine-toothed comb, obvious spelling and grammar errors stand out. As does an abundance of those errors. Always check your work before sending it.\n‍\nHarvard resume example\nHere’s an example of the Harvard resume in action.\nYou see education at the top followed by professional experience and technical skills. The example also shows active and powerful language for the bullet points of each position held. It’s a clear and professional demonstration of this resume format. \n‍\n‍\nHarvard resume template\nIf you want to use the Harvard resume template recommended by Harvard recruiters, here’s a template of the sections they use:\nName\n\nLocation\n\nEmail address\n\nPhone number\n\nEducation\n\nStudy abroad\n\nExperience\n\nJob title 1/ Employer 1 (your most recent employer)(month/ year-month/year)\n\n(Action verb) (Accomplishment with quantification)\n(Action verb) (Accomplishment with quantification)\n(Action verb) (Accomplishment with quantification)\n\nExperience\n\nJob title 1/ Employer 1 (month/ year-month/year)\n\n(Action verb) (Accomplishment with quantification)\n(Action verb) (Accomplishment with quantification)\n(Action verb) (Accomplishment with quantification)\n\nLeadership and activities\n\nSkills and interests\n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid when using the Harvard resume\nYour resume should always highlight your most vital assets and qualifications. You'll be in great shape if you focus on outcomes and key skills. \nHowever, you want to avoid a few common mistakes if you hope to get shortlisted for the position. \n‍\nSpelling and grammar errors\nIt’s easy to misspell a word here and there, but on a resume, it can be the difference between getting shortlisted or being cut from the candidate pool. \nThere are a few ways to avoid the latter:\nUse a tool like Grammarly to catch misspellings and grammar mistakes.\nRun your resume through ChatGPT to catch mistakes.\nEmploy an editor to provide more detailed and nuanced feedback.\nUse Teal’s resume builder to catch mistakes and optimize your inputs to highlight your strengths.\n‍\nMissing contact information\nThis isn’t a huge misstep, but if you send in your application without contact information, a hiring manager won’t be able to reach you if they’re interested. \nSimilarly, the position you’re applying for could be dependent on location. You might face instant rejection if you’re missing, or misspelled, your location. \n‍\nUsing passive voice\nMost job seekers make the mistake of using passive voice on their resume. But sentences like \"sales targets were consistently met\" will not grab anyone's attention.\nAlways use active voice on your resume. Active voice requires the use of “I” as a pronoun and the use of power words like “boosted” and “improved”. \nSo instead of saying, \"Sales targets were consistently met,\" you'd say, \"Exceeded annual sales targets by an average of 15%...\". The goal is always to get as specific as possible with your real achievements within a role.\n‍\nLack of personalization\nResume personalization isn’t about including information about the company or the hiring manager. It’s about thoroughly understanding the job description and tailoring your resume to match it within reason. \nTeal’s AI-powered Resume Builder analyzes job descriptions to identify the keywords and most important details to include in your resume. \nFor more tips on creating an effective resume, check out this post on the best resume format.\n‍\nHow to create your Harvard resume with AI\nHarvard has made it easy to follow their resume format by opening their template in Google Docs or Word.

However, they dig even deeper into your skills and experience, qualifications, and work experience. They also include information only applicable for federal jobs.\nThat information carries a lot of weight. For many federal jobs, there are specific legal reasons why an employer can only consider candidates who meet all of the stated requirements. And if that weren’t enough pressure, it can also impact your pay scale. So, needless to say, it’s crucial to present your qualifications effectively. \nThis guide digs into how to use the federal resume format to improve your chances of securing a position with the federal government.\nWant to create a standout federal resume that meets all the requirements? Make a resume that meets federal standards with Teal's Resume Builder.\n‍\nUnderstanding the federal resume format\nBefore you get into the details of your education, skills, and accomplishments, it helps to get a general understanding of what federal resumes are, when you need to use them, and what makes them different from other resume formats.\n‍\nWhat is a federal resume?\nA federal resume is a specific type of resume used to apply for a federal position—whether the role is with the government or another federal agency.\nWhile a typical resume is a marketing tool aimed at helping you impress a recruiter and land an interview, a federal resume is more than a highlight reel or employment summary. It’s a crucial part of the vetting and evaluation process for federal jobs. \nFederal positions often have more strict and rigid requirements than private sector jobs. The hiring manager will use your resume along with the supporting documents submitted to determine whether you have the experience required to fill the open position. This could include transcripts, performance evaluations, self-assessments, military service paperwork, and more.\n‍\nWho needs a federal resume?\nYou need a federal resume when applying for a job with the federal government, whether it’s with an intelligence agency like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or another government department.\nThe easiest way to tell if you need a federal resume is to look where the job announcement is posted. If it’s posted on any of the following sites, you need to apply with a federal resume:\nUSAJOBS.gov\ngovernmentjobs.com\nAny government agency website\n‍\nWhat makes a federal resume different?\nYou’ll recognize a lot of the aspects of a federal resume. What separates it from a more typical resume is the depth. \nA federal resume will provide more context and information about your skills and experience, particularly within each position description. For that reason, it’s often longer than a typical resume that fits on one or two pages.\n‍\nFederal resumes vs private sector resumes\nHere’s a quick look at the key differences between a federal resume and a civilian or private sector resume:\n‍\n‍\nBoth approaches default to the reverse-chronological resume format, where your previous positions are listed with the most recent at the top. However, there’s flexibility to adjust to a functional resume or a combination resume format in terms of ordering sections, if that feels like the better fit.\nNot sure whether to use a functional or chronological format? This post on functional vs. chronological resumes can help you make your decision. To understand when to use which resume format, check out this guide on the best resume format to have.\n‍\nWhat are the key components of a federal resume?\nYour federal resume will have all of the standard resume sections you’re accustomed too, albeit with more information and detail included. If you’re completely new to resume writing, review this beginner’s guide on how to make a resume to get the lay of the land first.\nA federal resume includes the following sections:\nResume header\nProfessional summary\nWork experience\nSkills\nEducation\nYou can also add additional sections for other relevant information, such as military experience, volunteer work, or other qualifications pertinent to the role. Here’s a closer look at each of the above sections and how to make the most of them. \n‍\nHeader\nYour header goes directly at the top of your resume and includes basic information such as your:\nFull name\nContact information (email address and phone number)\nLocation or preferred location (if willing to relocate)\nLinkedIn profile\nYou’ll need all of that on your federal resume. However, depending on the specific federal job, you might also need to include other details such as:\nAvailability: The job type you’re looking for (permanent, temporary, etc.) as well as your desired work schedule (full-time, part-time, shift work, etc.)\nCitizenship: Your country of citizenship (this is especially important if outside the US)\nGeneral Schedule (GS) grade: Level used by the federal government to rank your qualifications and compensation for the position, so always include it if you have one\nJob description: Most federal jobs require you to include the job announcement number, title, series, grade, and any other important information related to the job.\nSecurity clearance: Required for some government jobs that work with sensitive information, so include this information if applicable\nVeteran status: Indicates whether or not you’re a military veteran\n‍\nFederal resume header example\nJane M. Doe\njanedoe@example.com | 123-456-7890 | linkedin.com/in/janedoe/ | Washington, D.C.\nPosition: Cybersecurity Analyst, Department of Homeland Security\nAnnouncement: DHS-CYBER-2024-0017, GS 2210-13\nAvailability: Permanent, full-time work\nCitizenship: United States\nGS Grade: GS-13\nVeteran Status: 5-point preference\n‍\nProfessional summary\nYour professional summary (often called your resume summary) goes directly below your header and is a concise overview of your relevant experience, knowledge, skills, and special accomplishments.\nYour summary should call attention to the qualifications that present you as the best applicant for the job. On a federal resume, that usually takes shape as an introductory paragraph of two to four sentences followed by a bulleted list of your related abilities and achievements. \nRemember that hiring managers use federal resumes as vetting tools, so your summary is less about highlighting what you’re most proud of and more about highlighting what's most relevant. \nStruggling to come up with your own? Teal’s Resume Summary Generator pulls keywords, technical skills, soft skills, and other important language from the job description and combines it with details from your work history and experience to create a tailored resume summary statement.\nCreate a Resume with AI\n‍\n‍\nFederal resume summary example\nHighly skilled and results-driven Cybersecurity Analyst with over 10 years of experience in the field of information security. Adept at protecting sensitive data and systems by identifying and mitigating cyber threats through advanced security measures. Proven track record of enhancing cybersecurity posture and effectively managing incident response efforts. Strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams.\nIncident Response Lead: Spearheaded the incident response team that successfully mitigated a major cyber attack on a federal agency, resulting in zero data loss and saving the agency an estimated $2 million in potential damages.\nSecurity Assessment Expertise: Conducted over 50 comprehensive security assessments for various government agencies, identifying critical vulnerabilities and providing actionable recommendations that led to a 40% improvement in overall security metrics.\nCybersecurity Training Program: Developed and implemented a cybersecurity awareness training program for over 1,000 employees, which resulted in a 60% reduction in phishing attack success rates and significantly enhanced the organization's security culture.\n‍\nWork experience\nYour work history takes up a large portion of your resume. You’ll list your different positions in reverse-chronological order, with your most recent or current position at the top. You’ll include the basic details that go on any resume, like your job title, employer name, employer location, and the dates you worked in that position.\nHowever, your federal resume will include additional information that’s only relevant to federal positions:\nHours worked per week\nGrade or rank level\nSalary or compensation\nSupervisor name, contact information, and whether they can be contacted\nYou may not need all of that—it depends on the specifics of the job and your experience. Underneath those basics, you’ll go into detail about your job duties. While you need to explain what you did, you also need to highlight why that work mattered by quantifying your bullet points and accomplishments. \nRemember to keep relevance in mind as well. Take another look at the job description to make note of the responsibilities so you can describe your own experiences in a way that connects directly to those duties. \n‍\nFederal resume work experience example\nCybersecurity Analyst | January 2020 - June 2023\nDepartment of Homeland Security | Washington, D.C.\n\nHours/Week: 40 | Grade Level: GS-13 | Salary: $98,000 per year\nSupervisor: John Smith | john.smith@dhs.gov | 555-987-6543 | May contact\nLed the incident response team in handling over 200 cybersecurity incidents annually, reducing average resolution time by 30% through efficient processes and strategic planning.\nImplemented advanced security measures, including multi-factor authentication and encryption protocols, resulting in a 50% decrease in unauthorized access incidents.\nConducted vulnerability assessments and penetration tests on critical systems, identifying and remediating over 300 high-risk vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing system security by 45%.\nCollaborated with other federal agencies and private sector partners to share intelligence and best practices, improving threat detection and response capabilities across the board by 25%.\nDeveloped and delivered cybersecurity training programs for 1,500+ employees, leading to a 60% reduction in phishing attack success rates and improved overall cybersecurity awareness.\nEnsured compliance with federal cybersecurity regulations and standards, including Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines, achieving a 100% compliance rate during annual audits.\nLed a team in the successful migration of sensitive data to a secure cloud environment, enhancing data protection and reducing the risk of data breaches by 35%.\nWriting your own metric-driven achievements can be tough, but Teal’s AI Resume Builder can help. Click to add an achievement to your resume and then select the “Write with AI” button. Teal will automatically generate three bullet point options for you to edit and add to your own resume.\n‍\n‍\nYour skills section is where you’ll provide a list of your most relevant and impressive skills to your federal resume. While your abilities should shine through in your summary and work history, this section is an easy spot to tailor to the job description and swap in skills that show you have the knowledge and experience required for that position. \nAim to include a mix of technical skills (like expertise with specific programs) as well as soft skills (like teamwork and leadership activities) to give the hiring manager a well-rounded understanding of what you bring to that position.\n‍\nFederal resume skills example\nCybersecurity Incident Response\nVulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing\nAdvanced Threat Detection & Mitigation\nRisk Management Framework (RMF)\nCompliance with Federal Regulations (FISMA, NIST)\nCybersecurity Training & Awareness Programs\nAnalysis & Problem-Solving \nCommunication & Presentation\nTeam Leadership & Collaboration\nStrategic Planning & Project Management\n‍\nFederal resume education\nYour education section is similar to what you’d include on a traditional, private sector resume. You’ll list your degrees, the school you attended, and the date you obtained them. You should also include relevant certifications, designations, or specialized training in this section, especially if they’re mentioned in the job description.\nIf you want to go beyond the basics, you can add your GPA, relevant coursework, special honors, or important presentations, projects, and papers to this section. However, those aren’t required.\n‍\nFederal resume education example\nMaster of Science in Cybersecurity\nGeorge Mason University, Fairfax, VA\nGraduated: May 2012\nBachelor of Science in Computer Science\nVirginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA\nGraduated: May 2010\nCertifications\nCertified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)\nCertified Ethical Hacker (CEH)\nCertified Information Security Manager (CISM)\nCompTIA Security+\nCertified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP)\nThe above are the must-have sections to include on your federal resume. However, it’s not a rigid mold. You can add sections and information for your professional organizations, volunteer experiences, special projects, relevant awards and achievements, and any other qualifications that relate to the position.\n‍\nFederal resume format template\n[Name]\nname@example.com | 123-456-7890 | linkedin.com/in/firstnamelastname/ | [City, State]\nPosition: [Current title]\nAnnouncement: [job announcement number]\nAvailability: [Full-time, part-time, etc)\nCitizenship: [Country]\nGS Grade: [General schedule grade]\nVeteran Status: [If a veteran, give your status]\nProfessional Summary\n[Summary paragraph]\n[Bullet point achievement 1]\n[Bullet point achievement 2]\n[Bullet point achievement 3]\nWork experience\n[Past role 1]\n[Past role 2]\n[Past role 3]\nSkills\nSkill 1\nSkill 2\nSkill 3\nEducation\n[University]\n[City, State]\n[Graduation date]\nCertifications\nCertification 1\nCertification 2\nCertification 3\n‍\n5 must-know tips for writing a federal resume\nLike any other resume, crafting a resume that’s suitable for federal job openings takes some time and finesse. Here are a few federal resume tips to keep in mind when you’re writing and reviewing your document.\n‍\n1. Read the directions carefully\nFederal job openings often include a lot of information about both the job and the application process. Review those closely so your resume and application materials check every box.\n‍\n2. Lean on existing resources\nFederal resumes can seem intimidating, but the government and other organizations offer plenty of resources to guide you. For example, check out:\nFederal resume templates from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\nFederal resume tips from the U.S. Department of the Interior\nFederal resume template from the FBI\nWhen you’re ready to pull all of your information together, Teal’s AI Resume Builder can help you craft a polished and impressive document without the stress and formatting headaches.\nChoose a Free Resume Template\n‍\n‍\n3. Spell out acronyms\nGovernment employment comes with plenty of acronyms and jargon. Spell them out so the recruiter doesn’t have to guess.\n‍\n4. Remember relevance\nEmployers don’t just want to know your previous responsibilities and accomplishments—they want to know how they’ve made you uniquely prepared to address the duties of that specific job.\nSo, don’t get so wrapped up in the logistics of writing a federal resume that you forget the importance of relevance. Use the job description as your guide as you look back at your career and decide what information to include.\n‍\n5. Use a federal format\nConsider this your golden rule: If you’re applying for a federal job, you need to use a federal resume format. Don’t create a traditional resume and expect the hiring manager to process and translate that information into the format they need. They won’t take the time to do so.\n‍\nHow to write your best federal resume with Teal\nReady to prepare your resume? Here’s how to make it easy with Teal’s AI Resume Builder: \n1. Import your LinkedIn profile or an existing resume, or start from scratch.\n2. Attach a job description to your resume so Teal’s Matching Mode can identify keywords and skills to include.\n‍\n‍\n3. Use the checkboxes in each resume section to decide which information to include and which to remove.\n\n‍\n4. Use AI to add metric-driven achievements to your roles.\n\n‍\n5. Review Teal’s Analysis to see your resume score and expert suggestions to make your resume even stronger.\n‍\n‍\n6. Visit the Design tab to easily reorder or rename your sections to fit the typical federal resume format\n‍\n7. On the Design tab, you can also customize your resume format, alignment, font, layout, styling, and more\n‍\n‍\nWhen you’re completely satisfied with your document, export it as a PDF and submit it with your cover letter (Teal’s Cover Letter Generator can help with that part too) and other supporting documents.\nApplying for a federal job can feel nerve-racking, but Teal’s AI Resume Builder can help you nail the right level of detail—without all of the nail biting.\nReady to write your best federal resume?

By using AI, the process becomes simpler, faster, and more customized to your needs. AI also makes it easier to tailor your content for each unique position—showcasing your skills and experiences in the most relevant way.\n\n\n‍\nWant to skip the steps and write your resume with AI without having to toggle between platforms or programs? Sign up for Teal for free!\n\nWhat is Google Bard? \nBard is a conversational AI chatbot developed by Google. It uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to queries. As a chatbot, it mimics human writing, engages in dialogue, answers questions, and provides information. It does this by generating responses to various prompts.\n\nA screenshot of Google's Gemini logo\nGoogle rebranded Bard as Gemini in 2023.\nIn December 2023, Google rebranded Bard \"Google Gemini.\"\n\nCan Google AI make a resume? \nYes, you can write Google Gemini resume. Using natural language processing, AI can generate text for your professional summary, work experience, skills, and more. \n\nBut it’s important to note that your resume is more than just a collection of text. \n\nThe formatting and structure of a resume are also crucial in making it effective in landing your next interview. \n\nIn that regard, while Gemini (formerly Google Bard) can help with text generation for your resume, it won’t take job seekers as far as a resume builder or the assistance of a professional resume writer.\n\nWrite Your Resume With AI\n‍\n\nHow to use Gemini to write your resume\nGemini AI for a professional summary \nA professional summary, or short professional bio, is important because it can be the make-or-break factor that captures a hiring manager's attention. Ultimately, an effective professional summary helps you stand out and increases your chances of landing an interview.\n\nSince Gemini doesn’t format your resume, Teal’s AI Resume Builder is used to supplement certain parts of this tutorial.\n\nBefore diving into the next steps, now is a good time to create your free Teal account if you haven't already.\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Take your current resume (you’ll need to copy and paste this into Gemini manually or upload a PDF). \n\n2. Use the following prompt: \"Create a professional summary based on my resume.\"\n\n3. Paste your resume into Gemini after the prompt.\n\n4. If you're unhappy with the initial output, it's perfectly acceptable if you ask Gemini to \"try again.\"\n\n5. Choose your favorite phrases from each option and assemble a cohesive, insightful, personalized, and attention-grabbing professional summary.\n\nFor a deeper dive into summary samples, check out this in-depth guide on the best resume summary examples.\n\nGemini for your work experience\nYour resume work experience is arguably the most important part. It showcases your proven success and unique value to potential employers. This section helps a hiring manager see the tangible benefits you’ll bring to their organization.\n\nNote: The directions below assume you’ve entered your resume into Gemini from the last step. If you haven‘t done so, to avoid incorrect information, you’ll need to input your resume to generate an accurate description of your bullet points.\n\nAnd as mentioned before, Gemini doesn’t format your resume for you, so the steps below show how to use Teal's AI Resume Builder to customize and format your resume. \n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Launch \"Matching Mode\" in your Teal AI Resume Builder and choose a job from your Job Application Tracker to concentrate on.\n\nA screenshot of Teal's Matching Mode\nChoose the job you'll be focusing on in Matching Mode.\n2. Head over to the \"Job Description\" tab and navigate to the \"Job Description\" section.\n\nA screenshot of a job description in Teal\nClick on \"Job Description\" to get the right details.\n3. Copy the job description and paste it into Gemini. Enter this prompt: \"Craft resume accomplishments with metrics based on this job description and my resume\"\n\n4. Copy the output from Gemini and, one by one, paste them as accomplishment examples into your Teal AI Resume Builder.\n\n5. Thoroughly proofread and edit the accomplishments, fine-tuning them as necessary. You want to confirm that you genuinely have the experience Gemini claims you do, and you need to double-check for spelling, grammar, punctuation, and clarity.\n\n6. Enable or disable the accomplishments that align with the job you're applying for.\n\nSimplify with Teal's AI\nThe approach above is okay, but also a bit clunky. \n\nAn easier way would be using the generative AI in Teal’s AI Resume Builder. With Teal, you don’t have to copy and paste and jump around between tabs. Instead, with just a click, you can have personalized bullet points that are customized based on your experience, the role you’re applying for—in the same platform you write your resume.\n\nGenerate Your Achievements with AI\n‍\n\nGemini for resume skills \nResume skills are important because they give employers a clear idea of your abilities and strengths. It's a great way to showcase your unique talents, making you a more memorable candidate in a sea of applicants. \n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Launch “Matching Mode” in your Teal AI Resume Builder and choose a job from your Job Application Tracker. \n\n2. Find the job posting and copy the original description. \n\n3.  Paste the job description and the following prompt into Gemini AI: \"What relevant skills should I include in my resume for the position of [job title]? Here is a description of the role: [paste the original job posting here].\"\n\n4. Polish the results and select which skills you want to include on your resume. Open Teal’s AI Resume Builder and add them to the skills section of your resume one at a time. \n\nThe key here is to personalize the skills you include in your resume to the job you’re applying to. While Gemini can help, you get even more insightful tips from Teal’s Job Description Keyword tool. \n\nThe tool will highlight the skills you need for each application, including hard skills, soft skills, and emphasis words: \n\nA graphic of Teal's Keyword Tool\nYou can then use these keywords and phrases as relevant skills for your resume. \n\nHow to create your cover letter with Google AI\nMuch like creating customized resumes, writing Google Gemini cover letters should emphasize your relevant accomplishments for the role you want. When done well, a strong cover letter will go a long way in convincing hiring managers that you have what it takes for the role in question. \n\nCreating great cover letters may seem complex, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. After using \"Matching Mode\" to develop a resume tailored to a specific role, copy the text from that resume and paste it into Google Gemini.\n\n2. Then, copy and paste the requirements and responsibilities into Google Gemini alongside your resume.\n\n3. For the prompt, write, \"Compose a cover letter using my resume and a job description.\"\n\n4. Don't forget to refine your new cover letter in Google Docs or another program before submitting it.\n\nDid you know? Teal can help you create personalized cover letters directly from your dashboard. \n\nGenerate Your Cover Letter With AI\n‍\n\n3 best practices for using Gemini AI for your resume\n1. Give Gemini (Bard) context\nFeeding your current resume into Gemini will help it understand your specific skills and qualifications to generate a more accurate result. (But remember, once it generates output, you'll have to toggle back to the program where you store your resume to add it.)\n\nIf this sounds like an annoying process, that’s because it kind of is. If you want to write with AI without the hassle of going back and forth between multiple programs, consider trying Teal's free AI Resume Builder. \n\nWith Teal, you can quickly change the content and structure of your resume to personalize it for specific roles. Plus, you can use built-in AI to get the same type of output as you would from Gemini. \n\nBuild Your Resume For Free\n‍\n\n2. Make your AI prompts clear\nWhen you ask Gemini to generate a resume, be specific about what you want. For example, you can tell Gemini the type of job you are applying for, the skills you want to highlight, and the resume format you want your resume to be in.\n\nTry the following prompt: \n\n\"I am applying for the position of [job title]. Analyze my current resume and tell me which resume format I should use for that role and what skills I should highlight to stand out from other applicants.\"\n\nThere are two downsides to this approach that you should be aware of, both come back to Gemini's limitations. \n\nFirst, you’ll have to copy and paste your existing resume into Gemini.\n\nSecond, you’ll still need to format the output manually, but Teal can take care of this for you.\n\nTo help you get the most out of these AI tools, try these ChatGPT resume prompts.\n\n3.

It can also be used to write a ChatGPT resume and works with different plugins and tools to extend its capabilities.\n‍\nClaude AI vs. Google Gemini\nGoogle Gemini is another advanced language model focused on understanding multiple languages, processing real-time data, and integrating with Google's services.\nGemini works well with Google Cloud and other enterprise applications, making it a strong choice for business environments. You can also use Google Gemini to write a resume and assist with other job search tasks like cover letter creation. While both are capable, Claude's Sonnet is reviewed as having better collaborative features and coding abilities than Gemini's.\n‍\nClaude AI vs. Teal AI Resume Builder\nWhile Claude is designed to help with various tasks, the Teal AI Resume Builder is specifically designed to craft resumes efficiently and effectively, tailored to highlight your unique skills and experiences.\nWhile Claude offers robust AI capabilities, the Teal AI Resume Builder focuses exclusively on resume writing and cover letter creation, providing targeted features and tools to ensure your resume stands out.\n‍\nLeverage AI to write your resume\nUsing a tool like Claude can speed up your resume writing and potentially improve your job search outcomes. AI offers an efficient way to create tailored resumes that align with job requirements, highlight key achievements, and streamline the resume-writing process.\nBut rather than toggling between platforms or mistake-prone manual edits, try a resume creator like Teal that offers the benefits and speed of generative AI in the same place where you build your resume.

And how often?\"\nWith a proactive approach, your resume will always contain your recent skills and results so you can take advantage of new opportunities, be prepared for any career shift, and confidentially make any transition—without scrambling.\n‍\nWant minimize resume updates? Store your entire career history in one place with Teal's AI Resume Builder.\n‍\nHow often should you update your resume?\nThere's no right or wrong answer for how often you should update your resume. But regularly refreshing it when you learn new skills, earn certifications, apply for jobs, or for networking can be incredibly valuable and a great way to stay prepared for any situation or opportunity.\nA recent LinkedIn survey by Teal highlights that 50% of people only update their resumes when they see jobs they want to apply for. But there are several instances when you should update your resume outside of wanting a new job.\n\n‍\nWhy you need an updated resume\nKeeping your resume current isn't just about ticking a box—it's about staying up to date with your industry and resume trends while strategically positioning yourself at every stage of your professional journey. An updated resume will help you:\nShowcase new skills and experience: Your relevant skills and work experience are constantly growing and evolving. Rather than digging for metrics and tools three months after you've completed a project, accomplished something, or had a big win, update your skills and experience while they're fresh. Updating details while they're top of mind ensures you accurately capture all relevant achievements and newly acquired skills without missing or forgetting any important information.\n‍\nIdentify areas of career development: Resumes aren't just a reflection of past accomplishments thrown together for a job search. They're also a roadmap for future career development.\n\nAs you gain new skills, complete training, or take on additional responsibilities, adding them to your resume will help you track your professional growth and identify gap areas where you might need further development.\nTake advantage of job opportunities: You never know when the next opportunity or challenge is going to come your way.\n\nFind a job you love? An up-to-date, relevant resume will generate a lot more positive results than one with outdated information. It also means you're always ready to jump at exciting new roles without the time-consuming rush of revising your details at the last minute\nImprove your professional brand: Your resume is one way to market your professional identity. It maps out your career and emphasizes your biggest strengths and achievements. By keeping it fresh and updated, you make sure it reflects the very best of who you are now—not just who you were several years ago.\n\nUpdate your resume with Teal\nHave a resume you want to update? Upload it into Teal with one click. Then, update your content as often as you need to for free.\nUpdate Any Resume\n‍\n           \n    \n‍\n‍\nWhen to prioritize a resume update\nTiming your resume updates strategically is important. Whether it's after a big project, a promotion, or even a new certification, regularly refreshing your resume ensures you're always prepared with your latest skills and accomplishments. Here’s when to make those updates.\n‍\nAfter gaining new skills or certifications\nAnytime you develop new skills or acquire certifications, add these to your base resume.\nAlong with keeping your resume up to date, this will help you keep track of your professional development. (And ensures you don't forget anything you've learned along the way!)\n‍\nPro Tip: The free Teal Resume Builder has a dedicated Skills section where you can store all of your skills for free. Then, select the ones most relevant to any job you apply for.\n‍\n‍\nWhen tailoring for each job application\nUsing the same resume for every job application can reduce your chances of getting called for an interview.\nIt’s best practice to update your resume for every job application to align your experience with the job posting. In fact, recruiters and hiring managers identify keywords and the skills and experience they need to see in the details of job descriptions.\nRead the job description carefully, then tailor your resume—highlighting skills, experience, and values that a prospective employer prioritizes.\nFor networking opportunities\nAn up-to-date resume is invaluable for networking events.\nWhether planned or spontaneous, having a current resume allows you to take advantage of any opportunity to connect with industry peers, mentors, or potential employers, making a professional impression right away.\nAt least annually\nAt a bare minimum, you should update your resume at least once a year. \nEven if you don't have any new skills, certifications, or resume bullet points to add (which you most likely will!), you can still polish your resume yearly and ensure that it aligns with current resume writing best practices.\n‍\nPro-tip: Keep a running list of accomplishments and milestones in your current role. Whenever you achieve something noteworthy, jot it down. Then, when it's time to update your resume, you'll have a detailed record of your wins, ensuring you can update your resume quickly.\n‍\n\n‍\n11 tips for updating your resume\nUpdating your resume regularly and tailoring it to the specific job you're applying for will increase your chances of landing an interview.\nAdhering to best practices can help you create a quality resume while also preventing common errors that could discourage hiring managers, (like listing everything you've ever done or forgetting recent wins). Below are some resume tips for updating your content.\n‍\n1. Include the right resume sections\nYour resume sections are key to showcasing your relevant experience.\nOrganizing your personal information, work history, and skills into different, easy-to-navigate sections is a great way to prioritize the most important details.\nInclude the following sections as long as the information in each is relevant and accurate:\nContact Information\nTarget Title\nProfessional Summary \nWork Experience\nEducation\nCertifications\nSkills\nOptional\n– Projects\n– Awards and Scholarships\n– Volunteering and Leadership\n– Publications\n– Interests\nYou don't need to be a certified professional resume writer to do this. Tools like Teal include each of the sections above you can organize, rename, and fill in as you create or update your resume.\n‍\n           \n    \n‍\n2. Update your resume contact information\nTo make sure that potential employers can reach you when you're ready to hit apply, it is crucial to keep your resume header up to date with accurate contact information.\nWhen refreshing your contact details, keep the following in mind:\nUse your first and last name\nInclude a professional email and phone number\nList your location (a physical address isn't necessary)\nInclude your full LinkedIn URL if it's up-to-date\n‍\n3. Update your professional summary\nYour resume's professional summary shows a hiring manager your career in aggregate.\nRather than an outdated resume objective, a short professional bio should be no frills and straight to the point. To update your resume summary, include any new high-level achievements with impact and results.\nDon't want to rework your summary? Create and store unlimited versions in your Teal base resume.\n‍\n4. Remove outdated or irrelevant information\nNot everything in your resume will stay relevant the further you get into your career. After updating your resume summary, review your resume to remove roles, skills, or technologies that no longer represent your current expertise or career direction. Streamlining this content will make it easier for hiring managers to focus on your most impactful and up-to-date accomplishments.\n‍\n5. Add work experience with metrics\nAs your career develops, so do your responsibilities and achievements. Making sure your Work Experience section reflects this is key to showcasing current abilities and expertise (and career progression!). \nAdd any new positions you've held since your last update. Use resume action verbs to describe specific things you've done and the impact and results of those things.\nFor example, don't just say, \"Managed employee training program,\" say something like, \"Implemented targeting training program for new employees that reduced employee turnover by 70% month over month.\"\nAnd remember, while your base resume should store all of the details of your bullet points and their results, when applying for a specific role, you'll tailor this section to match the job description closely. \n‍\n6. Assess skills, certifications, and education\nUpdate your skills section by adding any new capabilities or tools.\nInclude any new certifications, courses, or degrees that improve your qualifications. Remove anything that's expired, and review your Education section to ensure anything you list current and relevant to your career direction.\n‍\nPro Tip: Want to see if your resume has everything you need? The Teal AI Resume Builder has an Analysis Mode that scans your resume and gives you real-time feedback on its effectiveness as it relates to current resume trends.\nAnalyze Your Resume For Free\n‍\n           \n    \n‍\n7. Tailor your resume to a job\nWhen you find a job you want to apply for, update your resume by tailoring it to the job posting. Here's how to do this in 3 steps:\n‍\nStep 1: Updating resume summary and experience\nPrune your professional summary and work experience so the details align with the requirements and responsibilities listed by the potential employer. \nRemember, tailoring your resume isn't just about listing everything you've ever done; it's about framing your relevant experience alongside results and impact to demonstrate how it aligns with the specific role you're applying for.\nTo do this in just seconds with Teal, toggle on the most relevant details by checking the box next to the information you want to show on your resume.\n‍\n\n‍\nStep 2: Adding relevant keywords\nResume keywords are specific words or phrases that relate to the job you're applying for.\nIncorporating relevant resume keywords can increase your chances of being found by recruiters or hiring managers when they search ATS systems for specific skills, experience, or even job titles.\nSo, how do you incorporate them into your resume? \nFor example, if a job description emphasizes \"strong project management skills,\" one of your resume bullets could highlight this by saying, \"Led a team of 10 in a complex project using project management skills and tools like Jira and Asana, increasing efficiency by 15%\n‍\nWant to add keywords quickly? Teal's Resume Job Description Match provides insight into the keywords your resume is missing. Get an overall score and suggested words to improve that score to align your resume with any job.\nCompare Your Resume Keywords To A Job\n‍\n‍\nStep 3: Aligning your skills, educational background, and certifications\nIf you opt to include a Skills section in your resume, make sure everything you list is also found in the job description. You also need to be able to back up this list with tangible proof throughout the other sections of your resume.\nIn addition, everything in your Education and Certification sections (and any other section) should be relevant to the job you're applying for.\n‍\n8. Format your resume\nOnce your resume content is updated and ready, it's time to pick a format.\nThe best resume format helps communicate you have the right skills and experience for a job in a way that's easy for hiring managers to find—quickly.\nThe most common structure is a reverse chronological resume that showcases your work experience in a clear and concise manner starting with your most recent experience. \nOther formats like a functional (skills-based) resume or a hybrid (combination) resume are less familiar, but can be used in situations like when you're just starting out or pivoting careers.\n‍\nHere's a checklist for updating resume formats:\nChoose a reverse-chronological resume template that is clean, simple, and will parse correctly into the ATS.\nOpt for a format that makes sense for your experience and the job you're applying to. (For example, if there's a heavy focus on tools or hard skills, a hybrid format that lists skills beneath your professional summary might be the best option.)\nUse a font and font size that are easy to read.\nKeep margins to one inch.\nCreate sections to highlight your skills, accomplishments, and any previous positions that fit the role's description.\nUse bullet points with action verbs to expand on each job title.\nProofread for misspellings and grammar mistakes.\nUse a free resume tool like Teal to double-check your work.\n‍\n‍\n9. Check consistency in formatting and style\n‍Your resume's appearance matters. Consistent formatting, like uniform fonts, bullet points, and alignment, helps create a polished, professional look. Make sure your headings, dates, and overall structure flow smoothly to improve readability and leave a positive impression.\n‍\n10.

It ensures your experience speaks directly to the job, hits the right keywords for applicant tracking systems (ATS) searches, and shows hiring managers you’ve got what they’re looking for. \nBelow, you'll find a step-by-step guide to help you tailor your resume to job descriptions—quickly. You’ll learn how to match your resume to keywords, optimize it for ATS, and position yourself as a top candidate—without relying on the same generic content for every application.\n‍\n‍\nNeed to tailor your resume to a JD quickly? Use the AI Resume Builder to get the right keywords, optimize for ATS searches, and customize your content.\n‍\nWhat is a tailored resume?\nA tailored resume is a customized resume explicitly designed to match the requirements of a particular job or company you're applying to. A tailored resume aims to demonstrate how the candidate is the best fit for the job and increase their chances of getting hired.\nCustomization in this situation means considering the language used in the specific job description, the responsibilities mentioned, and even researching the employer's expectations before including certain words or facts on your resume. \nTailoring a resume is an excellent way to increase your chances of standing out from other applicants and being noticed by hiring managers.\n‍\nWhy you should tailor your resume to the job description\nCrafting a unique and tailored resume is crucial because:\nIt significantly increases your chances of receiving an interview invite.\nWith so many applicants to compete with during the hiring process, you have to take all the steps you can to get noticed, and tailoring your resume is a great way to do this.\nIt demonstrates how you're the best fit for the job.\nIt draws attention to the fact that you've taken the time to research the company and understand the job requirements.\nCustomizing your resume shows you pay attention to detail and are willing to put in the extra effort to secure a job.\nAnd not only does tailoring your resume help you stand out from the crowd of other job seekers, but it's also an opportunity to showcase your relevant qualifications in a way that matches the job you're applying for. A tailored resume highlights valuable skills, experiences, and accomplishments relevant to the position.\nTL;DR: Whether you're in project management or hold a job title as a sales manager, your general resume should always be tailored to the specific job description of the role you're applying to because it demonstrates how you are the most qualified candidate for the position. \n‍\nWhy tailor your resume for applicant tracking systems\nBehind the scenes, some job search sites and companies use an applicant tracking system or ATS. And while it has somewhat of a negative reputation, the ATS is absolutely nothing to fear.\nAn ATS is simply a software program that helps companies, recruiters, or hiring managers sort applicants into a virtual filing system. Applicant tracking systems allow hiring teams to find candidates through keyword searches like past titles or specific qualifications—quickly.\nIf you're wondering, \"Should I tailor my resume for these tools?\" The answer is: you should tailor your resume for the humans using the tools. By tailoring your resume to the job requirements with your relevant qualifications, you increase the likelihood of hiring managers searching for job-specific keywords to find you, improving your chances of landing an interview.\n‍\nPro Tip: With Teal, you can store all of your primary resume information in one place. Then, when you're ready to apply, use the free AI resume maker to create tailored resumes by adding and removing specific details in minutes with no manual work. \n‍\nCheck your resume score with Teal\nTeal's free resume checker gives you a personalized resume score to quickly see where your resume stands, and where you need to improve.\nYour score is customized based on the specific job you're comparing it to, which can help you better tailor your resume accordingly.\n‍\nThe difference between a comprehensive resume and a tailored resume\nA primary resume is a comprehensive document that includes all of your education, work experience, skills, and achievements. It contains a complete record of your professional history and serves as a reference for creating tailored resumes.\nOn the other hand, a tailored resume is a customized document designed to match a particular job's requirements. And it's created by selecting and highlighting the most relevant information from your primary resume and emphasizing the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the job.\n‍\n5 benefits of tailoring your resume to the job description\nTailoring your resume for each job description might require some effort, but it comes with substantial rewards.\n‍\n1. Increase your chances of landing an interview\nWhen you customize your resume for a specific job description, you're speaking directly to the hiring manager's needs. Your resume becomes the solution to their problem. \nHow so? \nBy showcasing your skills and experiences that directly align with the job requirements. In turn, this significantly ups your chances of landing that all-important interview invitation. \n‍\n2. Demonstrate your understanding of the role\nAdapting your resume to fit a specific job demonstrates your depth of understanding and keenness for the role.\nA tailored resume is a clear sign that you've done your homework and grasp the intricacies of the position and company. It shows you're not just an applicant but a potential asset who's already started thinking about the company's needs.\n‍\n3. Highlight your relevant qualifications\nYour resume should reflect the top 10% of your qualifications that are relevant to the role you're applying to. When you modify your content for each employer's job description, you spotlight your most relevant qualifications for that job. No extraneous details, no fluff—just the essentials they're looking for, served up neatly and compellingly.\n‍\n4. Set yourself apart from other applicants\nIn a pool brimming with talent, you want to be the one who stands out. Tailoring your resume helps you do exactly that. It underscores your genuine interest in the position and sets you apart from those candidates sending the same, unmodified resume to numerous companies.\n‍\n5. Showcase your attention to detail and effort\nFinally, a customized resume is a testament to your attention to detail and willingness to put in the extra effort. It suggests that if you're meticulous with your job application, you're likely to bring the same level of diligence to your role. This can be a powerful selling point to prospective employers.\n‍\nHow to tailor your resume to a job\nThe process of learning how to tailor your resume to a job description involves two high-level steps:\n1. Highlight the hard and soft skills, professional experiences, and key qualifications in the job description of the position you're applying for.\n2. Update your resume to address those specific job requirements and responsibilities directly from step\n‍\nWhether you're a recent graduate, making a career change, or just ready for a new opportunity, creating a resume tailored to a job description is no small feat. But with the right approach, you can tailor your resume to present your relevant experience professionally.\n‍\n‍\nFrom selecting the right keywords to adding a personal touch to using ChatGPT resume prompts, there are numerous tips and tricks to complete the steps above that can help you create a resume that attracts potential employers—so let's get into it! \n‍\n1. Compare your resume and job description\nThe job description will always outline what the company, recruiter, or hiring manager is looking for. Carefully read the JD and take note of the required skills, qualifications, and responsibilities.\nHere's the thing, you have to study and understand job descriptions to see if the role seems like the right fit for you. And you also need to do this to customize your resume to fit its needs. TL;DR? The job posting is the company telling you exactly what they're looking for.\n‍\nHere are some things to look for:\nWhether you need to have a degree\nHow many years of experience are required\nWhat the day-to-day responsibilities are\nWhat previous work experience is most important\nWhat tools you'll need to be familiar with\n‍\nTeal's Job Description Keyword Finder highlights the top keywords from any job description—no copying, pasting, or toggling between screens.\nThen, Job Matching will compare your resume to the job description—giving you a Match Score that you can use to tailor your resume with precision.\nTailor your resume to any job description with Teal's Matching Mode\n‍\nWith Teal, customizing your resume is easy and effective. Match, compare, and optimize it for any job description in one central location.\n\n‍\n2. Research the company\nLooking into the company you're applying to, what they do, and what they stand for is crucial. Knowing these facts during the interview process makes a massive difference. As a bonus, it's not as expected in the application process, so understanding the mission, values, and vision can help you stand out.\n‍\nHere's how you can do this:\nLook at the company website\nCheck out its social channels\nZoom in on their core values if they have them publicly available\nSearch for a video about the company and its product\nThe Teal Resume Builder has a free Company Tracker where you can record specific information beyond the company name or website. Add values, culture, and other details in the customizable \"Notes\" section.\n\nLooking into the company you're applying to, what they do, and what they stand for is crucial. Knowing these facts during the interview process makes a massive difference. As a bonus, it's not as expected in the application process, so understanding the mission, values, and vision can help you stand out.\n‍\nHere's how you can do this:\nLook at the company website\nCheck out its social channels\nZoom in on their core values if they have them publicly available\nSearch for a video about the company and its product\nThe Teal Resume Builder has a free Company Tracker where you can record specific information beyond the company name or website. Add values, culture, and other details in the customizable \"Notes\" section.\nPro Tip:  Search for a podcast that includes the Founder or CEO. Hearing how they describe the company and what they stand for can help you get a feel for their messaging. Document key details in the Teal Company Tracker.\n‍\n3. Focus on the top half of your resume\nThe top half of your resume is the most important because it is the first section that recruiters and hiring managers see. Making a good impression immediately is crucial to entice them to keep reading.\nThis section should be concise, well-organized, and visually appealing, using bullet points, headings, and clear language to highlight your key achievements and qualifications. \nIf you can effectively communicate your value proposition in the top half of your resume, you'll increase the chances of getting an interview and being considered for the job.\n‍\n4. Tailor target job title to the job\n‍When it comes to the target title of your resume, you might think this should reflect the position you currently hold or held in your last role, but not necessarily.\nThe target title of your resume should align as closely as possible with the specific job description of the role you're applying for. So that means each time you fill out an application, you may need to tweak your target to fit the specific role the hiring manager is looking for. (For example, titles like Copywriter, Content Writer, and Content Marketer can have many of the same requirements, but the job titles slightly differ.) \nMaking small changes like this will reflect your thorough understanding of the role. \n‍\n5. Tailor job description and achievements\nNow that you've saved all the important researched information you need and adjusted your target title, you can customize your professional summary. \nThe professional summary section, also known as a short professional bio, is the top section of your resume, giving readers a brief overview of your previous work experience and top skills. In this section, you'll want to highlight the most relevant details and unique aspects of your skills and experiences for the job you're applying for.\n‍\nHere's how to do this:\nCopy and paste some primary key skills and responsibilities into this section\nLay them out in a way that's similar to the job description\nThis personalized approach showcases your ability to meet the job requirements and demonstrates your interest and fit for the position. As a result, it can increase your chances of getting noticed by the hiring manager and ultimately landing the job.\n‍\n6. Customize your resume job description with professional achievements \nYour resume job description, or work experience offers insight into your professional impact and results.\nEspecially when you have several years of job employment history, you should have at least a handful of key accomplishment examples to add. (But of course, these will look different depending on your industry, if you've had multiple positions at the same company, and your seniority.)\n‍\nCustomizing your work experiences on your resume is important because it helps you highlight the achievements and important skills most relevant to the job you are applying for.\nThis process of tailoring your resume for each job application enables you to demonstrate how you can leverage your existing skills, previous experiences, and accomplishments to meet the position's specific requirements.\nBy highlighting your work history, you increase the chances of your resume being noticed by the hiring manager and also show that you're a good fit for the job. Additionally, it helps to make your resume stand out among the many other applicants—giving you a competitive edge.\n‍\nPro Tip: Quantifying your relevant achievements is a way to showcase your dedication and success in past employment or educational endeavors. You can also use ChatGPT to write your resume and help you decide which achievements are more relevant.\nUse the Resume Bullet Point Generator to write more impactful bullets that showcase your results, not just your responsibilities. Or, use the Teal Bullets Assistant shown below.‍\n7. Incorporate relevant keywords\nIt is important to incorporate resume keywords when tailoring your resume to the job description because it helps ensure that it'll be easily discoverable by potential employers and applicant tracking systems. \nBy including applicable keywords and similar language from the specific job description in your resume, you increase the chances that your resume will be picked up by these systems and seen by the hiring manager.\nIncorporating keywords also…\nHighlights your skills and qualifications as they pertain to the role\nHelps your application stand out when hiring mangers search the ATS\nDemonstrates you're a strong fit for the role \nShows your understanding of the job responsibilities and ability to perform required tasks\nThis level of customization also demonstrates that you've taken the time to tailor your entire resume to the specific job, which can impress hiring managers and increase your chances of landing an interview.\nTo find resume keywords easily, use Teal.

(With Teal+, you can see all of the skills and keywords without toggling away from the job ad itself.)\n‍\nTry Teal for free to get personalized keyword recommendations with your resume. Start mirroring the language from the job description.\n‍\n8. Check your Match Score\nOnce you've tailored your resume to the job description, you want to see how closely they align.\n‍\nHow to match your resume to a job description with Teal\nThe Teal Job Matching feature compares the skills and important keywords in your resume to the job description of the role you're applying to with a Match Score.\nThen use the suggestions to bridge any gaps between your resume and the JD—increasing your Match Score and your alignment with the job.\n\n‍\nWant to give it a try? See how closely your current resume aligns with the job description.\n9. Proofread and edit\nEnsure that your updated resume is written in a professional tone and free of errors, typos, and grammatical mistakes. \nProofreading and editing are essential because they help to ensure that the document is free of any errors and inconsistencies, which can negatively impact your chances of being considered for a job.\n‍\nA well-crafted and error-free resume showcases your attention to detail, professionalism, and competence, which can help you stand out among other applicants and make a positive first impression with potential employers.\nAlso, proofreading and editing can help you clearly and effectively communicate your qualifications, skills, and relevant experiences, making it easier for hiring managers to understand why you are the right candidate for the job. Make sure to review your resume several times to make any necessary edits to ensure that it presents you in the best possible light.\n‍\n10. Complement your resume with a personalized cover letter\nFinally, to seal the deal, use your newly crafted resume and the original job description to create a custom cover letter. \nYou can use AI and ChatGPT to write a cover letter. Try a prompt like:\n\"Write a conversational cover letter for a job application as an [position] at [company] using the information below as a reference in 150 words or less.\" Then select \"shift + enter\" to start a new line and paste the job description and your resume. \n‍\nPro Tip: Want to save time while crafting unique cover letters for every job application? With the AI Cover Letter Generator, you can generate personalized cover letters by merging your resume and any job description with the click of a button—all thanks to advanced AI technology.\n‍\nCreate a tailored resume and cover letter, all in one place.\n‍\nUse Teal's AI for resume tailoring\nEven with the steps above, tailoring your resume doesn’t have to be a lengthy process. \nTeal’s resume tailoring AI will help you quickly identify the right keywords from the job description and seamlessly integrate them into your resume. The platform also gives you a Match Score to see how well your resume aligns with the job posting—so customizing your resume becomes easier and faster.\n‍\n‍\nTailored resume examples\nNow that you understand how to tailor your resume to a job, let's review some examples to see what this looks like in practice for different roles:\n‍\nTailoring a Customer Success Resume\nTitle: Customer Success Manager\nSample Job Description: We're seeking a highly motivated and experienced Customer Success Manager to join our team. \nThe ideal candidate will be responsible for spearheading customer success and retention initiatives, improving customer onboarding success rates, increasing customer satisfaction scores, and decreasing customer churn rates.

Writing a short resume often feels impossible. Balancing your experience and qualifications with the length of your content can leave you wondering how much is too much.\nBut here's the thing: hiring professionals don't have the time to read resume novels. Not only that, but an overly wordy resume can also be a red flag, signaling you’re not able to communicate or prioritize effectively.\nBut don't worry; shortening your resume doesn't mean sacrificing key skills. It's all about knowing what to include and what to leave out.\nBelow, you'll learn how to tell if your resume needs condensing. You'll also learn how to shorten a resume and the best tools for streamlining your content without compromising what you bring to the table.\nLooking to shorten your resume to include only relevant details? Sign up for Teal's free resume creator and do it quickly today.\n‍\nWhy you should shorten a resume\nPicture this: you're a recruiter combing through an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) with hundreds of resumes for just one position. Now, imagine you come across a resume with the correct skills, but... it's five pages long. Are you likely to give it more than a glance? Probably not. Frankly, you don't have the time.\nBut that's just one of the reasons why having a concise, impactful resume is so important. Shortening your resume and focusing on your most relevant qualifications also:\nShows that you understand what's most important for the job\nEnsures your key selling points are front and center\nMakes it easier for a hiring manager or recruiter to see you're a strong candidate at a glance\nShowcases your ability to communicate and prioritize detail\nElevates every word, ensuring relevance to a position description\n‍\nAnd while you might be thinking:\n\"But I have so much experience! How can I fit it all onto just a few pages?\"\nThe key is to remember your resume isn't meant to be an exhaustive list of all of your professional experience. Instead, it should showcase the top 10 percent of your experience that's 100 percent relevant to the job. That's it. There's no real rule around a one page resume or even two pages; the idea is to always focus on relevance.\n‍\nTeal Founder and CEO David Fano has this to say about the “rules” of resume length:\n\"If your resume is longer than one page, the first page should be interesting enough that potential employers want to keep reading. Each word should make them want to learn more about you.\n\nWhile the length of your resume isn't the most important thing—there aren't really any hard or fast rules—the content should give them a sense of your fit for the role.\"\n‍\n‍\nWhen to condense a resume\nNow that you understand the importance of a concise resume, you might wonder when it's time to start trimming.\n‍\nHere are some signs that your resume could benefit from a shorter resume:\nYour resume is over three pages long: How long should a resume be? Unless you're applying for an executive-level position or have an extensive list of publications or patents (for example, if you work in academia or the medical field), aim to keep your resume length concise, between one and three pages max.\nYou're including every job you've ever had: While it's important to highlight your experience, listing every position you've held since high school can clutter your resume and detract from your most relevant qualifications and recent experience.\nYour bullet points are lengthy and unfocused: If your resume bullet points read like paragraphs, it's time to cut them down. Each resume bullet point should be concise and specific, focusing on your key accomplishments and impact or results.\nYou're using small fonts or narrow margins: If you find yourself shrinking font size, minimizing line spacing, removing white space, or trimming the margins to squeeze in more content, that's a red flag. A hiring manager should be fine without a magnifying glass to read your resume.\nYou're including irrelevant or outdated information: If you're still listing your high school education and GPA or including hobbies that have no bearing on your professional life, it's time to cut the fluff.\n‍\nHow to shorten a resume\nSo, you've identified that your resume needs a trim. But where do you start?\nBelow are some tips for creating a concise, impactful resume:\n‍\nChoose the right resume format\nA modern resume format maximizes the available space to grab a hiring manager's attention. The most popular format is reverse chronological, focusing on your most recent and relevant experience first.\n\n‍\nOpt for a clean template\nAvoid templates with excessive graphics or decorative elements that take up valuable real estate.\n‍\nFocus on the last 10 to 15 years\nHow far back should a resume go? Unless you're applying for an executive-level position requiring exhaustive experience from over a decade ago, you generally don't need to include experience beyond fifteen years ago. Focus on your most recent and relevant roles.\n‍\nUse resume bullet points\nRather than writing paragraphs, use bullet points to highlight your key accomplishments and results. This makes your content more skimmable and easier to digest.\nPro Tip: Struggling to condense your paragraphs into resume bullet points? Try writing with AI.\nShorten Resume Bullet Points With AI\n‍\n‍\nTailor your content to the job \nOne of the best ways to keep your resume short and sweet is to tailor it to the specific job you're applying for. (Something you should do regardless of resume length.)\nRead the job description carefully and highlight the skills and experiences the employer seeks. Then, prioritize those details in your resume, cutting anything that's not relevant.\nCompare Your Resume to a Job\n‍\n\n‍\nHow to shorten your resume with Teal\nTeal can help you simplify creating a concise, impactful resume. Here's how to use the features and tools to make it shorter and more effective:\n‍\nStep 1: Upload your resume\nIf you haven't already done so, create a Teal account. Then, upload your current resume to Teal's platform with one click.\nDon't worry about the length; Teal can store your entire career history. After it's in the system, make sure all of your details have been parsed into the right sections.\n‍\nStep 2: Analyze your resume\nNext, analyze your current resume. Click \"Analysis\" at the top of the Resume Builder.\nTeal's Resume Analysis identifies areas for improvement in your content (for example, if your professional summary is too long or you're missing key metrics) to ensure your resume aligns with current best practices.\n‍\nThen, follow the suggestions to improve your Resume Score.\n‍\nStep 3: Toggle on (or off) details\nThink of Teal as a database where you store all of your work history. But because not everything you've done is relevant to each job, you can check (or uncheck) the boxes next to the experience, skills, and qualifications that make sense for a specific application.\nThis helps you create a targeted resume without starting from scratch or deleting any details that might be better suited for a different application.\n‍\n\n‍\nStep 4: Tailor your resume to every job description\nEvery job posting has different skills, qualifications, language, and expectations—even when they have the same title.\nTeal's Resume Job Description Match tool compares your resume to a specific job listing, giving you a Match Score to show you how well your skills, experiences, and language align with a unique position's requirements.\n‍\nStep 5: Optimize your resume content:\nOnce you have a Match Score, you'll want to get it to 60 to 75%. You can do this using Teal's Job Description Keywords as a guide.\nWith a Teal membership, you get the top five hard skills to incorporate, while Teal+ offers unlimited keywords and skills for every unique job.\nStrategically incorporate the suggestions into your professional summary, skills, and bullet points to show your fit for the role, improve your visibility to recruiters, and increase your Match Score.\n\n‍\nExamples of shortened resume sections\nTo show the impact of condensing your resume, here are some before-and-after examples of common resume sections.\n‍\nProfessional Summary\nBefore\nExperienced marketing professional with a proven track record of developing and executing successful marketing campaigns across various industries.

One of the most important details of a well-designed resume is the margin size. Proper margins can help ensure that your resume looks polished and is easy to read, while incorrect margins can make your document appear cluttered and unprofessional.\n\nIn this article, we'll discuss everything you need to know about resume margins, including what size to use, how to set them on different tools, and tips for formatting your document to create the best possible impression with potential employers. Let's dive in!\n\n‍\n\nWhat are resume margins?\nResume margins are the blank spaces that are left between the edges of the document and the text within it. They determine the amount of white space on a resume and can affect the overall visual appeal and readability of the document.\n\nAppropriate margins in your resume can help create a balanced and visually pleasing layout that highlights your qualifications and presents them in the best possible light.\n\n‍\n\nWhy are resume margins important?\nResume margins are important for several reasons:\n\nAesthetics: The margins help to give your resume a clean and professional look. A well-formatted resume with proper margins looks visually pleasing and makes a good first impression on the recruiter or hiring manager.\nReadability: Adequate margins ensure that your resume is easy to read and doesn't look cluttered. It also provides enough space for the recruiter to add comments and notes.\nSpace utilization: By adjusting the margins, you can optimize the space on your resume and highlight important information.\nPrinter-friendly: Proper resume margins ensure that your resume prints correctly without any cutting off or overlapping of text.\nThe margins play an important role in the appearance and readability of your resume, making it easier for recruiters to scan and assess your qualifications and experience.\n\n‍\n\nWhat is the standard resume margin size?\nThe size of standard resume margins is typically one inch margins on all sides. This margin size provides sufficient white space, making the resume easy to read and visually appealing. It also allows for the inclusion of important information such as your name, contact details, and professional summary at the top of the page, without making the resume look cluttered or cramped.\n\nWhile some resume formats may use slightly different margin sizes, like 0.5 inch margins to fit more content onto a single page, it's important to find a balance between including enough information and maintaining readability and organization.\n\n‍\n\nHow to format resume margins\nFormatting resume margins is an essential aspect of creating a professional-looking resume. Margins not only affect the visual appearance of your resume but also impact its readability. The job of your resume is to get you in the door, so make sure you set proper resume margins to catch the eye of recruiters and hiring managers.\n\n‍\n\nHow to set resume margins on popular tools\nHow you set margins on your resume varies depending on the tool you use.

In this section, we'll explore the ideal margin settings for different types of resumes to help you make the best impression possible.\n\n‍\n\nBasic resumes\nWhen creating a basic resume, it's important to keep the margins consistent and professional-looking. Here are some general guidelines for setting margins on a basic resume:\n\nSet the margin size to 1 inch on all sides. This is the default margin size in most word processing programs, and it ensures that your resume looks clean and professional.\nIf you need to fit more information on your resume, you can reduce the margin size to 0.5 inches on all sides. However, be sure to test print your resume to ensure that all important information is still visible and that the resume still looks professional.\nAvoid setting the margin size too small (less than 0.5 inches) or too large (more than 1 inch) as this can make your resume look unprofessional or difficult to read.\nRemember that the most important thing is to ensure that your resume is easy to read and looks professional. Consistent and appropriate margins can help achieve this.\n\n‍\n\nCreative resumes\nWhen creating a graphically enhanced,  creative resume, you have more flexibility with the margins, as the design elements of the resume can extend into the margins.\n\nWith this in mind, it's generally recommended to use a margin size of at least 0.5 inches to ensure that the content of your resume is well-contained and doesn't appear cramped. This margin size allows for some design elements to extend beyond the printable area.\n\nIf you're using a lot of graphical elements in your resume, such as charts, graphs, or images, you may want to increase the margin size slightly to provide more whitespace and balance out the design.\n\nUltimately, the margin size should be chosen based on what looks visually appealing and helps to showcase your skills and qualifications in the most effective way possible. However, it's important to keep in mind that the text and important information should still be within the printable area of the page, so the document isn't rejected by applicant tracking systems.\n\nPro-tip: Explore Teal's collection of creative resume templates to get started!\n\n‍\n\nResume text alignment best practices\nYour resume should be left-aligned, also referred to as \"flush left\" or \"align left\". Left-alignment is standard for official and professional documents, like resumes. That means that the text, like your titles and bullet points, is aligned to the left margin and is not justified on both sides.\n\nUsing left alignment creates a clean and professional look, and it is easy to read and scan. Additionally, left alignment makes it easier for the reader to quickly locate important information, such as your job titles, employment dates, and education credentials.\n\nThere is a more mixed consensus as to whether or not you should center any text, but we recommend erring on the side of left-justifying everything. Centering your text may make your resume seem more cluttered and look less organized.  \n\nWhen your alignment is consistent throughout the document, it ensures white space is used effectively. This helps create balance and improve readability.\n\n‍\n\nBest resume formatting tips\nWhen it comes to crafting an effective resume, formatting is just as important as the content itself. A well-formatted resume can help you stand out from the competition and showcase your qualifications as an ideal candidate.\n\nIn this section, we will explore some of the best resume formatting tips to help you create a professional and eye-catching resume that gets noticed by potential employers.\n\n‍\n\nFont\nWhether serif or sans serif fonts, the font used on a resume matters because it can influence the reader's perception of the job seeker and their qualifications.\n\nWhen choosing a resume font, consider the industry you're applying to, the type of job you're seeking, and your personal brand. To ensure your resume is easy to read, choose traditional resume fonts like Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri. If you want to showcase more of a creative personality, try Didot, Lato, or Montserrat.\n\nWhat about size? We recommend following these guidelines:\n\nYour name at the top can be 18 to 24 points so it stands out but doesn't take up too much resume space\nCreate headings between 12 and 16 points\nGenerally, stay between a 10- and 12-point font size for resume body text\n‍\n\nHeader\nThe header of your resume is the first thing a potential employer will see, so it's important to make it stand out. Use a clear, easy-to-read font for your name and contact information, and consider making it slightly larger than the rest of the text on your resume. Make sure your header is consistent with the rest of your resume in terms of formatting and spacing.\n\nTo make your resume even more compelling, consider including a hyperlink to your LinkedIn profile or personal website. This provides potential employers with additional ways to learn about your professional background and skills, and can help you make a strong impression as a candidate.\n\n‍\n\nFooter\nWhile a footer is not strictly necessary on a resume, it's essential to keep it simple and informative if including one. For experienced professionals with resumes more than one page in length, the footer is a great place to include page numbers.\n\nHowever, if you choose not to include a footer, that is also perfectly acceptable. This allows more space to include all necessary information in the body of the document.\n\n‍\n\nSpacing\nWhen creating a professional resume, it's important to pay attention to spacing. Consistency is key in creating an organized and visually pleasing page layout. To achieve this, it's best to use the same amount of space between each section and bullet point, and avoid too much white space or overcrowding your text. Additionally, using bullet points can be a great way to break up long paragraphs and create an easy-to-read resume.\n\nAnother factor to consider when formatting your resume is white space. By using white space effectively, you can make your resume more scannable and visually appealing.\n\n‍\n\nLength\nWhen it comes to resume length, it's important to strike the right balance between providing enough information to showcase your skills and accomplishments, and keeping the document concise and easy to read.\n\nAs a general rule, most employers prefer resumes that are one page to two pages long, so it's important to prioritize the most relevant information and avoid including unnecessary details.\n\n‍\n\nCreate a winning resume with Teal\nPaying attention to resume margins is a crucial part of creating a polished and professional resume. By using the right margin size, spacing, and formatting techniques, you can create a document that showcases your skills and qualifications in the best possible light.\n\nIf you're looking for an easy and efficient way to craft a winning resume, consider using Teal's AI Resume Builder.

It deserves a refresh at least once per year, or sooner if you've experienced a significant shift in focus, responsibilities, or industry. Updating your resume means it will more accurately reflect your current qualifications and future career goals.\nHere are some common signs your resume is outdated and needs a revamp:\nOutdated information: Does your resume still list your college internship (when you’re 15 years into your career) or a job you left years ago? Consider removing past roles that aren’t directly related to your current goals.\nMissing skills: Have you mastered new skills since last writing your resume? If your skillset has significantly expanded, your resume needs to as well.\nCareer change: Have you transitioned to a new industry or do you want to? Tailor your resume to align with the specific skills and experience valued in your target industry or role.\nGeneric content: Do your bullet points feel too weak or like they’re rehashing the job description? Consider updating your resume with strong action verbs and concrete results.\nFormatting issues: Does your resume have photos, graphics, or fancy fonts? While it may make sense to have an aesthetic document to send directly to hiring managers in a creative industry, in most cases, you want a clean, ATS-friendly resume for job applications.\nIf you're not sure when to revamp your resume, this guide on how to update a resume can provide some insights.\n‍\nHow to revamp your resume\nWhether you're considering a career change, looking for a new role within your field, or simply haven't updated your resume recently, chances are it might be time for a revamp.\n‍\n1.

If you’re looking to get a higher-paying job in your field, focus on showing your technical and leadership  experience along with professional achievements you can directly tie to business results. If you’re making a career pivot, adapt the language to highlight your transferable skills.\n‍\nWork experience\nPrioritize your most recent and relevant experience first, tailoring descriptions to highlight skills and accomplishments directly related to the job you're targeting.\n‍\nSkills\nAnalyze the job description and identify the skills most relevant to the desired position (Teal’s Matching Mode can help with this!). Be sure to include a mix of hard skills and soft skills.\n‍\nEducation and certifications\nIf it’s been a while since you graduated, consider removing your graduation year.

Optimize your resume format and design\nClean, professional resumes helps you make a strong first impression on employers. Your resume will be more readable for both human reviewers and applicant tracking systems with a clean layout with clear headings, bullet points, and consistent formatting.\nOftentimes, you won’t get the chance to meet with the recruiter unless your resume at least passes the first stage of review in the job application process.\nTeal’s Resume Builder Design Mode can assist with formatting. In this section of the Resume Builder, you get to choose from a variety of resume templates, change the styling options and layout, reorder sections, or change detailed settings, like line height and borders.\nHowever you style your resume, you can feel confident knowing Teal’s designs are ATS-friendly.\n‍\n4. Proofread and edit your resume\nProofreading is the final polish on your resume to make it shine and create a strong first impression.\nTo proofread your resume effectively, you can start with a free grammar and spell-checking tool to catch simple mistakes. Also, be sure to read through a few times (perhaps out loud) to see how it flows. If time permits, take a break from your resume and come back to it later with fresh eyes to see if you want to make any additional changes.\n‍\n5. Get feedback and make necessary adjustments\nAfter revamping your resume, it’s a good idea to get feedback from a third party to make sure you’ve hit the mark before sending it to an employer. You can ask a trusted friend or colleague, hire a resume reviewer, or use an online resume review tool.\nFor suggestions you can implement right away, Teal's Resume Analysis feature gives you instant feedback on a variety of areas and helps you make improvements to your resume.\n‍\n6. Tailor to each job description\nTailoring your resume to each job description makes your resume more ATS-friendly so hiring managers can quickly search resumes for the specific skills they want.

Generative AI tools like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT are great at coming up with new ideas, rephrasing sentences, or providing a starting point for your writing.\nNote: Sometimes AI-generated writing sounds similar when the prompts words are similar, so always be sure to edit whatever writing you create with AI.

For job seekers in software development or software engineering, the answer is a GitHub profile. \nWith GitHub, programmers can collaborate with other programmers to design and improve source code. Along those lines, GitHub lets developers manage and store different versions of projects.\nIn this guide, you will learn how to put GitHub on a resume in a variety of ways, how to improve your GitHub profile so you stand out during the hiring process, and how Teal’s Resume Builder can help put it all together for you.\nStruggling to land interviews? Build a resume that gets results with Teal.\n‍\nShould you put GitHub on your resume?\nIf you don’t know the difference between a portfolio and a resume, no worries. GitHub can act as your portfolio.\nFor job seekers in software development or software engineering, including software engineers, adding GitHub to your resume is not a requirement, but it can be a valuable way to showcase your skills to potential employers.\n‍\nBenefits to adding GitHub to your resume\nCommitment: This shows potential employers you’re proactive and committed to your career. It sets you apart from other candidates who either don’t have a profile or have a poor GitHub profile.\nSkill set: Hiring managers will have a chance to explore your projects. A GitHub profile demonstrates you know how to do the work, not just how to talk about it.\nCollaboration: Because GitHub is open source, recruiters and future employers will see projects you've contributed to, showcasing your collaboration skills.\n‍\nChecklist before you add a GitHub link to your resume \nEven if you know the importance of a Github profile on your resume, it still may not be the right fit for you. Ensure the following is accurate:\nProfessional: Do you have a polished profile with a professional photo and username? You’ll want to make a good impression with this profile, much like you would with your resume, LinkedIn profile, or on an interview.\nActive: Is your GitHub account active? Do you have projects you’re proud of? Consider contributing to popular open-source projects before adding a GitHub link to the resume. \nRelevant: Do the projects on your GitHub profile show your experience? Are you using programming languages relevant to the job you’re applying to? Consider adding projects that leverage relevant code before moving forward.\n‍\nHow to add GitHub on your resume\nHere’s a step-by-step guide on how to add GitHub to your resume. But first, you may wonder which GitHub link to use for your resume.\n‍\nHow to get your GitHub link for your resume\nGo to Github.com\nLog into your profile, then click on your profile picture or avatar (top right corner).\nOn your profile page, look for the URL in the address bar of your browser. This is your GitHub profile URL.\nIt’ll look something like this: \ngithub.com/yourname\nNote: If your profile name and URL slug are not your full name, consider updating your profile name to make it more professional and easier to find.\nNow, you have a few placement options for your GitHub link:\nSkills \nProjects\nWork experience\nHeader\n‍\nHow to add GitHub to your resume skills\nIf you're applying for a position that involves coding or programming, list those skills in your Skills section. This should help boost your resume’s relevance in the Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) if the hiring manager is looking for GitHub keywords. It will also help clarify your experience and highlight your technical skills.\nCategorize your skills into groups like programming languages, tools, or operating systems. List core competencies under each category. Then, include a link to a specific GitHub project that best demonstrates the specific skill.\n‍\nGitHub resume example in Skills section‍\nPro Tip: Use Teal’s free Resume Creator to store all of your skills in one place. With Teal you can categorize each skill by type (and toggle them on and off or add new skills whenever you need to!).\n‍\n‍\nHow to add GitHub to your resume projects\nA dedicated Projects section in a resume is a great way to show real-world work you’ve completed and don’t have room to share on your resume. It’s similar to a work portfolio but condensed for a resume. \nYou may not have an exciting GitHub profile, but rather just one large project completed. Generally speaking, if you have something you can show off from beginning to end, rather than multiple projects you’ve contributed to, this is a great route for you.\nCreate a separate section of your resume titled “Projects.” Use the following GitHub resume template to guide you through creating your project.\n‍\nGitHub resume template for Projects section\nProject Name | Your Role | Dates\n\nGitHub link\n\nDescription of the project\n\nBullet point: technologies and languages used\n\nBullet Point: Achievement #1\n\nBullet Point: Achievement #2\n‍\nGitHub resume example in Projects section\n‍\nHow to add GitHub to your resume work experience\nYour Work Experience section takes the bulk of your resume space. This is where you'll want to list where you were employed and how you contributed to the team. When describing your professional experience, you have many opportunities to showcase your technical skills. When describing your professional experience, you can also highlight how you maintain code on GitHub, showcasing your commitment to keeping your projects up-to-date and well-documented.\nEither include your link underneath the role title or within a job duty bullet point. You want to highlight it in a way that emphasizes its relevance to your professional experience.\n‍\nGitHub resume example in Work Experience section\nStruggling to write about your achievements? Teal’s AI Bullet Point tool helps you write about your coding achievements in seconds, using metric-rich statements.\nCreate Your Achievements with Teal\n‍\nHow to add GitHub to your resume header\nThe simplest place to add a link is in your header. This section is displayed across the top of your resume and typically includes your contact information. This makes the link easy to find.\nAlong with your contact information, write out your profile URL. For example, you might write:\ngithub.io/yourname\n‍\nGitHub resume example in header\n‍\nGitHub on resume example\nIn summary, you can plug in your Github profile link in many different areas on your resume. However, that doesn’t mean you should plug your Github profile URL on every single possible option. That would be redundant and make your resume feel cluttered. \nInstead, choose just one or two areas to highlight your Github profile. In this GitHub resume example, you can see GitHub highlighted in two sections: the general profile placed within the Header and a repository link placed within the Projects section. This provides whoever is viewing the resume with options—without overwhelming them or keyword stuffing.\n\n‍\nStruggling to format your resume? Within Teal’s Resume Builder, simply add your information (or import info from your LinkedIn profile) to get started. Then let the Resume Design feature do the hard work for you. Customize the style, format, and presentation with just a few clicks.\n‍\nTips to make your GitHub profile stand out to hiring managers\nIt’s important to ensure your profile is attractive and ready to be seen by recruiters and hiring managers. If you would like GitHub listed on your resume, keep these tips in mind.\n‍\nKeep GitHub updated\nKeep your profile and your code updated and appealing. That means ensure it has your correct information. Also, be sure to remove or make private any broken code or old projects. \nEnsure your GitHub profile is professional with a professional-looking headshot and ensure all the public projects are things you would want employers to see. \nIf you have a very active profile, you can gain badges, stars, and achievements to show off on your profile. This will show potential employers you are dedicated and collaborative.\n‍\nPay attention to repositories\nGitHub provides the option to maintain multiple repositories for different coding projects. You can make each repository public or private. \nGo through your profile and either remove or make private any code you don’t want a potential employer to see. Additionally, you can pin your proudest repositories to the top of your profile, making it easy for visitors to see your best work. \nThis link to your GitHub projects will look something like this:\nhttps://yourname.github.io/repo-name\n‍\nAdd a README of GitHub\nSometimes, showing the code is not enough. By creating a README file, you have a chance to explain the code, the project, and any other important notes. This will help hiring managers understand what they are looking at.\n‍\nCommon GitHub mistakes to avoid\nIt’s not enough to simply know how to put GitHub on your resume. To up your chances at impressing your audience, you need to optimize your profile and put your best foot forward.\nHere are some common mistakes to avoid before you move ahead with sending out those resumes with your GitHub profile attached. \nBroken code: A profile with bad or broken code could harm you more than help you. Make sure your public projects are all your best work. \nInactivity: While this may not be fair, a profile with long breaks in activity can cause potential employers to doubt your dedication. If you took breaks, explain those gaps much like you would a gap in employment.\nPrivate projects: It’s a small mistake, but could add a big break in momentum if a hiring manager views your profile only to be met with nothing. Make sure each project you linked to in your resume is publicly available on GitHub.\nSensitive information: You should also avoid including any projects you are not authorized to reveal.\n‍\nHow to format GitHub on your resume\nNow that you understand the potential, Teal’s Design Mode can assist with formatting your resume so you can easily add links to your resume and put it all together.\nAs a recap, you might list your GitHub profile in:\nSkills section\nProjects section\nYour work experience section\nYour resume header\nUsing Teal's Resume Builder, you can add and edit your resume sections as needed. Within the “Design” menu and the “Sections” tab, it’s easy to rename or rearrange the information on your resume by simply clicking and dragging the different section blocks. \nIn this section of the Resume Builder, you get to choose from a variety of resume templates, change the styling options and layout, reorder sections, or change detailed settings, like line height and borders.\n‍\nShowcase your Github achievements with Teal\nIf you’re looking for a tech job in today’s competitive developer job market, contributing to open source projects via GitHub can help you stand out from the competition. When you know how to put GitHub on your resume the right way, you set yourself up as a dedicated, capable professional. Hopefully, this guide gave you the GitHub skills you need to showcase projects and stand out to hiring managers.\nIf you feel stressed about resume writing during your job search, you don’t have to start from scratch.

You need work experience to get a job but you need a job before you can gain enough work experience.\nIf you’re a recent graduate or someone without a lot of career history, including an internship on a resume bolsters your practical experience, lowering that initial barrier of entry.\nWhile movies would have you believe that internships are not serious or career-defining, the data shows they carry real weight with employers. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, an internship within the same industry is the most influential factor when a company is deciding between two similarly qualified candidates.\nWondering how to list an internship on a resume? This guide has the details you need to understand why, where, and when to list your internships on a resume.\nTurn your internship experience into a compelling resume. Get started with Teal's free Resume Builder.\n‍\nWhy should you include an internship on your resume?\nWhile it’s easy to discount internships and think of them as poor substitutes for professional experience, these experiences can be the difference between newly employeed and second choice.\nInternships equip you with relevant experience in a specific field, provide the opportunity to forge connections within your industry, and help you build a solid knowledge base and transferable skills with hands-on practice in a real-world setting.\nPlus, committing your time and energy to an internship—especially one that coincides with your education—shows employers that you are ambitious and eager to learn, grow, and gain skills that will positively impact your career and the success of your employer. When companies actively hire for a growth mindset, highlighting that drive and motivation helps you stand out.\nThat said, if you have several years of professional experience under your belt, you’ll likely remove internships from your resume and dedicate that space to your formal and full-time work experience. \nUltimately, whether or not to include internships on your resume is a judgment call. Here are some circumstances when it’s best to list them:\nWhen you’re a recent grad or entry-level employee looking for your first job without a lot of other work experience\nWhen you’re changing careers or switching to a new industry and took a related internship to gain knowledge and exposure\nWhen you interned with a company that’s a big and noteworthy name in your industry (for example, you work in tech and took an engineering internship at Google)\nWhen you interned for the company you’re applying to\nLike any other aspects of your professional history, relevance and recency matter. If an internship is more than a decade old, it’s time to remove it from your resume and fill that space with a more up-to-date or pertinent position. \n‍\nWhere to put an internship on your resume\nYour internship experience can be incorporated in several different places on your document. You might list your internships in:\nYour work experience section\nA separate section dedicated to internships\nYour resume summary\nWith Teal's Resume Builder, you can add and edit your resume sections as needed. Within the “Design” menu and the “Sections” tab, it’s easy to rename or rearrange the information on your resume by simply clicking and dragging the different section blocks. \n\n‍\nHere’s a closer look at each of those three sections and how to effectively showcase your internship experience in each.\n‍\nWork experience section\nIn most cases, your internships are listed in your work experience section. Your internships can be incorporated with other paid positions in this section, and you’ll sort your jobs in reverse-chronological order.\n‍\nInternship on a resume example 1\n‍\nDedicated internship section\nIf you have several internships or want to separate them from the rest of your work experience, you can create a dedicated internship section.\nPulling your internships out into their own section can make it easier to highlight them, especially if they’d otherwise be listed with an assortment of less relevant jobs. \nIn a separate internship section, you can list all of your internship experiences in reverse-chronological order with plenty of detail, while putting your part-time and other positions in a less-detailed section underneath.\n‍\nInternship on a resume example 2‍\nResume summary\nWhile you won’t give a detailed rundown of your duties and responsibilities in this spot, you can also incorporate a mention of your internship (and some related achievements) in your resume summary.\nThis short paragraph goes at the top of your resume and highlights your top qualifications, relevant skills, and impressive accomplishments. Here’s an example that incorporates an internship: \n‍\n‍\nStruggling to write your summary? Teal’s Resume Summary Generator will do the hard work for you.

Check out this detailed guide to learn how to write a cover letter for an internship.\n‍\nHow to list an internship on your resume\nRegardless of how you choose to structure your internship resume, there are several formatting rules and best practices that always apply. Every internship listing should include the same basic information:\nJob title or internship title (e.g. “Marketing Intern”)\nCompany name\nDates of employment\nBullet points that detail your duties and relevant accomplishments\nMuch like any other job listing, you also need to remember the importance of relevance. Take a close look at the job description to pull out keywords, technical skills, soft skills, and other qualifications the employer emphasizes. Those are details you should incorporate into your own resume (provided you  possess them). Potential employers want to know how your experience satisfies the position requirements, and the perfect resume will connect those dots for them. \nReady to create an internship resume that adequately captures all of your relevant skills and accomplishments? Take a look at the internship scenarios below to understand how to properly list them on your resume.\n‍\nHow to list a current internship on a resume\nIf you’re currently working an internship, you’ll list the basic details of that job. However, instead of sharing an end date for your internship, you’ll write “present.” You should also use present tense for the action verbs that start each of your bullet points.\n‍\n‍\nHow to list a past internship on a resume\nListing your past internship on your resume is similar to listing a current one, with a few exceptions:\nYou’ll share the end date (month and year) that you stopped working that internship\nYou’ll use past tense for your action verbs, as those are no longer present responsibilities\n‍\nPast internship on a resume example\n‍\nHow to list an incoming internship on a resume\nWhat if you’re creating a resume and want to include a future internship—meaning one you’ve accepted an offer for but haven’t officially started yet? \nInstead of the typical date range attached to a position, you’ll write “Anticipated Start Date” or “Expected Start Date” with the month and year you plan to start your internship. If you have an end date (for example, if it’s a summer internship that ends in August), you can list that too.\nListing job duties is tougher in this situation, as you haven’t worked in the position yet. Revisit the job description to pull out the major responsibilities you’ll handle in that job. Remember to use the present tense for those duties rather than the past tense.\n‍\n‍\nWhen listing an upcoming internship, include an “Expected” or “Anticipated” start date and refer to the job description when writing your bullet points.\nPro tip: Teal's Matching Mode feature surfaces the most relevant skills and other keywords from every job description for you to use in your resume.\nMatch Your Resume to the JD\n‍\n‍\nLooking for more tips on listing upcoming roles? Check out this guide on how to write an incoming job on your resume.\n‍\nHow to list multiple internships on a resume\nIf you’ve held multiple internships (and they’re all within the last 10 years and relevant to the job you’re applying for) but not many other professional jobs, you can list multiple internships on your resume. Again, it’s up to you whether you break them out into their own section or incorporate them in your work experience section.\n‍\nWhen listing multiple internships, remember to:\nList them in reverse-chronological order, with your most recent one at the top\nInclude more bullet points and detail with more recent internships and less with older internships\nUse the present tense for current or future internships and the past tense for previous internships\n‍\nHere’s an example of what a resume with several internships can look like: \n‍\n‍\nIf you have multiple internships, list them on your resume in reverse-chronological order.\nTeal's resume creator can take some of the complexity out of the classic “internship on resume” puzzle. Using the AI feature, you can automatically generate work achievements and a professional summary. Teal can also give you expert suggestions to make your resume even stronger and compare your document to the job description to offer targeted suggestions about which keywords to include.\nBrowse the template options to find the right internship resume template for you and then use the design options to customize your font, alignment, section order, and more. Put simply, you don’t need a professional resume writer if you have Teal.\n‍\n6 common mistakes to avoid when listing internships on resumes\nThe above internship resume examples will help you get all of your relevant information down on paper. But to create an internship resume that stands out to hiring managers, there are a few common resume mistakes to know and avoid.\n‍\n1. Ignoring the employer’s directions\nTake a close look at the job posting to see if there are any specific instructions. Sometimes potential employers will provide explicit directions—such as including the contact information for your intern supervisor with your internship listings. Failing to follow those directions makes the hiring manager far more likely to pass on your application.\n‍\n2. Including irrelevant experience\nWhen you don’t have years of formal work experience behind you, it’s tempting to include every single one of your intern job duties to beef up your document. But as with anything else, quality is more important than quantity. Use the job posting as your guide to include only the most relevant skills and experiences on your resume.\n‍\n3. Exaggerating your responsibilities\nSimilarly, resist the temptation to lie or over-inflate your responsibilities and contributions. While you absolutely should quantify your achievements and demonstrate your impact, there’s no need to lie on a resume.\nHiring managers don’t expect you to be well versed in your industry or responsible for making major company decisions. There’s no shame in answering phones and providing general assistance. Those tasks just may not be the ones you add to your resume, unless you improved those processes or used them to contribute to business growth.\n‍\n4. Failing to quantify achievements\nThat doesn’t mean the descriptions of your summer internships should be generic. You can be honest while still using numbers and metrics to show the ultimate impact of your work. Teal’s AI Achievement Generator within the Resume Builder can automatically generate results-first bullet points to use on your resume.\nWrite a Better Resume with AI\n‍\n‍\nIf you’re starting an internship soon, take this as a reminder to keep notes about what you achieve in that position. Those details will be invaluable when you write future resumes.\n‍\n5. Forgetting to update\nYour career is ever-evolving—and so is your resume. While internships might carry a lot of weight on your resume when you’re just getting started (or are making a career change), they won’t have as much pull when you have several years of experience. If you’re 10 years in and still have your first internship on your resume, it’s time to make some updates.\n‍\n6. Neglecting your education section\nMost people work internships while they’re attending college or pursuing some other education. So, while it’s not a direct part of your internship listings, remember to also give your education section some focus and attention. \nInclude your degrees, relevant coursework, and other related professional development opportunities to complement your internship on your resume. That’s another way to show the hiring manager you have existing skills and knowledge to bring to the position, even if you don’t yet have a lot of formal work experience. \nAvoid these mistakes and your resume will stand a better chance of scoring you an interview. When that happens, get prepared with these common internship interview questions.\n‍\nShowcase your internship experience with Teal\nGone are the days when interns were glorified coffee fetchers. Today, internships are valuable career stepping stones that can equip you with the skills, experience, knowledge, and connections you need to thrive in a new job.\nIt’s up to your resume to showcase everything you took away from your internship and prove to hiring managers that you not only have the “real-world experience” they keep asking for, you also know how to make the most of every opportunity.

It's the first step in identifying qualified applicants from a pool of applicants. On average, job openings receive 250 applications, and it can take between 21 and 80 applications for an applicant to get an offer. \nIn other words, the job market is hyper-competitive\nThe resume screening process is the first step in identifying qualified candidates from a pool of applicants.\nMost large companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to scan resumes. An ATS looks for required keywords, experience, and skills before a human recruiter manually reads your application. That's why optimizing your resume to pass through resume screening software is essential to land an interview.\nAI resume builders can help you format your resume to pass through ATS screening systems. A good AI resume tool can also analyze job descriptions to identify the right keywords to include on your resume. Both features work together to ensure your resume can be read by resume screening tools and humans.\nIn this guide, you'll learn exactly how the screening process works and how to use that knowledge to your advantage.\n‍\nStruggling to pass resume screening? Make a free resume that's ATS- friendly and optimized with Teal.\n‍\nWhat is resume screening?\nThe resume screening process is important for job seekers and hiring managers. It's the process of quickly filtering large applicant pools to identify the most promising candidates.\nThere are a few main types of resume screening:\n‍\n1. Manual resume screening\nIn manual screening, a recruiter or hiring manager will review each resume submitted for a role.\nBased on the job description, they skim through the document for relevant qualifications, skills, and experience. This is effective for getting an initial sense of a candidate's qualifications and background when there's a low volume of applicants for a role.\n‍\n‍\nThat said, screening and reviewing resumes in this way can be time-consuming and inconsistent when dealing with a high volume of applicants. For that reason, it's not a realistic option for large companies.\n‍\n2. Automated resume screening\nMany companies use an ATS to automate the initial resume screening.\nThese tools scan resumes for keywords, years of experience, education, and other criteria set by the employer. Rather than exclude any candidates, they will screen resumes and shortlist the ones that best match the job requirements.\n‍\n‍\nWhile very efficient, automated systems may overlook strong applicants who don't have the exact credentials defined in the screening rules set by recruiters.\n‍\n3. AI resume screening\nThe latest advancement in resume screening technology is artificial intelligence (AI).\nAI-powered resume scanners can holistically analyze a candidate's employment history to find the right candidates, with the right skills and experience. AI screening considers subtle details like language proficiency, knowledge of industry terms, and other soft qualifications.\nThis provides more nuanced screening than keyword searches alone. AI systems continuously learn and improve their screening accuracy over time.\nTo see how our AI-driven tool can help you optimize your resume, explore our resume parsing feature to understand how it ingests and segments resume content.\n‍\nThe rise of AI resume screening\nAI resume tools analyze applicant information and data to filter and rank submissions automatically. Rather than relying solely on recruiters to manually review applications, companies are turning to AI-powered software to streamline the first round of screening. \n‍\nHow AI resume screening works\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a broad category that includes the development of systems capable of performing tasks at a human level. Natural language processing (NLP) is a subset of AI that focuses on helping humans and computers interact more efficiently using natural language.\nAs such, NLP is frequently used by resume screening tools to prioritize candidates that can best “talk-the-talk” on their text-based application materials. \nNLP identifies key skills, experience, and other qualifications mentioned in a resume and compares them to the job description. Algorithms then score and shortlist candidates who best match the required criteria, automating a traditionally time-consuming task.\nLarge applicant pools that once took days or weeks to even screen candidates can now be processed within hours. By removing less qualified resumes from the pipeline early on, recruiters are free to focus their efforts on the best potential hires.\nSince AI focuses on keywords, you (as the job seeker) need to include relevant hard and soft skills, certifications, and industry terms specific to the role. \nOnce the content is primed for a resume screening, be sure to use a clean layout with consistent formatting to avoid confusing the AI parser.\nFollowing these tips will help you understand how to optimize your resume for ATS.\n‍\nHow to pass resume screening with AI resume software\nTo successfully navigate the automated resume screening tools used in the hiring process, consider the following tips:\n‍\n1. Optimize your resume for automated resume screening\nAutomated resume screening tools rely on job-related keywords to efficiently review candidate resumes within the applicant tracking system (ATS).\nTo increase your chances of passing this automated screening process, tailor your resume to the job post and include keywords that align with the specific requirements, skills, and qualifications outlined in the job description. Take the time to carefully review the job posting and identify the keywords and phrases that the employer values the most.\nOne of the easiest ways to identify and add keywords to your resume is with Teal’s Matching Mode.\n‍\nAdd Keywords to Resume\n‍\nMatching Mode pulls out keywords from the job description you’re working with so you can strategically add them to your resume and cover letter. \nBe sure to strategically incorporate these keywords throughout your resume, especially in the skills and qualifications sections. That said, it's important to maintain a natural flow and avoid keyword stuffing.\nPro Tip: List key competencies in a dedicated skills section. This allows the automated system to quickly identify your relevant skills, increasing the chances of making it to the next stage.\n‍\n2. Broaden your job application scope\nWhen it comes to job hunting, many good candidates limit themselves to roles where they meet all the qualifications.\nWhile it's important to target positions that match your skill set, broadening your job application scope by considering roles where you are reasonably qualified can significantly enhance your chances of progressing through the initial resume screening phase in the recruitment process.\nTherefore, don't be discouraged if you don't match all the qualifications perfectly. Job requirements listed in job postings are often a wish list for an ideal candidate. Employers understand that finding someone who exactly meets every criterion and are within the salary range and desired location (if onsite) may be challenging.\nInstead, focus on highlighting your transferable skills, relevant experiences, and a genuine passion for the role and industry. When applying for positions where you don't meet all the requirements, use your resume and cover letter to showcase your adaptability, willingness to learn, and potential to thrive in the role. Emphasize your accomplishments and experiences that demonstrate your capability to excel in a similar position, even if it is in a different context or industry.\nBy broadening your job application scope, you increase your chances of making it past the initial resume screening phase and open yourself up to new opportunities and potential growth.\n‍\n3. Enhance resume readability for human and computer review\nUse proper resume formatting techniques to enhance readability for automated resume screening tools and human review.\nSelect an ATS-friendly template and structure that facilitates easy and effective resume screening and parsing during the resume review stage of the recruitment process.\nWith these strategies, you can optimize your resume to effectively navigate the ATS and automated resume screening processes, thereby increasing your chances of advancing.\nTeal's AI-powered Resume Builder can help with all of these steps to pass resume screening.

It uses advanced AI to analyze the job posting and identify the most important skills, qualifications, and requirements.\nMatching Mode works by scanning your existing resume content and comparing it against the target job description.\nBased on this analysis, Matching Mode will highlight keywords in your resume that align with the role. It also suggests new keywords you can add to boost your application's match score.\n‍\nTry Matching Mode\n‍\n\n‍\nThe key benefit of Matching Mode is that it rapidly improves the relevance of your resume to the job. Ensuring critical keywords are included increases the chances of your resume being made through automated screening systems as recruiters immediately see you have the required competencies.\nExample use case for Matching Mode:\nIf you are applying for a Digital Marketing Manager role, Matching Mode will highlight all occurrences of relevant terms like \"SEM\", \"Marketing\", \"Automation\" etc. \nIt identifies where your experience matches the job criteria.\nThe tool also recommends adding any missing keywords from the job description you should include in your resume, such as \"campaign budgeting,\" \"lead generation,\" or \"CRM platforms.\"\nMatching Mode significantly improves your match score by optimizing your resume vocabulary for each specific application.

Analysis Mode transforms your resume into a professional, recruiter-friendly document optimized for screening.\n‍\nTry Analysis Mode\n‍\nOptimize your resume for screenings\nGetting your resume past the initial screening stage is critical to landing an interview and job offer.\nResume screening has become an integral part of the hiring and recruiting process now, with the majority of companies using some form of automated filtering software to handle the high volume of applicants.\nWhile this can seem daunting, understanding the resume screening process and leveraging tools like AI resume builders can significantly improve your chances.\nIt comes down to formatting your resume correctively and optimizing it with relevant keywords and skills.\nTeal's AI-powered resume builder makes this easy to create a resume tailored to each job description.

But there's a lot of misleading information and conflicting advice about resume organization. \nIn this guide, you'll find research-backed methods for how to make a resume the right way. The tips and tools below will walk you through the process step-by-step, including nuances like how to prepare, the best way to build your experience section, and the important role of relevance across every section. \n‍\nNeed to make a resume? Use the AI Resume Builder to create one that aligns with every unique job.\n‍\n‍\nHow to make a resume\nWhether you're creating your resume from square one or working on updating an outdated document, streamlining this process all comes down to your execution. \n‍\nBelow, you'll learn the right way to:\nPrepare yourself for making a resume\nSelect the best resume format\nPresent your contact information\nCreate your resume title\nWrite your professional resume summary\nBuild your work experience \nFocus on your education and certifications\nInclude specific skills\nIncorporate other optional details such as projects, awards, volunteer work, and more.\nUpdate your resume\nCompliment your resume with a cover letter\nBefore you get started, one guideline to remember is that the job of your resume is to showcase the top 10% of your skills and experience that are 100% relevant to the role you're applying for. Every section outlined below will focus on how to write a resume for a job in a way that aligns with this principle\nLet's get started! \n‍\nStep #1: Prepare yourself for making a resume\nBefore diving into the details of resume writing, getting your proverbial ducks in a row is crucial.\nUnderstanding how to prepare a resume can streamline the entire process, making it smoother (and faster!). \n‍\nHere are five things to do before you start writing a resume :\nGather your career details: Make sure you have current and accurate company information, employment start and end dates, job titles, and your tangible achievements and skills. Take note of schools attended, degrees earned, and all certifications. If you're a recent graduate, include courses studied, relevant accolades, your GPA, or outstanding projects. Make a list of up-to-date, relevant online profiles, including LinkedIn, personal websites, or portfolio links.‍\nOrganize  your information: Create dedicated folders for each resume section, e.g., Certifications, Work Experience, Education, etc. (If you have hard-copy credentials like certificates, organize them in a file for easy access.)‍\nAdopt the right mindset: Revisit your past roles, not just for the details but to understand the value you brought. This will help you position each experience as you add them to your resume.‍\nSeek inspiration: Look at resume examples from your industry. Understand trends and take note of compelling ways to present similar information.‍\nSet the stage for tools: If you're considering intuitive tools like our resume maker, familiarize yourself with what it can do. Know what information it needs and how it can best showcase your experience. \n‍\nStep #2: Select the right resume format\nThe layout of your resume serves as its foundation, with the format playing a critical role in shaping the presentation of your credentials.\nThe best resume formats ensure you highlight your qualifications in a way that grabs attention and matches the expectations of hiring professionals. Here are a few considerations:\n‍\nThe most widely recognized format is the reverse chronological resume. It presents your work experience in a clear, linear progression, making it easier for hiring managers to trace its course. This format is straightforward, clear, and direct.\nIf you're just starting out, pivoting careers, or working in an industry where tools and software reign supreme, a hybrid resume might be more appropriate. This format starts with a professional summary, followed by a Skills section that immediately spotlights hard skills.\nA functional resume format focuses on hard skills and soft skills rather than your career history. This format should be used sparingly as it can be hard for hiring managers to follow your actual career progression.\nIn choosing the perfect format, consider where you are in your career, the nature of the roles you're applying for, and which design best conveys your strengths and achievements.‍\nGet your resume design right\nYour resume presentation goes beyond the content—it's also about how you frame that content. \nThe look, feel, and overall aesthetics shape a first impression. A glance can determine if your resume gets the attention it deserves in seconds.\nAs you start to create your resume, you need to consider the design.\nIf you're using a robust, intuitive tool like the Resume Builder, a lot of these design elements are considered for you—offering some customization after you've input your experience and other key details. But, if you're building a resume on your own, below are some best practices you need to be aware of upfront.\n‍\nBest practices for creating a professional resume format in 2024\nResume templates\nOpt for a simple resume template that's clean and modern.\nApplicant Tracking Systems (ATS) cannot scan an overly designed resume template with images or heavy graphics. \nIn case you don't know, the ATS is a digital filing system hiring professionals use to organize the application process. They can also search these systems for specific skills and keywords—but more on that later. \nBecause resumes scan into these systems, choose a modern resume template that can be easily scanned without formatting issues.\nPro Tip: Explore this collection of the best resume templates—a carefully curated selection that balances professional design and ATS-compatibility.\n‍\nResume structure\nYour resume should have a logical flow—starting with your header and contact details, followed by a professional summary, then detailing experience, education, and other relevant information. \n‍\nResume length\nHow long a resume should be depends on your career span and depth of experience. \nNew graduates or those in the first ten years of their career might be best off with a one-page resume, while seasoned professionals may require up to two pages. \nThe key is to prioritize relevance and clarity over length.\n‍\nResume header and headings\nYour resume header should prominently feature your name, making it the focal point. Essential contact details are directly below. Remember to keep it minimalistic, avoiding decorative elements.\nYour resume headings should be used to identify each section. They stand out from the rest of your resume in bold and with slightly larger text than the rest of your content. \n‍\nResume aesthetics\nMargins: Consistent resume margins give structure to your resume. Typically, one-inch to one-half-inch margins on all sides is best practice.\nWhite space: Use enough white space to break up your text to improve readability and prevent the document from feeling cluttered.\nBullets: Use resume bullet points to break down information—especially in your work experience achievements.\nFonts: Stick to professional and legible resume fonts regardless of industry or field. Arial, Times New Roman, Poppins, and Calibri are timeless choices.\nColors: While using colors for your resume, keeping them subtle and legible is essential.\n‍\nStart making a resume with Teal's Resume Builder\nBefore you start making a resume (or updating an outdated version), you need the right tools.\nTeal can be a game-changer, offering one platform to create, write, update, and analyze your resume. And you can jumpstart the entire process by uploading your LinkedIn profile or outdated resume to get a head start.\nWith Teal, managing your career history becomes organized, functional, and straightforward, simplifying your resume writing, one step at a time.\n\n\n‍\nStep #3: Add your contact information\nBefore a prospective employer can reach you, they need to know how. Writing your resume contact information correctly is the gateway to potential opportunities. It should be prominently and correctly displayed.\n‍\nYour name and contact information should include:\nFull Name\nPhone Number\nLocation\nProfessional email address\nLinkedIn profile URL \nPortfolio or personal website URL (if applicable)\n‍\nHow to make a resume contact information section:\nFull name as your resume header\nLocation | Phone number | Email address | LinkedIn URL | Portfolio or website URL\n‍\nWhat to Exclude:\nYour address: You no longer need your street address—just city and state.\nPersonal information: Social security number, marital status, age, or other private details.\nUnprofessional email addresses: It's time to reconsider addresses like sparkleponi8362768@email.com and opt for something more professional.\nIrrelevant social media accounts: For example, your personal Instagram with non-professional content.\n‍\nStep #4: Write your resume target title\nYour target title isn't about communicating where you've been but showcasing where you're headed. You should tailor it to every role you apply to, meaning it may vary across every resume you submit with a job application.\nPositioned prominently at the top of your resume, your resume title plays a strategic role in grabbing the attention of potential employers or recruiters—allowing you too craft the narrative for the rest of your resume. Your target title isn't about communicating where you've been but showcasing where you're headed. You should tailor it to every role you apply to. This means it may vary across every application.\nWhile adjusting your title to align with every job posting is a strategic play, the rest of your resume also needs to align. If you label yourself a \"data scientist,\" the experiences, skills, and achievements listed below should validate and support that claim.\n‍\nA target title is essential when considering what to write in a resume, as it helps you:\nTell your story\nMake strong first impressions\nAlign experience with job descriptions\nIn addition to the details above, if a company is using an ATS and hiring personnel searches for that specific title, they can easily find your resume because you've included that particular job title as a keyword.\n‍\nPro Tip: If you're looking for titles that align with the roles you've held in the past, try ChatGPT resume inquiries and see what insights materialize.\n‍\nStep #5: Write your resume summary\nYour resume summary, often called your professional summary or short professional bio, is a brief snapshot of who you are professionally. \nThink of it as an elevator pitch or your highlight reel, showcasing your career in aggregate—zeroing in on top achievements, skills, and qualifications in a concise way. \nHiring managers only have so much time to take a first pass at every resume. Because of this, your professional summary alone can make or break your chances of landing an interview. The overall objective? To generate enough interest to ensure they want to (and will!) keep reading.\n‍\nNow, let's get into how to build a resume summary.\n‍\nYour professional summary should:\nBe tailored to the job you're applying for using language and keywords from the job description to highlight your relevant skills, impact, and qualifications. \n\nFor example, let's say you're a project manager, and a job description mentions a tool like Airtable; you could say something like, \"Successfully managed and tracked over 50 projects in Airtable with a 95% on-time completion rate.\"\nIncorporate a time-based statement like \"Growth Marketing Manager with 7 years of experience...\" \nInclude at least two relevant skills and how you used those skills to have an impact.\n\nFor example, \"I created intuitive interfaces that increased user engagement by 25% and reduced bounce rates by 50%.\"\n‍\nBelow are 5 best practices to help you get started writing your summary.\nKeep your summary brief; between 3-5 sentences is ideal.\nAlways use the first-person voice.\nUse action verbs that demonstrate motion. For example, words like \"generated\" and \"achieved.\"\nAvoid using generic buzzwords or clichés. Instead, focus on specifics that distinguish your relevant experience.\nAlign your summary with the rest of your resume. The skills and qualifications should speak to what the reader will find in the rest of your content.\n‍\nWriting a professional summary with no experience\nUnlike mid-level job seekers, if you're new to your career or are pivoting roles or industries, writing a professional summary without relevant work experience can feel daunting. But remember, you have plenty of other applicable life experience outside of a traditional job that can speak to your abilities. \n‍\nConsider incorporating:\nCoursework where you gained tangible skills\nProjects you completed as part of your education or previous role and the outcome\nRelevant volunteer experience—highlighting the right skills\nLeadership roles that can attest to skills like teamwork, management, or organization\nProfessional certifications that align with your career path\nSoftware or tools you're familiar with\n‍\nPro Tip: Remember you should always be tying these elements back to the requirements of the job description. Check out these resume summary examples for inspiration across roles and industries.\n‍\nWriting a resume summary with Teal\nSumming up your experience, skills, and impact in just a few lines can be hard, let alone striking the right balance between confidence and humility. (And sometimes, just getting started is half the battle.) \nWith the Teal Resume Summary Generator you can use artificial intelligence to create the foundation for a summary that grabs attention, aligns with the role you're applying for, and makes hiring professionals want to dig deeper. \n\n‍\nWriting a resume objective\nIf you're trying to decide between a resume objective and a professional summary, you should know a few things before you start. \nA resume objective is similar to a professional summary with one major difference: a resume objective also includes career goals, aspirations, and what you want to achieve in the role you're applying for. \nModern resume practices indicate an objective can be perceived as outdated or even generic—especially when they aren't tailored effectively to a specific job. So, if you're deciding between a resume summary or objective unless you feel you have absolutely no relevant experience to include (you do!), steer clear of a resume objective and write a professional summary instead. \n‍\nStep #6: Build your resume work experience\nAfter your professional summary, it's time to build out your work experience. Your resume work experience bridges the bridge between your professional history and the role you're applying for. \nArguably, the most important section of your resume, Work Experience, emphasizes your career's depth, relevance, and impact.\n‍\nBest practices for how to set up a resume Work Experience section\nLet's get into some best practices for how to put together a resume Work Experience section. \n‍\nRelevance\nFirst, remember every position and achievement you highlight in your work experience section should be relevant to the role you're applying for. And if possible, each of these should also include skills and numbers, data, or metrics.\nFor example, let's say you're a special education teacher; you might be qualified to apply for a position as an on-site director of specialized services or as a remote curriculum developer. \nWhile your classroom management skills, with a 50% reduction in behavioral incidents, are valuable in the director position, they might not be as relevant when applying for the remote curriculum development job.\n‍\nConsistency \nNext, remember consistency is key when making a resume Work Experience section. Formatted in reverse chronological order, with your most recent position at the top, every relevant role should showcase the same information:\nCompany name\nJob title\nLocation\nDates of employment\n3-5 work bullet point achievements per role\n‍\nFormat\nFinally, the heart of your experience is your achievements. But you aren't alone if you're wondering what to write in a resume achievement. \nThe best way to write each achievement is using the following formula (or something similar).  \nSuccess Verb + Noun + Metric + [Strategy Optional] + Outcome = 1 bulleted achievement \n‍\nExamples of how to write a simple resume work experience \nStrategic initiatives\nAchieved sales growth by 35% by implementing a new digital marketing campaign, increasing annual revenue by $500,000.\nProject success\nLed the Green Energy Initiative project and delivered it 2 months ahead of schedule, which reduced client's carbon footprint by 20%.\nProcess improvements\nDesigned and implemented a new inventory management system that reduced product waste by 15%—saving the company $200,000 annually.\n‍\nHow to create a resume Work Experience section with Teal\nIn one click, the AI within the Teal Resume Builder can help you create a resume Work Experience section without the frustration of staring at a blank screen or toggling between platforms. \nStarting with Teal gives you a solid foundation to work from with tailored, metric-focused accomplishments to maximize the impact of your experiences in a streamlined, efficient, and professional way.\nMake resume writing seamless, one achievement at a time.\n‍\nHow to write a resume for a job\nLearning how to make a resume for a job is one of the most important skills you can have as a professional. Tailoring your content for a job, resume customization is key to making your application stand out.\nThink of the work experience you're creating now as the foundation; then, when you apply to different roles, you'll tailor your resume accomplishments to each specific role. Let's look at an example.\nSuppose you previously worked as a marketing manager and are applying for a role in content strategy. In that case, you'd highlight your experience creating content calendars, overseeing the creation, and analyzing engagement metrics rather than focusing on broader marketing initiatives that may not be as relevant. \n‍\nWhile you might have a diverse range of achievements and work experience, creating a targeted resume is crucial to emphasize the parts of your career most applicable to the role at hand—especially if it's your dream job. This makes it clear to the hiring manager that you have the specific skills they're looking for.\n‍\nPro Tip: Remember the ATS? The best way to get found by hiring professionals within that system is to be qualified for the jobs you apply to and demonstrate that qualification by aligning your skills and qualifications using precise keywords and language from the job description. \n‍\nStep #7: Create a resume Education Section\nLearning how to create a resume Education section is pretty straightforward. \nSitting just below your work experience, this section highlights your academic background and shows prospective employers you have the foundational knowledge or specialized training needed for the position.\nYour resume Education section should start with your highest level of education first, then move backward, listing each subsequent degree or educational qualification. \nInclude the degree earned, the institution's name, and the graduation or completion date. If you're still pursuing a degree, \"In Progress\" or \"Expected Graduation Date: [Month, Year]\" gives clarity on your current status. \n‍\nIf you're a recent grad looking to provide a more dynamic picture of your skills and background, consider  including:\nYour GPA (if it's above 3.0)\nRelevant honors\nRelevant coursework\nProjects\nAcademic achievements\n\nYou can structure this like a Work Experience section with 3-5 bullets highlighting the top skills and their subsequent impact.\nUltimately, if you're offering an in-depth look at your academic experience because you have limited professional experience, the goal is to present these details in a clear and organized way that aligns with the position you're seeking.\nAs a note, because your resume should only be 1-2 pages, if you find yourself with a limited resume real estate, only including your highest level of education is acceptable. \n‍\nStep #8: Include a dedicated spot for certifications\nHow do you make a resume that includes your certifications? With a dedication section that highlights the details of these specific achievements in one concise, well-structured, consistent format.\nCertifications on a resume highlight your qualifications, offering insight into your dedication, discipline, and commitment to professional development.\n‍\nTo incorporate them into your resume, include:\nThe name of the certification, any common acronyms or abbreviations it may be known by (such as PMP or CPA)\nThe certifying agency using the full business, institution, or organization name\nThe start date and date of completion using the same date format for each\nAnd while, in some professions, certifications are more of a \"nice to have,\" certifications are part of the foundation for many careers.\n‍\nHow to write a resume Education section\nSitting below your Education section, Certifications should look something like this:\nCertifications\nCertified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) | Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)\nJune 2023\nAWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional | Amazon Web Services\nOctober 2022\n‍\nStep #9: Add your relevant skills\nIf you made it this far, you already know that your skills should be incorporated throughout the other sections of your resume, like in your professional summary and work experience. So where does the concept of a resume Skills section fit in? \nAfter Certifications (or Education if you don't have any relevant certificates) comes Skills. Think of this section as a snapshot of your overall strengths, allowing hiring managers to assess your fit for the role without reading your entire resume in detail. \n‍\nBut there's a caveat. \nWhile resume soft skills are, of course, part of your skillset, this section actually isn't the best place for them. Soft skills (transferable skills like communication, collaboration, organization, and time management) are difficult to measure objectively. Without showcasing how you used those things for impact, they're just words on paper. It doesn't mean you can't include them; just keep in mind they have very little merit without context\nResume hard skills, on the other hand, are tangible assets.

And remember, as long as they're relevant to the role you're applying for,  just because you weren't paid doesn't make the skills you picked any less valuable.\nDepending on the additional sections you've incorporated, Volunteering and Leadership will come after Skills and possibly below Projects.\n‍\nHere's how to put together a resume Volunteering and Leadership section. \n\n‍\nPublications\nUnderstanding how to make your resume stand out also means thinking outside the box from time to time. Adding publications to your resume showcases expertise. And whether you were the subject of an interview or the published author, if the content of your publication is relevant to the role you're applying for, adding it to your resume will ultimately boost your credibility. \n‍\nBelow is the correct format for listing a publication on your resume.\nPublication name\nPublisher\nDate \n‍\nInterests\nFinally, the last optional section of your resume are your hobbies and interests. \nAdding hobbies and interests on a resume can strategically showcase your character. But including activities you enjoy outside of your professional journey needs a specific approach: Only add them if they're relevant to the role you're applying for.\nWhatever you do, keep this section brief and relevant. List the hobbies that correlate to the job (you can also categorize them like you may have your Skills section), and that's it! \n‍\n2024 resume tips\nWhew! That was a lot, but you're almost done! Below are some tips and resume best practices for strengthening your content to ensure it's concise, compelling, and credible. \n‍\nDouble-check resume format consistency\nEnsure you used consistent font size, uniform bullets, date and location formats, and style throughout.\nEliminate any redundancy\nIf you've repeated any information, skills, or achievements. Consolidate similar points.\nTweak the language\nUse active rather than passive voice. Also, replace overused words (e.g., \"helped\" or \"used\") with more dynamic action verbs (e.g., \"collaborated\" or \"utilized\"). (Check out these resume synonyms for inspiration.) \nCheck for grammatical and spelling errors\nProofread your resume with a tool like the Resume Checker with built-in spelling and grammar review. \n‍\n\n‍\nTrim and tighten\nIf your resume is longer than two pages, make it more concise. Aim for one to two pages if you have less than 10 years of experience.\n‍\nHow to make a resume examples\nBelow are a few of the best examples showing how to make a resume to help you get started building your resume.\n‍\nExample of how to create a resume for entry-level experience\nThis example highlights essential hard skills and showcases relevant work experience for entry-level candidates.\n\n‍\n‍\nHow to make a resume for a mid-level professional\nThis mid-level professional resume stays within a one-page format while emphasizing relevant experience.\n\n‍\n‍\nExample of how to write a resume for a senior-level professional\nThis example of how to write a resume for a senior-level professional remains concise at one page—even for a senior-level professional—demonstrating advanced experience and qualifications.\n\n‍\nExample of how to write a resume for executive-level experience\nThis executive-level resume spans two pages, covering extensive experience and leadership roles.\n\n‍\nStep #13: Add a cover letter\nA cover letter is more than just an attachment; it's a powerful tool to emphasize your qualifications and make a strong impression.\nThe best cover letter examples are tailored specifically to the desired job, making applications stand out. Here's how to get started:\n‍\nConduct research: Deep dive into the company's culture and the role you're applying for.\nAlways personalize: Address the hiring manager by name if you can. Avoid generic greetings if possible.\nHighlight relevant experiences: Dig into the most relevant experiences and skills that align with the position you're applying for.\nInclude a strong call to action (CTA): End your letter by expressing your eagerness to schedule an interview or conversation. A CTA makes the hiring manager's next steps crystal clear and easy.\n‍\nHow to create a great resume: takeaways and tools\nCreating a great resume is all about showcasing your unique story in a way that captures your qualifications and skills clearly, concisely, and consistently.\nRemember, it's not just about ticking boxes; it's about keeping your content relevant to the job you're applying for, ensuring consistency in resume format and tone, and judiciously choosing the right sections and achievements that best mirror your experience and how it aligns with each job you apply for. \nThe Teal Resume Builder is a dynamic tool that will help you create a resume with precision.

Adding publications on a resume can boost your credibility and authority. Plus, it may help you stand out. \nYou can add a publications section to your current resume template or use resume builders to help you list and format each piece. Teal is one of the best resume builders for listing publications. \nIf you’re applying for a job where your writing isn’t relevant, you can simply uncheck that section to exclude it. That makes it easy to have various resume versions for different roles. \nThis guide walks you through best practices when including publications on a resume. \nNeed to include publications on your resume? Create a free resume with Teal and easily list and format all the right details.\n‍\nWhat are publications on a resume?\nPublications on a resume include written and scholarly works published in reputable journals, websites, or other distinguished platforms. Blog posts on sites like WordPress, Medium, or Substack do not often qualify for the publications section of a resume and should often not be linked on your resume.\nExamples of publications worthy of a resume include:\nBook title, if you’re an author, researcher, or academic\nPeer-reviewed journal articles or papers, if you’re a professor, researcher, or in academia\nResearch papers, if you’re in law, science, medicine, etc. \nArticle title, if you’ve written articles for a well-known journal, website, or magazine (e.g. Journal of the American Medical Association, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, National Geographic, TIME)\nConference papers, if you’re a researcher or academic \nThe publications and presentations on your resume should be related to the industry you’re in and the open position in question.\n‍\nShould you include publications on your resume?\nYou may have an impressive list of publications. But now that you’re on the job search, you’re not sure about adding publications on a resume. \nTo help you decide, ask yourself: Is this related to the job? Could it help me land a job interview? If so, your potential employers want to see them. \n‍\nIf the answer is no, skip it. Bryan Berthot, a project manager, scrum master, and Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) candidate at Univ. of South Florida shares his strategy. \n“My practice is to add publications when they’re germane to the job in question and when they maximize the chance that my resume will be noticed. I walk the line between academia and industry, as I’m both a project manager practitioner and an adjunct faculty member who teaches.”\nThat means including published works for academic positions and leaving them off other positions. \n“Even though most adjunct faculty positions involve teaching and not research, for those jobs I always send my entire CV, which includes my academic publications. It sets me apart from many instructional faculty because by including my publications, it demonstrates that I can bring aspects of research into the classroom to give students real-world examples.\"\nFinally, Berthot shared examples of when not to include publications on your resume.\n\"For project manager jobs, I typically omit my academic publications and books from my resume—unless I suspect that it will set me apart from other candidates.”\n‍\nSometimes, the answer is obvious. If you match one of the following descriptions, it makes sense to add research publications on your resume.\nAuthor. If you’ve published a book, it establishes your credibility in a certain field. If you’re applying for a professorship or a writing-heavy role, include the book title. \nResearcher. If you’ve published your research and are applying for an academic position, research-based role, or as a speaker for a conference, it makes sense to include your research paper on your resume. \nStudent. If you’re a full-time student, research and writing might be your full-time job right now. In lieu of current working experience, listing publications on a resume can show your areas of expertise and highlight your writing skills.\nProfessor. Getting published is an important step on your journey to becoming a professor. If you’re applying for a teaching or research role, include all of your publications on your resume. \nTeal’s Resume Builder can help you add your publications to your resume easily. You can see resume templates and get guidance on what to include based on the job description. \nUse a Resume Template\n‍\n‍\nHow to list publications on your resume\nIf you’ve determined your published works are relevant to the job you’re applying for, you can add them to your resume. \nHere’s how to list publications on your resume:\nAdd a Publications section. You should create a dedicated resume section to list publications. In most cases, your Publications section will follow your Education section. \nList each publication in a bullet point. Include the publication title, the name of the publisher, and the date (month and year).\nChoose a style. Depending on your field, there might be a specific citation style you should use. Some examples include MLA format, APA style, AMA style, or IEEE style. \nStart with your most recent publications. List your publications on your resume in reverse chronological order. That means starting with your most recent publication and listing your older work in descending order.\n Refine your list. If you’re including a co-authored piece, make that clear and list out your role in the piece, such as “Lead author.” You can also include pending pieces by including the article title and noting it’s “Under review” or “Submitted for publication.” If any publications aren’t relevant to the job, delete them from the list.\nCreate Your Best Resume\n‍\n‍\nWhile there are nuances to every field and industry, these are best practices for how to show publications on your resume. Consult peers in your field and the job description instructions to properly format publications on your resume.\n‍\nHow to list scientific publications on resume\nIf you’re in the sciences and have published papers, you’ll likely use American Psychological Association (APA) or the Council of Science Editors (CSE) style when citing your work. \nThere are also slight differentiations on how to cite the publication based on the type of work. For instance, listing a book is different from listing a journal on your resume. \nCSE also has different citation variations:\nCitation-sequence\nCitation-name\nname-year \nChoose a style and cite your work using the appropriate format. According to Boston University Libraries, the general format for citing a journal using CSE is:\nAuthor. Year (or Date). Title of article. Title of journal. Volume number and issue number. Page numbers. URL in angle brackets. Date accessed.\nThe key is to use the same style for each publication listed on your resume. Not only is this more visually appealing, it’s also easier to understand. \n‍\nHow to list academic publications on a resume\nAcademic publications typically use either MLA or APA style. MLA refers to the Modern Language Association and APA is the American Psychological Association. Which one you should use may depend on your field. MLA is generally used in the humanities while APA is generally used in the sciences. \nAccording to the Library of Congress, article citations using MLA style include:\nLast name, First name. Title. Title of the Website, Version or edition, Publisher. Day Month Year of publication, URL. Day Month Year of access.\nYou can use a tool like Citation Machine to easily cite journal articles in APA style. The basic APA journal citation formula is:\nLast Name, First Initial. Middle Initial. (The year it was published). Article title. Publisher title, Volume or Issue, page range.\n‍\nHow to list research publications on a resume\nMany research publications use MLA or APA style for citations. You can choose which style best fits and use the formula when putting publications on your resume. \nIf you’re a research assistant and don’t have publications to list quite yet, you can still add your skills to your resume. You can create a research section on your resume if you have a lot to add. If it’s only a couple of items, include it in your bullets section. \nFor example:\nConducted 100 interviews on the relationship between social media and mental health for study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology\nTeal’s Resume Builder can help you start so you can easily list and format publications on your resume.\n‍\nSample publications on a resume\nYou have a range of citation styles to choose from; some may be a better fit than others, depending on your industry. Here are some examples of how to cite publications on your resume using common citation styles:\n‍\nMLA format\nSmith, Peter. Stoicism in the Modern Era, Philosophy Guide. 6 May 2020, [website]. Accessed 25 April 2024. \n‍\nAPA style\nHernandez, J. F. 2023. Sugar and Depression. Today in Mental Health, Volume 3, pgs 5-10.\n‍\nGeneral format\nIf you’re looking for a general format, you can use Teal to add your publications on your resume.\nInside the Resume Builder, you can include a publications section.‍\nYou can then input the Publication, Publisher, and the Date. \n‍\n\n‍\nHit “Save”\nThen you’ll see it added to your resume. You can uncheck the boxes if you want to take them off any resume. \n‍\n‍\nYou can customize and add publications to your resume using Teal’s Resume Builder and have control of how it looks and when it’s used.\n‍\nInclude your publications on your resume \nIf your publications are related to your career and the job you’re applying for, include them. Doing so highlights your expertise and skills. \nYou worked hard to get your work published. You don’t want to risk losing that credibility due to poor resume formatting. \nThe good news is that figuring out how to put publications on your resume is simple with Teal’s Resume Builder.

You’re likely sharing your relevant experience and skills, and maybe even your degree and a professional resume summary. But what about memberships and professional affiliations?\nHow do you know what professional affiliations and memberships to add—and when and where should you include them on your resume? This guide covers why these additions are valuable, how to know when to add them, and how to format them on your resume.\nStruggling to land interviews? Try Teal’s free AI resume builder. \n‍\nUnderstanding memberships and professional affiliations\nMemberships and professional affiliations are connections to professional organizations related to the practice in a professional industry.\nMemberships and professional affiliations both indicate you’re connected to professional organizations.\nProfessional organizations include:\nIndustry-specific organizations: Professional associations focused on a particular field\nGeneralized professional organizations: Broader professional associations focused on a larger professional area\nCertifications: Certificates awarded by professional associations after completing training or passing an exam\nProfessional service organizations: Professional associations providing community service and networking opportunities\nSpecialized organizations: Groups centered on a specific niche within an industry\nUnions: Organizations representing workers’ interests, advocating for fair wages, benefits, and working conditions\nCharitable organizations: Non-profit groups dedicated to specific philanthropic causes\nCivic organizations: Groups focused on improving community life through volunteer work (Learn how to list volunteer experience on your resume.)\nBoard memberships: Serving on the governing body of an organization, whether it’s a for-profit company, a nonprofit, or a public institution, to help oversee the organization’s strategy, direction, and performance\nAcademic honor societies: Organizations that recognize individuals who excel in academics or leadership, usually at high schools or universities\nSpecific associations enhance a candidate's credibility and demonstrate their commitment to their industry.\nAdding either a membership or professional affiliation can increase your credibility on your resume by showing you’re dedicated to your industry. You’re demonstrating that you go above and beyond to network with like-minded professionals, contribute to advancements in your industry, and keep up with new skills and trends.\n“When I review resumes, I look for affiliations because they usually signal commitment and a network within a specific industry,” says Jon Morgan, CEO and editor-in-chief of Venture Smarter, a business consulting firm.\nAccording to Morgan, affiliations are how you can show your enthusiasm for an industry through community involvement.\n“They prove you’re not just sitting around; you’re really getting involved and keeping up with the latest trends and how things are done. This is super important in fields where knowing the right people and staying current is a big deal.”\n‍\nProfessional affiliations vs professional memberships meaning\nWhile memberships and professional affiliations both indicate you’re connected to one of these organizations, the terms differ slightly:\nAffiliation: a looser connection with an organization; you may serve on a committee, collaborate on projects, or attend conferences.\nMembership: being an official part of the organization, which may require paying a fee, contributing regularly, or adhering to certain codes of conduct. \nTypically, a membership indicates a more serious commitment to the professional organization than an affiliation.\n‍\n\n‍\nMembership and professional affiliation examples\nProfessional affiliation and memberships span a variety of career types, industries, and interests. Here are a few common professional affiliation examples by industry.\n‍\n28 professional affiliation examples for a resume\nFinance\nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)\nCertified Financial Planner Board of Standards (CFP Board)\nFinancial Analysts Federation (FAF)\nFinancial Planning Association (FPA)\nInstitute of Management Accountants (IMA)\nNational Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB)\n‍\nEducation\nNational Education Association (NEA)\nAmerican Association of University Professors (AAUP)\nThe education section of a resume can be used to showcase various credentials, certifications, and affiliations specific to the education industry.\n‍\nEngineering\nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)\nAssociation for Computing Machinery (ACM)\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)\nSociety of Automotive Engineers (SAE)\n‍\nHealthcare\nAmerican Medical Association (AMA)\nAmerican Nurses Association (ANA)\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA)\nAmerican Pharmaceutical Association (APhA)\nAmerican Hospital Association (AHA)\nNote: When writing a resume for healthcare professionals, it is crucial to accurately list specific associations and certifications. Designations like 'Registered Nurse' must be clearly stated on resumes, particularly when applying for roles that require specific licenses or degrees.\n‍\nLaw\nAmerican Bar Association (ABA)\nNational Bar Association (NBA)\nAmerican Health Lawyers Association (AHLA)\nNote: To legally practice law, it is essential to have the necessary educational credentials and bar admission. Law associations, such as the ABA, NBA, and AHLA, provide valuable networking opportunities and experiences that can enhance a professional resume for those planning to practice law.\n‍\nManagement\nAmerican Management Association (AMA)\nProject Management Institute (PMI)\nSociety for Human Resource Management (SHRM)\n‍\nMarketing and Sales\nAmerican Marketing Association (AMA)\nNational Association of Sales Professionals\nPublic Relations Society of America (PRSA)\n‍\nTechnology\nAmerican Chemical Society (ACS)\nAssociation of Computer Engineers and Technicians\n‍\nHow to list memberships and professional affiliations on a resume\nYou have a relevant membership or professional affiliation you’d like to include—or maybe more than one. Here’s how to list memberships on a resume.\n‍\n1. Make a list of all your relevant memberships and affiliations\nFirst, list all of your memberships and affiliations. This includes any organization you’ve worked with or been an official member of.\nThen, narrow down which one of these are relevant to the role. When you're looking at the job description, consider:\nDoes this membership or professional affiliation relate to the industry I want to work in?\nDoes this membership or professional affiliation demonstrate I have the right job skills?\nDoes this membership or professional affiliation demonstrate I have relevant portable skills?\nIf the answer is “yes” to any of the above questions, you should include the membership or professional affiliation on your resume.\n‍\n2. Put the affiliation in your professional summary\nYou have a couple options for where to put organizations on your resume: either in your professional summary or in a separate section. The professional resume summary is the best choice if you have one professional affiliation or membership.\nThe summary paragraph of a resume, typically structured as three to five sentences, should include relevant affiliations to demonstrate professional involvement and enhance the overall effectiveness of the summary.\nIn the professional summary, naturally work in the affiliation or membership by using a proven format.\nExample of how to list affiliations on a resume\n[Your Title] with [Number] years of experience, skilled in [Skill 1], [Skill 2], and [Skill 3]. Proven ability to [Achievement or Result]. Actively involved in [Professional Affiliation].\nOr, if more subtly:\n[Your Job Title] and [Organization Name] member with [Number] years of experience, skilled in [Skill 1], [Skill 2], and [Skill 3]. Proven ability to [Achievement or Result].\n‍\n3. Or, create a separate affiliations section\nSometimes, it’s OK to have sections beyond  “experience,” “education,” “skills,” or even “hobbies and interests.” If you have multiple affiliations, create a new section on your resume.\n\n‍\nChoose a title that most accurately reflects what’s underneath it; for example, if you’re listing two professional affiliations and one certification, you could use “Affiliations.\" Common titles for this section include:\nAffiliations\nProfessional Affiliations\nCertifications\nProfessional Development\nList all of the organizations’ names—including the acronym, if applicable—and the dates, in years, of your membership of affiliations.\nTeal’s Design Mode in Resume Builder can help add membership and affiliations without having to create a resume from scratch. In the “certifications” section, you can easily add professional affiliations and memberships with clear, customizable formatting:\n‍\n\n‍\nThis section should live below your experience section.\n‍\n\n‍\n4. Include any relevant roles or skills\nIf you’ve held a leadership role in the organization, be sure to list the title. You can also use bullet points to list skills you gained if they aren’t included in other sections of your resume. \nIf you’d like to add professional affiliations or memberships and add more details about them, you can use ​​Teal’s Design Mode in the resume maker and navigate to “Projects.”\nFor each professional affiliation, you can add the organization’s name, dates you were (or are) a part of it, and free-write any additional skills you built, projects you worked on, events you organized, or leadership positions you held. While you want to include key details, focus on keeping this section brief.\n\n‍\nOnce you’ve added more information about your memberships and affiliations, you can change the section title in Teal’s Design tab.\n\n‍\nAffiliations on a resume example\nNow that you know how to include memberships and affiliations on a resume, what should they look like? Here are a few examples.\n‍\nHow to list professional affiliations on a resume\nIn this example, this person has multiple professional affiliations and certifications, so they’ve created a separate section to list all of them in one centralized place. \n\n‍\nHow to list professional memberships on a resume\nIn this example, memberships are in the professional summary at the top of the resume. This saves resume space and gives extra credibility to your summary right off the bat.\n‍‍\n‍\nHow to list organizations on a resume\nIn this example, this job seeker has shared not only what professional organizations they’re affiliated with or a member of, but gives more detail about the roles they’ve played and skills they’ve learned. This legitimizes the affiliations section, helping it functionally act as an extension of their work experience.\n‍\n‍\nWhen to include memberships and professional affiliations on a resume\nWhile memberships and professional affiliations can be helpful additions to your resume, there’s a time and place to include them.\n“If you are in a technical role requiring specific expertise or a highly regulated field, such as education, finance, insurance, engineering, or computer science, listing a professional affiliation on your resume can strengthen the perception of your subject matter expertise and professional engagement,” says Phoebe Gavin, career and leadership coach.\nGavin emphasized that professional affiliations are especially useful for those in or seeking leadership roles:\n“You'll also benefit from including your affiliation if you hold a leadership position or are a frequent contributor to the professional association, such as having a board seat, being a member of the leadership team, or serving as an educator, coach, or mentor in the association's programs.”\nWhen else should you include memberships or professional affiliations on your resume?\nIf it’s required: Read the job posting closely to see if the role requires a specific membership or affiliation. This is common for fields like law or health care, but can apply to any industry. If the role mentions a membership or professional affiliation in “preferred qualifications” and you have one, that’s a good sign to include it on your resume, too.\nIf it’s relevant: If your professional affiliation or membership is in the same field you’re applying to, including it can show your industry expertise.\nTo show commitment: Including a membership or professional affiliation shows you’re taking action to dedicate yourself to the field, demonstrating commitment, a growth mindset, desire to connect with like-minded people, and a passion for life-long learning.\nTo demonstrate transferable skills: If you’re changing careers or entering a field you don’t have as much direct experience in, adding a professional affiliation or membership can show you have key skills and commitment to the role you’re looking for. \n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid when adding memberships and professional associations\nAdding a membership or professional affiliation to your resume is almost as easy as listing the organization’s name out and the year—but you should be more discerning when deciding which ones to include and how you list them.\nCommon resume mistakes when adding memberships and professional affiliations include:\nAdding irrelevant memberships or professional affiliations\nIncluding personal affiliations that don’t correspond to the role\nListing outdated affiliations of groups you’re no longer a part of\nNeglecting to include relevant leadership roles or positions \nOverusing or misspelling organization acronyms \nAccording to Morgan, relevance is key to knowing when to include affiliations on a resume:\n“If your affiliations are not well-known or relevant to the role, or if you’re in a field where such affiliations aren’t valued, they might not add much value and could clutter your resume.”\n‍\nHow to build relevant affiliations\nIf you’re looking to build professional affiliations or memberships to add to your resume, it’s never too late.\n‍\nDo your research\nFirst, figure out what professional affiliations or memberships might be most beneficial to you and your career. Don’t just think of your current job—think ahead to what might benefit you a year, five years, or even ten years down the line.\n“Start researching organizations relevant to your industry,” Morgan says. She gave specific tips on how best to go about this:\n“Check their membership requirements and benefits to ensure they match your professional needs. Going to industry events or talking to current members can also give you a good idea before you decide to join.”\n‍\nConsider the size of the association\nGavin recommends joining one niche association and one large association:\n“For my clients who are minorities, the valuable type of niche association focuses on the intersection of professional and identity.”\nNiche associations are smaller, but tend to have more engaged members. These create a sense of community, says Gavin: \n“There may be professional associations that convene people in your function or industry who share your identity markers, such as being a woman, a person of color, or a member of the LGBTQ community. These groups are often passionate about supporting each other professionally, and being active in them can be very beneficial.”\nWhile the smaller, engaged groups can provide direct support and community, Gavin still advises to look at larger associations, too—which may have more resources and recognition. \n“Don't ignore the larger, more general associations that host major conferences for your industry. They can also be incredibly valuable, but you might have to work a little bit harder to be noticed.”\n‍\nWork toward the requirements (if applicable)\nEvery professional organization is different. Some have no requirements and anyone can join. Others require years of experience or a certain score on an exam.\nOnce you’ve decided what organization you’re interested in, be sure you know exactly what you need to do to become a member. Then, start working toward it! Talk to other members to get tips on how they fulfilled their requirements and be sure to keep up with crucial deadlines and other organization rules.\n‍\nShow off your memberships and professional affiliations with Teal\nMemberships and professional affiliations are a great way to boost your resume’s credibility. Being a member of a professional organization—or affiliated with one—demonstrates your commitment to the industry, willingness to network with like-minded people, and passion for learning more. \nWhile professional affiliations and memberships are usually a positive addition to a resume, it’s crucial to add them in a relevant, concise, and error-free way. Using Teal’s Design Mode feature can help you add these resume elements stress-free to ensure they bring the most impact.

Try Teal’s ​​free AI resume builder.\n‍\nWhat are resume language skills?\nYour resume language skills describe your proficiency in different languages—both spoken and written, highlighting your language fluency. On your resume, you’ll list:\n1. The language\nExample: German‍\n2. Your level of language proficiency\nExample: Professional proficiency\nListing your knowledge of foreign languages on your resume calls attention to your ability to communicate in multiple languages, which can be helpful in roles where you’ll interact with diverse clients, coworkers, vendors, or business partners.\n‍\nHow to list languages on your resume\nWith that groundwork in place, here’s a closer look at the steps to follow to write language skills on your resume:\n‍\n1. Review the job description\nWhen you’re figuring out how to make a resume, tailoring your document to a specific job description is the most important thing. Return to the job posting to review it with a fine-tooth comb and ask:\nDoes the job description include language skills?\nIf so, does it mention specific languages?\nIs the employer looking for a specific level of language proficiency?\nIf you don’t want to scan the job description yourself, Teal’s Matching Mode will surface important keywords and qualifications directly from the job posting so you have a better idea of what to include on your resume.\n\n‍\nYour answers to the above questions will help you determine which languages to include and how to list them appropriately.\n‍\n2. Identify your relevant language skills\nAfter you review the job ad, determine which language abilities to include on your resume. With the job description as your guide, ask yourself:\nDo I speak and write the employer’s desired language(s)?\nDo I possess the desired proficiency level and language fluency?\n‍\n‍\nIf your answer to both of those questions is “yes,” then that language is worth listing on your resume.\nIf the job description says the employer is looking for bilingual employees or multilingual candidates but doesn’t mention a specific language, list all of your known languages and relevant proficiency levels to highlight your language skills.\n‍\n3. Choose the appropriate resume section\nNow for the big question: Where are you supposed to list languages on your resume? \nYou can include your languages in each of these resume sections:\n‍\nSkills section\nList your languages and proficiency level in your resume skills section along with your other hard skills and soft skills.\nIn the skill section of Teal’s Resume Builder, click to add a new skill. You can sort them in alphabetical order or turn off that toggle and click and drag your skills into the order you want them to appear.\n\n‍\nProfessional summary\nIf the employer specifically mentions being multilingual or a particular language, include your language skills in your resume summary so they’re featured prominently.\nIn Teal, click “Add Professional Summary” (or edit and existing one) to incorporate your language skills in your paragraph. Use the checkboxes to select which of your summaries to include on your resume.\n‍\n\n‍\nWork experience\nIf you used your language skills heavily in a previous job, include that information with your work experience bullet points to show how you’ve applied your language learning in a professional context.\nIn Teal’s Work Experience section, click “Add Achievement” or edit an existing bullet point to incorporate your language skills. You can also click the “Write with AI” button to automatically generate your bullet points with AI.\n‍\n\n‍\nDedicated language skills section\nIf you speak more than two languages, you can create a languages skills section that’s dedicated to your language abilities and proficiency levels.\nUse Skills Categories in Teal to create a category for languages and drag your language skills into that category so they’re grouped together on your resume.\n\n‍\n\n‍\nIf the employer takes the time to include language skills in the job posting, it’s also worth mentioning your language skills in your cover letter.\nAn easy way to do this is to match a full job title and description to your resume and Teal’s AI Cover Letter Generator will write a cover letter for you.\n‍\n\n‍\n4. Write your language and skill level\nOnce you’ve figured out all of the above, knowing how to write language skills on your resume is pretty straightforward. When including languages in your skills section (whether it’s your resume skills section or a dedicated language section), you’ll list your language and proficiency level like this:\n‍\n\n‍\nWhen listing languages in your professional summary or resume bullet points, you’ll need to provide a little more detail. You can see what that looks like in the examples included in the following section.\n‍\nResume language skills examples\nHere are examples of how to list language skills in the four different resume sections mentioned earlier:\nSkills section\nProfessional summary\nWork experience\nLanguage skills section\n‍\nResume language skills example: Skills section\n\n‍\nResume language skills example: Professional summary\n\n‍\nTIP: If you’re struggling to write your own professional summary, Teal's Resume Summary Generator will automatically write a summary for you within seconds.\n‍\nResume language skills example: Work experience section\n\n‍\nTIP: Teal’s Resume Bullet Point Generator will create impactful, metric-driven bullet points to highlight your biggest career achievements.\n‍\nResume language skills example: Language skill category\n\n‍\nYou can assign skill categories in Teal’s Resume Builder to group all of your skills by level, language, or any other category that makes sense.\nClick “Add a Category” to create a new skills grouping and then drag your skills to the appropriate spot.\n‍\n\n‍\nShould you include languages on your resume?\nHere’s the short answer: yes. If you speak or write languages outside of your native language, those are helpful to include on your resume.\nBenefits of including a foreign language (or languages) on your resume:\nCompetitive advantage: While speaking a second or third language might seem natural to you, it’s not a skill many candidates possess. Your language abilities can help you stand out from other applicants.\nCultural awareness: Particularly with more remote and hybrid work arrangements, work environments are becoming increasingly diverse. Comprehension of different languages demonstrates an understanding and appreciation of different cultures.\nHigher salary: 40% of multilingual employees say their language skills not only helped them land their jobs, but that they also led to earning 19% more than single-language speakers.\n‍\nWhich languages should you include on your resume?\nThere’s a lot to gain when you include language skills on your resume. But that doesn’t mean you should include Spanish or French just because you took a year of each in High School. At this point, those basic language courses won’t do much to benefit your career.\nHow to determine which languages to include on your resume:\nWhat is your language skill level? Including a foreign language on your resume indicates to the employer that you have current working proficiency with that language—meaning they’ll expect you can at least engage in basic written or verbal conversations. Only include a language if your skill level is proficient. You don’t need to be fluent, but you do need to be able to communicate at a basic level.\nHow relevant are language skills to the job? Is speaking a second language pertinent to that position? Or does the position not require much foreign language use, communication with diverse groups, or people skills in general? Think about how pertinent your language skills are to the role.\nDoes the job ask for specific languages? Similarly, take a close look at the job description (or use Teal to automate this for you) to see if the posting mentions several languages, desired foreign language levels, or specific languages the employer is looking for. If you possess what the company is specifically asking for, you can list language skills accordingly.\nOne more important thing to remember: You do not need to list the language your resume is written in, as your resume itself indicates you are fluent in that language. For example, if your resume is written in English, you don’t need to list English in your language skills section.\n‍\nUnderstanding language proficiency levels\nNoting your level of language proficiency on your resume helps employers understand how well you’re able to communicate in a specific language. But pinpointing your own level of proficiency can feel murky. Fortunately, you can refer to a language proficiency scale to determine your skill level.\nMost popular language proficiency frameworks:\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR)\nAmerican Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL)\nInteragency Language Roundtable (ILR)\nCanadian Language Benchmarks (CLB)\nAnd while LinkedIn isn’t necessarily a formal language proficiency framework, it’s another common option people use when defining their language skills on their profiles. Here’s a quick comparison of the language proficiency levels in each of these scales:\n‍\n\n‍\nNot sure how to choose which language proficiency framework to use on your resume? Your safest bet is to choose one that uses words instead of numbers to describe your skill level. A hiring manager might not understand what “B2” means for your proficiency level, while “professional working proficiency” is unmistakable. \nThat said, if the job description mentions a specific proficiency level using one of the other scales, default to that scale to define your own language skills on a resume.\n‍\nHow to determine your language proficiency level\nThe above scales are helpful for understanding each language level—but it can still be hard to determine where your own skills fall on the spectrum. How can you tell if you have professional working proficiency or full professional proficiency? \nStrategies to define your proficiency with foreign languages:\nTake online assessments: Many of the proficiency scales also offer resources and assessments to help you. Check out the CEFR self-assessment grids or the ACTFL can-do statements to get a better idea of your skill level.\nReview detailed descriptions: The chart above was a quick overview of the different scales. Each one offers detailed descriptions of each proficiency level. Those are worth checking out to get a clearer idea of what’s required to satisfy each skill level.\nPractice with native speakers: You can also put yourself to the test by exchanging messages or engaging in a conversation with proficient or fluent speakers. That’ll give you a solid idea of how capable you are of applying your language skills in the “real world.”\nStruggling to keep your skills (or languages) straight on your resume? You can assign skill categories in Teal’s Resume Builder to group all of your skills by level, language, or any other category that makes sense.\n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid when listing languages on your resume\nYou’re ready to list language skills on your resume. As you do so, keep an eye out for these three common mistakes:\nSkipping proficiency level: It’s not enough to just list a language. Include your language level to let employers know your proficiency. Make sure to stick with a consistent scale too. It’s confusing to hiring managers when you describe your skill level as “Intermediate” with one language and “Limited Working Proficiency” with another.\nOverstating proficiency: Lies have no place on your resume—and that includes your language skills. Be honest about your proficiency with each foreign language.\nUsing design elements: While some resume writers might recommend using fancy graphics or charts to show your skill level, those design elements are difficult for resume parsers and applicant tracking systems (ATS) to process. Stick with simple text instead.\n‍\nUse Teal to highlight your language skills\nWhether you’re fluent or a conversational speaker, listing language skills on your resume is a great way to stand out from other job seekers—especially if the role requires using more than one language.\nTeal’s Resume Builder can help you clearly include language skills on your resume with:\nAI features to automatically generate your resume summary and your metric-driven achievements to include with your work history\nSkills categories to organize and list your hard skills, soft skills, and languages \nMatching Mode to compare your resume to the job description and identify other keywords (or languages) to include on your document\nReady to get started?

Either way, it’s common to have some contract work experience. The question is, should you add contract work to a resume?\nContract work is legitimate experience, so don’t forgo it on your resume. Just make sure you’re listing it correctly. In this article, you’ll learn how to put contract work on your resume in a way that emphasizes your flexibility, adaptability, professional skills, and achievements.\n‍\n‍\nReady to showcase your contract work experience? Build a resume that highlights your flexibility and achievements with Teal's AI Resume Builder.\n‍\nWhat is contract work?\nContract work is short-term employment. These jobs have a defined work period. They may also have a defined end goal or set of duties to be performed. \nCompanies hire contractors as outside employees. Contractors are paid based on a negotiated rate for the project or per hour. \nWhen you do contract work, you may have been called an independent contractor, a freelancer, or 1099 employee. \n‍\nContract worker vs full-time employee\nA full-time employee (FTE) works 40 hours per week for one employer, receives their benefits from the employer, and typically goes to the employer’s office. They can expect raises, promotions, and up-skilling from the same job. \nA contract worker works their own set of hours for one or multiple employers, depending on the contract type. They may work at an office or from home. They will typically build a work portfolio in order to uplevel their job title or pay grade. \nBecause contractors are outside employees, these differences may apply:\nDo not typically earn company benefits\nHave to manage their own taxes\nMay have to purchase their own equipment \nHave flexible or set hours \n‍\nTypes of contract work\nFixed-term contract\nA contract made for a specified period of time. This contract has a start date and end date. As an independent contractor, you may receive some benefits similar to those of an employee during the duration of the contract period, but not all.  \nFor example, you may be hired to work 40 hours a week as a technical writer to help the IT team at a large company complete a project for a six-month period. \nThese contracts may also be called “contract-to-hire” contracts. This means you start as a contract employee with the idea that the company may, depending on performance, hire you as a full-time employee once your original contract ends. \n‍\nFreelance contract\nA contract made for a specified project. This contract should outline hours, project details, deliverables, salary, payment terms, etc. \nFor example, you may be hired by an IT company to help their in-house team complete the code for a new application. You work for them until the application is complete.\nIf you work in this way, you are considered self-employed. This means it is your responsibility to pay your own NICs and tax contributions. \n‍\nAgency workers and temporary staff\nA potential employer can hire temporary employees from an agency. As an agency worker, your contract and benefits are agreed upon and managed by the agency. \n‍\nPros and cons of contract work\nFreelancers and independent contractors are not entitled to the same rights as FTEs. For example, FTEs are entitled to:\nReceiving the national minimum wage\nMinimum level of paid holiday or maternity pay\nMinimum length of rest breaks\nProtection against unlawful discrimination\nMaternity or paternity pay\nAs a trade-off, freelancers and contractors enjoy more flexibility over their pay and schedule. This may look like:\nHigher hourly rate \nFlexible schedule \nOpportunity to try new things \n‍\nWhy list contract work on your resume?\nWhether you had just one stint with a contract job or you’ve managed a few contract roles under an agency, it’s important to show off this experience. Potential employers don’t look at it as inferior to permanent employment; in fact, it can be seen as a good thing for your career. Here’s why:\nShowcases diverse experience: You learn a lot about various industries when moving from contract to contract which proves you're a versatile worker.\nDemonstrates adaptability: Because contract workers don’t get the same onboarding as FTEs, you must adapt to various industries and environments quickly, which shows you’re a fast learner. \nHighlights specific skills or expertise: Because many contracts are project-based, they help you highlight specific achievement-based bullets, which may be more appealing to hiring managers.\nShows initiative and ownership: You have to manage much of your own time and job progress when working on a contract basis, which shows you are self-motivated.\n‍\nHow to list contract work on your resume\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to list contract work on a resume.\nFirst, decide on a listing method. The below examples are just that—examples, but you can choose a listing method based on the clearest way to arrange all your experience. \nThe essential details to include are the company you worked for, the position you had in each contract, and the duration of each contract.\n‍\nAs a FTE at a staffing agency or consultancy\nIf you worked for an agency that sent you multiple clients or contracts, you can group them together under the agency. This order will look similar to a traditional FTE role and is easy for recruiters to read.\nList an employer. This can be the staffing agency.\nOptionally, add a blurb to provide clarity on the nature of the work. \nList a job title. You may have a job title that was given to you or you may have to give yourself a standard job title.\nAdd \"contractor\" or \"consultant\" at the end of your title if necessary. \nList the dates of your contract.\nList your bullets.\nWrite Your Resume with AI\n‍\n\n‍\nAs a full-time self-employed contractor\nIf you took on a lot of contract and freelance work for a number of months or years, consider creating your own firm (if you haven’t done so already) and listing your experience under that heading. This self-employment resume allows a large number of jobs to go underneath a single heading.\nGive your company a name such as [First Name] [Last Name] Consultancy.\nAdd a short blurb describing the nature of your duties as a full-time contractor.\nList a job title per contract work or add the client name per contract.\nUnder each contract or client, list the dates.\nList your bullets.\n‍\nAs a single contract position\nIf you’ve held a single contract position from a company while in between full-time jobs, placing this experience on your resume is easy. List the job as you would any other, but label the job title clearly with a modifier such as: \nTemporary \nTemp\nContract\n‍\nTips on how to highlight contract work achievements\nIf you had a lot of short-term contract work (six months or under), the hiring manager may worry you haven’t seen many projects from start to finish. Combat that worry by listing achievement-based bullet points. Here are some quick tips on how to highlight achievements in your bullets:\nUse active verbs (e.g., Developed, Implemented, Managed, Designed, Optimized)\nAdd numbers to illustrate a point (e.g., Cut expenses by 10% within a fiscal year)\nDiscuss completed projects or accomplishments (e.g., Secured five major partnerships for a media campaign). \nIf you’ve written a lot during your contract work, consider learning how to add publications to your resume.\nAdd a portfolio to your LinkedIn profile and include the link on your resume\n‍\n‍\nFor more tips on how to highlight achievements in bullet points, check out this guide on how to write achievements in your resume. \n‍\nHow to format a contract job title on your resume\nSince contract work often means multiple job titles under one employer, you may wonder how to list contract work. Traditionally, the resume is formatted by the employer, with the date range indented to the right of the resume. Since you may need to list multiple jobs under one employer, you can opt to list date ranges next to the job titles as well.\nIn Teal’s AI Resume Builder, formatting a resume’s date range doesn’t have to be a hassle. Teal’s Design Mode simplifies the process of properly listing work experience.\nToggle between showing dates based on company, based on position, or both. \nCreate Your Best Resume for Free\n‍\n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid when listing contract work on your resume\nThe key to a clean, enticing resume is the formatting. Focus on lumping your work together under certain employers or job titles so that a recruiter can easily see what you do within a matter of seconds. \nHere are the biggest mistakes in listing contract work:\nNot being consistent: Use the same format throughout your resume. If you call your contract work “temp” or “contract,\" use that same terminology throughout. \nIncluding irrelevant information: You don’t need to include all your contract work. Tailor your resume to the job. \nHaving resume gaps: Having a gap on your resume can hurt your chances of getting an interview, so utilize contract work to your advantage. Include any freelance work on your resume to help fill up a gap in your employment history. \n‍\nContract work matters \nContract work is a great way to fill gaps on your resume, try out new work duties, enjoy a flexible schedule, and more. Although, it does veer away from the most traditional form of full-time employment. That’s why formatting the resume in a way that highlights how much you’ve contributed while under contracts is the key to capturing hiring managers’ attention. \nTeal's Resume Builder can simplify the process for you. Add your various contract experience in a matter of seconds, utilize different methods for formatting your experience, and quickly tailor your own resume just for each job application–getting you closer to the role of your dreams.\nSign Up, It's Free\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do you put a few temporary or contract positions on a resume?\nDoes contract work look good on a resume?\nDoes contract work look bad on a resume?\nHow do you add that you are working for a new contract at the same job on your resume?\nHow do you mention a big name company on a resume when you were a contractor?","URL Slug":"list-contract-work-on-resume-guide-examples"}}]}

Beyond what you’d learn in a more traditional job, you’re also growing in areas like time management, taking initiative, and problem-solving.\n\nThe key is learning how to take this valuable work history and translate it onto self-employed resumes to increase your chances of landing a job.\n\nSound like a tall order? Here’s what you need to know about the best method of how to put self-employed work on your resume (with self-employed resume examples included).\n\nTeal's AI Resume Builder \nUse Teal to create and optimize your self-employed resume.\nIncluding self-employed on resumes: Why it matters\n\"Self-employed\" is a fairly broad term. At its most basic level, it means that you worked independently, for yourself (rather than, for example, working with one specific company). But the life of a self-employed professional can vary widely, looking like:\n\nFreelancing: With freelance work, your schedule is highly flexible, working with multiple clients (whom you choose) on short-term projects. \nSole proprietorship: Most freelancers are sole proprietors. In other cases, sole proprietors are considered business owners who can do things like hire employees.\nContract work: An independent contractor generally has a working relationship with a single client on longer, fixed-term projects.\nEntrepreneurship: Entrepreneurs make money by starting and building a business.\nPartnership: A partnership is the next step up from a sole proprietorship. It’s a business owned by two or more people.\nConsulting: Consultants are often independent contractors—people who offer expert advice to private companies. \nWhile these are all types of self-employed experiences, many of these terms carry some overlap. If you don’t know which one best describes your work and employment history, fall back on “self-employed.”\n\nShould you put self-employment on your resume?\nAbsolutely!\n\nIncluding career-focused experiences—such as freelance writing on the side, contract work between full-time jobs, or even opening a small business—can help prove your flexibility and resourcefulness. (But remember, listing every job title or experience you’ve ever had might not be relevant. Hiring managers probably don’t care about that lemonade stand you had in middle school.)\n\nOutside of more general job skills (like interpersonal skills), people who are self-employed also commonly specialize in a certain type of work. You can showcase any technical competencies or hard skills in the \"About Me\" section of your self-employed resume and beyond.\n\nPractical guide: Listing self-employment on your resume\nIn many ways, adding self-employed work to your resume will look the same as adding any other job or work experience on your resume. You’ll want to include:\n\nA job title (that clearly signals you were self-employed)\nA company name\nThe dates you started and ended each position or gig (dividing up certain freelance projects, for example)\nBullet points with compelling descriptions of what you did\nA well-written resume summary\nAdditional skills, certifications, or successes \nBut figuring out what to put for the company name when self-employed can be tricky. One option is to include a header that says “Freelance” or “Contract” and list multiple independent contracting clients as subheaders under that:\n\nFreelance Writer \nXYZ Company\nABC Company\nAnother is to name your job title and the client or company on the same line, with further description underneath:\n\nABC Company — Freelance Graphic Designer\nIf you have your own business, you can include your business name. Just make sure to denote that you’re an entrepreneur rather than an employee.\n\nFinally, if you don’t have much space to include your self-employed experience, it’s okay not to name any companies at all. Simply say “Consultant” or “Freelancer” with a couple of brief sentences about your self-employed work experience, mentioning specific personal projects where you achieved results:\n\nFreelance Developer: Helped five clients design and maintain websites, lowering bounce rate to 30% and increasing conversion rate to 3%. Worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.\nWrite your self-employed resume with Teal\nThe Teal AI Resume Builder offers one tool to create, optimize, and manage your resume. You can build one from scratch or upload an existing resume (or your LinkedIn profile!) to get started. Then, use Resume Analysis and Matching Mode to bridge any gaps between your self-employed experience and each unique role you apply for.\n\nCreate Your Resume For Free\n‍\n\nArticulating your self-employed role: Creating a compelling job description\nOnce you’ve figured out a good header, the next step is writing a self-employed job description for a resume that explains exactly what you did as your own boss. \n\nThis means adding relevant bullet points (with metrics, wherever possible); using strong action verbs (achieved, exceeded, generated); and staying honest about what you did or didn’t do\n\nBut as you list self-employment experiences on a resume, you’ll want to specifically highlight any self-employed skills you acquired or honed during those experiences that you might not have gotten during a traditional 9-5. For example, did you:\n\nImprove your time management and organizational skills by working on multiple new client projects at once?\nMarket yourself and your personal brand on social media to gain more clients?\nAdapt your work to fit the different guidelines of each company you worked with?\nThese are all great details that you should weave into a self-employed resume summary.\n\nShould you put your small business on your resume? Sure! If you’ve ever started your own small business, this is a great detail to include on your resume—this is something that not everyone has done. Describe yourself as business owner, CEO, or manager, whichever one feels most appropriate for you as a self-employed professional. If you have a company website, you can add it as a bullet point along with your contact details.\n\nSelf-employed resume examples\nFull-time self-employed sample resume\nLooking for a sample self-employed resume to impress a hiring manager?

Current students should always include an expected graduation date on their resumes.\nWhen you officially graduate, you’ll change your expected graduation date to your actual graduation date—the month and year you officially earned your diploma.\nBut while you’re still in school, including your planned graduation date (both month and year) on your resume helps employers in a few different ways:\nClarifies your career stage: It makes it clear that you’re still in school while also providing important information such as the university you’re attending, the type of degree you’re pursuing, and of course, when you plan to finish.\nImplies earliest start date: It helps employers understand when you’re available to start, which is especially important if you’re applying for your first full-time, entry level job out of college.\nGives insight into interview availability: It gives employers an idea of your level of flexibility for scheduling interviews and other next steps in the hiring process. Your class schedule and other educational commitments will need to be considered.\n‍\nHow to find your anticipated graduation date\nYou likely started school with a rough idea of how long the process would take. Most people understand it typically takes four years to get a bachelor degree.\nBut in reality, the actual amount of time it takes to finish a degree can vary greatly depending on several factors:\nAre you attending full time or part time? \nWere specific courses available when you needed them? \nDid you take a gap year or do a study abroad experience for a term?\n‍\nHow long does it take to graduate?\nAs one study from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center shows, while a bachelor’s degree takes 5.7 years on average, there are students who graduate “on time” in four years, and even more who complete their degree in closer to six years. For instance, students with an associate degree takes 8.2 years to graduate with a bachelor’s degree, on average.\nWhat type of institution plays a big part in determining anticipated graduation dates. For instance, those who graduate with a bachelors from a non-profit, four-year private college are likely to graduate in less time than those who attend public four-year colleges. However, those who earn a bachelor’s from a for-profit university are likely to take longer than both public and non-profit private institutions.\n‍\nHow to determine your expected graduation date\nWith such huge fluctuations, how can you correctly figure out when you’ll wrap up? Some simple math will give you your best estimate:\nLook at your registration or other degree resources to see how many credits are required for your degree. In general, associate’s degrees require 60 semester credits and bachelor’s degrees require 120 semester credits. But that can vary, so confirm the information for your specific degree and program of study.\nDetermine how many credits you’ve finished so far. You can request your transcript and see how many you’ve completed.\nDo some simple subtraction to see how many credits you have remaining. For example, if your degree requires 120 credits and you’ve completed 90, you have 30 credits left to graduate.\nPlot those remaining credits over the upcoming semesters. With 30 credits left, you can take 15 credits over the next two semesters and be done within a year. Of course, you can adjust the timeline by taking a higher or lower credit load or enrolling in courses over summer and winter break.\nFeeling confused? A school counselor can help you plan your credits and get a clearer idea of your anticipated graduation date.\n‍\nHow to write your anticipated graduation date on a resume\nOnce you know your expected graduation date, it’s time to write it clearly on your resume along with the information about the state and city you’re attending school and the degree type you’re pursuing. Here’s where and how to write anticipated graduation date on resume:\n1. Understand where this date goes\nFortunately, figuring out where to put your anticipated graduation date on your resume is easy: it goes in your education section, along with the information about where you’re attending school and the degree type you’re pursuing.\nLearn more about the ins and outs of your education in this guide about how to list education on a resume.\nTIP: The order of your resume sections depends on your experience. If you’re still in school or a recent graduate, your education section will have more weight (which means putting it closer to the top of your document) because you have less formal experience under your belt. \nNeed to move sections around? That’s easy to do with the drag-and-drop section manager in Teal’s AI Resume Builder.\n\n‍\n‍\nIt can be tough to write a resume when you’re short on formal work experience. If you need some help, read this guide about how to make a resume with no experience.\n‍\n2. Decide on your language\nNext up, determine whether you want to list your upcoming graduation date as “expected” or anticipated.” Both are completely acceptable—ultimately, it’s a matter of personal preference.\nIf you can’t make your choice, take another look at the job description to see if the employer uses certain language when talking about experience and graduation dates. You can mirror that language on your document. \n3. Choose your graduation date format\nA date itself seems pretty straightforward, but there are several different ways you can format dates on your resume:\nNumbers: 01/2025\nShort name: Jan 2025\nLong name: January 2025\nAgain, making your choice is a matter of personal preference. However, consistency matters. Stick with the same date format across your entire resume.\nIt’s easy to set this using Design Mode in Teal’s Resume Builder. Navigate to the Design Tab and then select your desired date format from the dropdown menu. That will automatically apply that format across your resume.\n‍‍\n4. List your date\nAll that’s left to do is list your expected graduation date with your other education information.\nHere are a few accepted ways to write your anticipated graduation date on your resume:\nJuly 2024 (Expected)\nExpected July 2024\nExpected 07/2024\nExpected Graduation: July 2024\nJuly 2024 (Anticipated)\nAnticipated July 2024\nAnticipated 07/2024\nAnticipated Graduation: July 2024\nIn Teal’s Resume Builder, you can set a start date and end date for each educational experience. But just selecting an end date will list that date without the “expected” or “anticipated” label. \nSo, if you’re still in school, skip selecting a start or end date and instead write “Anticipated Graduation: Jan 2025” (using whatever date format you prefer, as long as it’s consistent) in the “Additional Information” section.\n\n‍\nIn Teal’s Resume Builder, you can list your expected graduation date in the “Additional Information” section.\n‍\nWhen you do so, your finished section on your resume will look like this:\n‍\nNeed more help getting all of your skills and qualifications down on paper?

Here are three resume examples, all with differently-formatted dates.\n‍\n‍\n3 common mistakes to avoid when adding anticipated graduation date to a resume\nListing your expected graduation date is surprisingly straightforward, but here are three common mistakes to look out for when adding your graduation date.\n‍\n1. Vague language\nThe point of your expected graduation date is to give companies a clear idea of when you’ll be done and when you’re officially ready and able to work. For that reason, specificity matters.\nAvoid broad dates (like “Summer 2025”) and don’t just give employers a year (“2025”). Instead,  include both the month and the year you plan to finish your schooling.\nOf course, things happen and plans change. But more clarity means you and a potential employer are more likely to be on the same page.\n‍\n2. Inconsistent date formatting\nAre the dates included with your previous positions written with numbers while your expected graduation date is spelled out with the full name of the month?\nWhile it might seem like a trivial detail, inconsistent formatting makes your resume look sloppy. As you proofread your resume, confirm your date format is consistent across your entire document.\nTIP: Set your preferred date format in Teal’s Resume Builder and you can rest assured that all of your resume dates will use a consistent format.\n‍\n3. Outdated information\nOnce you graduate, remember to go in and remove your expected graduation date and replace it with your actual graduation date. When you’ve finished your education, your resume should reflect that. \n‍\nPrepare for post-school success with Teal\nIn the grand scheme of your resume, your expected graduation date is just one line—making it seem like an inconsequential detail.\nBut in reality, an anticipated graduation date provides an employer with crucial information they need when assessing their hiring options.\nMuch like any other part of your resume, clarity and consistency carry a lot of weight.

And while you've probably crafted a good resume, 2024 begs for something a little extra: Your resume needs to be great.\n\nCreating a resume that's clear, concise, and impactful attracts recruiters and engages hiring managers is a must. But, like many job seekers, you might be left trying to figure out how to improve your resume in a way that actually makes a difference.\n\nFortunately, the process is much easier than you think—especially with the right tools\n\nBy the end of this post, you'll be empowered with the insights needed to refine your resume, make a lasting impression, and efficiently track your job search journey for every application.\n\n‍\n\nThe basics of a good resume \nA resume is a document that conveys your professional journey and skillset. Its primary goal? To grab the attention of potential employers and recruiters and offer a snapshot of your professional achievements. \n\nIn other words, your resume is the gateway to new professional opportunities and one of the most important components to nail for job seekers.\n\nBut improving your resume isn't just about listing your past roles or using flashy design; it's about crafting a document that reflects your professional story. It's about ensuring every word and every bullet point adds value and brings you one step closer to that next job interview.\n\n‍\n\nThe main components of a well-written resume\nTo make a resume that stands out and effectively communicates your value proposition, it needs to be formatted in a specific way. \n\nHere's what traditionally constitutes a good resume:\n\n‍\n\n1. Contact information: List your name, phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile URL (if applicable).\n\nContact information to improve a resume\nYour resume should have a clear contact section\n‍\n\n2. Target title: A descriptive header that clearly states the position you're applying to.\n\nTarget title to improve a resume\nA succinct target title draws attention\n‍\n\n3. Professional summary: A concise, impactful \"about me\" resume section that summarizes your professional background, key skills, and career goals (sometimes called your \"resume objective\").\n\nProfessional summary to improve a resume\nUse a professional summary to highlight your career in aggregate\n‍\n\n4. Work experience: A chronological list of your employment history, starting with the most recent position. Each entry should include your job title, the company, dates of employment, and a summary of your achievements.\n\nWork Experience to improve a resume\nA well-written Work Experience section includes relevant achievements\n‍\n\n5. Education: Details about your academic background, including degrees earned, institutions attended, and graduation dates.\n\nCertifications to improve a resume\nImprove your resume by Including education\n‍\n\n6. Skills: List relevant hard skills like specific tools and software you're proficient in.\n\nSkills section to improve a resume \nList hard skills to showcase what tools and software you're familiar with\n‍\n\n7. Certifications and awards: Any relevant certifications, awards, or honors you've received that can bolster your application.\n\nImprove a resume with certifications\nShowcase professional development with certifications on a resume\n‍\n\nIn the end, you should have a well-formated resume with each of these sections.  However, keep in mind there's more than one way to format a resume, so you'll need to choose the best structure based on the job you want and the experience you have. \n\nAn improved resume\nImprove your resume by incorporating the right sections\n‍\n\nCommon resume mistakes to avoid\nCreating a great resume is as much about avoiding pitfalls as it is about including the right information. A resume that stands out for the wrong reasons can make your job search much more challenging. \n\nHere are some common resume mistakes you should steer clear of:\n\n‍\n\n1. Spelling and grammatical errors\nSpelling and grammatical errors can make you appear careless and reduce your chances of landing that interview.  Always proofread your resume multiple times and consider using a tool like Grammarly.\n\n‍\n\n2. Using a one-size-fits-all approach\nCustomization of your resume is key. Sending the same resume for every job application is a common mistake and one that's obvious to hiring managers. Tailor your resume for each role by highlighting the most relevant experiences and skills.\n\nThe good news is that tailoring resumes for each of your applications doesn't need to be overly time-consuming.\n\nIn fact, once you have the basic structure of your resume locked in and a job description in front of you, tailoring is fairly easy. In addition, strategically applying to the roles you're at least 70% qualified for will help with this process.\n\n‍\n\nOn an episode of Hiring Behind The Scenes with Teal Founder and CEO Dave Fano, seasoned Technical Recruiter Tejal Wagadia says,\n\n\"If it takes you more than 5 minutes per resume, per application, it's too much. It's too long. You're doing too much. You're either not applying to the right roles, or you're casting a wider net than you should be.\"\n‍\n\n3. Including too much information\nLengthy, text-heavy resumes are hard to scan for the most important and relevant details.\n\nBe concise and focus on your most impactful achievements and roles. Ideally, keep your resume to one page (maybe two pages if you have extensive experience and you're going for a senior-level role).\n\nRemember: The job of your resume is to showcase just the top 10% of your experience and job history that's 100% relevant to the role you're applying to.\n\n‍\n\n4. Being too vague\nAvoid generic statements and a list of responsibilities or job duties. Be specific about your achievements and impact. Try using a tool like ChatGPT for a resume to create achievements with quantifiable data. For example,\"increased sales by 20%\" instead of \"responsible for sales improvement.\"\n\nBut be ready to explain and back up any concrete examples to a hiring manager during an interview.\n\n‍\n\n5. Using complex jargon\nWhile it's important to showcase your knowledge and expertise, avoid loading your resume with industry-specific jargon. Use clear, simple language that demonstrates your value and is understandable to non-experts.\n\nFilling your resume with complicated jargon can obscure your actual contributions and make it difficult for recruiters to understand the relevance of your experience.\n\n‍\n\n6. Neglecting the format\nA messy, inconsistent format can make your resume hard to read and leave a negative impression. Use a clean, professional layout with clear headings, bullet points, and a consistent font and font size.\n\nAn inconsistent, cluttered format can make your resume difficult to read quickly, frustrating recruiters and reducing your chances of being shortlisted.\n\n‍\n\n7. Omitting keywords\nMany companies use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to filter resumes. Ignoring the relevant keywords can make it hard for hiring professional to find the skills and qualifications they're searching for within the system. \n\nReview the job description and include keywords related to the skills and experiences required for the role.\n\nDid you know? Teal highlights key skills from your job description so you can quickly see which information is most important: \n\nImproving a resume with keywords\nPull the most relevant skills from any job description.\nSign up for free and try Teal today!\n\n‍\n\n8. Including personal information\nAvoid adding personal details such as age, marital status, or religious beliefs. Stick to professional information that supports your application.\n\nAdding unnecessary personal details can be off-putting and unprofessional. It can also expose you to biases and detract attention from your professional qualifications and experiences.\n\n‍\n\n9. Leaving out important details\nWhile keeping your resume concise is important, don't omit crucial information that could enhance your application. Ensure you include all relevant experiences, skills, and accomplishments that align with the job you're applying for.\n\nOmitting important information can lead to missed opportunities to showcase your suitability for the role.\n\nRemember these points as you edit your resume for each role you're applying to. \n\n‍\n\nHow to improve your resume \nRecruiters don't have the time to sift through pages of irrelevant information. \n\nThey're looking for a snapshot of your professional journey that's relevant, comprehensive, and succinct, showcasing only the most pertinent pieces of your experience.\n\nThat's why you need to do everything in your power to learn how to boost your resume by incorporating resume best practices. \n\n‍\n\n8 tips on improving your resume content\n1. Tailor it to the job description\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nAnalyze the job description like a treasure map—it has all the necessary clues you need. \n\nIdentify the key skills and experiences the employer is after and mirror these in your resume. This isn't just about throwing in keywords but about aligning your resume to demonstrate exactly how you fit the bill.\n\n‍\n\n2. Use action verbs\nKick off your sentences with compelling action verbs. Swap out the \"responsible for's\" with dynamic words like \"orchestrated,\" \"engineered,\" or \"spearheaded.\" \n\nThese convey energy and give your accomplishments the spotlight they deserve.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n3. Quantify your achievements\nWherever possible, tie your accomplishments to quantifiable outcomes. \n\nDid you increase sales or efficiency? By how much? \n\nNumbers clearly show your impact and make your claims more credible, but you need to be ready to back them up.\n\n‍\n\n4. Keep it focused\nTry to maintain a clear focus on your key skills and accomplishments. Avoid the temptation to list every task you've ever completed. \n\nIn other words, ditch the clutter and keep the spotlight on your most shining moments to make your resume easier to understand.\n\n‍\n\n5. Prioritize readability\nUse bullet points, headers, and short paragraphs to enhance readability. Your resume should be a smooth read, easily guiding the recruiter's eyes from one point to the next.\n\n‍\n\n6. Integrate relevant keywords\nYou want your resume to be found by hiring professionals within Applicant Tracking Systems, incorporate relevant keywords throughout your content. \n\nThese are often the skills and experiences listed in the job description.\n\n‍\n\n7. Maintain a professional tone \nMaintaining a sense of professionalism with a conversational and engaging tone is great. \n\nAim to strike the right balance to convey your personality without compromising your professionalism.\n\n‍\n\n8. Seek feedback and refine\nGather input from mentors, peers, or someone in your industry Use their feedback to refine your resume continuously. It's all about iteration and refinement!\n\n‍\n\nHow to make a standout resume with Teal\nStepping into the job market can feel like stepping into the unknown. \n\nBut with Teal by your side, you're not just stepping in; you're stepping up. \n\nHere's how you can create that stellar resume with Teal, making sure it's not just seen but also shines.\n\n‍\n\n1.

It's especially useful if you're missing W-2s or tax documentation from past jobs.\nRemember that earnings records may not include informal, cash-based, or short-term jobs. But they provide a great starting point for piecing together your work history timeline.\nReviewing your Social Security earnings records is free and doesn't affect your Social Security benefits. However, the SSA charges a fee to get a copy of your itemized statement of earnings.\n‍\n\n‍\nFor further assistance or to locate the nearest Social Security office, contact the Social Security Administration office. This step can prove helpful, particularly if you're looking to clarify aspects of your credit report or need additional support with your earnings records.\n‍\nHow to get your work history from your previous employer\nWhile not the most efficient option, another way to obtain your full work history is to contact your previous employers directly. Many companies keep records of past employees for a certain number of years.\nYou can call or email your old manager, human resources department, or payroll office to request your dates of employment and job titles. Explain that you are looking to verify your work history. Most will be happy to provide this basic information.\nSome companies may be able to give you more detailed records, such as:\nEmployment verification letter: hire date, job titles, duties, salary, etc.\nW-2 forms or pay stubs: income and withholdings\nPerformance reviews: feedback and achievements\nTraining certificates: professional development\nRecommendation letter: individual contributions\nIf the company has gone out of business, try contacting former coworkers who may recall your tenure. You can also search state archives for dissolved business records.\nThe key is being polite but persistent when requesting your work history. Most human resource (HR) departments will work with you, as they understand the importance of accuracy and are frequently collecting this information themselves when running background checks on candidates.\n‍\nHow to write your employment history\nWhen it comes to writing your employment history on your resume, there are a few key things to keep in mind:\n‍\nQuantify your employment history\nFirst, you'll want to write clear, concise descriptions of each role you've held. Focus on highlighting your responsibilities, achievements, and skills gained. Quantifying your experience can help demonstrate the scope and impact of your work.\nEmployment history bullet examples:\nIncreased sales by 30% over 2 years through implementing a new lead generation strategy.\nManaged a team of 5 sales representatives, exceeding quarterly targets by an average of 15%.\nLed redesign of the company website, resulting in a 20% increase in site traffic.\n Learn more about how to quantify your resume.\n‍\nTailor your employment history for each application\nIt's also important to tailor your employment history for each job you apply to. Identify the skills and experience most relevant to the role, and emphasize those details. You don't need to include every job or task—be selective.\nFor example, if you're applying for a marketing role, highlight marketing campaigns you led or executed. If you're applying for a management role, focus on team leadership experience.\nCarefully tailoring your resume ensures you put your best foot forward and stand out from other applicants.\n‍\nIncorporate your work history into your resume\nIncorporating your work history into your resume is crucial for showcasing your experience to potential employers.\nWith Teal's AI Resume Builder, the process is easy.\nTeal's Resume Builder offers AI tools that analyze your work history and provide helpful suggestions for optimizing your resume content. These recommendations enable you to highlight key bullet points, skills, and experiences that align with the job description.\n‍\n‍\nPlus, Teal's Matching Mode allows you to customize your resume according to the requirements of various job descriptions.\nFor more tips on how to incorporate your work history into your resume, check out this guide on resume work experience.\n‍\nHow to use Teal's AI resume builder to manage your work history\nFirst, you can upload or import your work history from your LinkedIn profile.\n‍\n‍\nThat becomes your base resume.

This customization allows individuals to highlight relevant skills, experiences, and bullets that align with each job they apply for.\n‍\nEmployment history checks\nWhen applying for a new job, it's common for employers to conduct an employment history check to verify your previous work experience and qualifications.\nHere's what you need to know:\nHow employers check employment history\nCall previous employers: Many employers will call your past employers to confirm your employment dates, job titles, and responsibilities. They may also ask about your performance and eligibility for rehire.\nRequest records: Employers can submit written requests to your previous employers asking for documentation of your employment. This may include dates, positions, salary, and other details.\nCheck references: Your listed references may be contacted to provide information about your employment history and character. Choose references who can vouch for your character and background.\nBackground check agencies: Some employers hire third-party agencies to conduct background checks, including employment history verification. Agencies have access to databases to look up past jobs.\nOnline searches: Employers may search for your name online to find additional details about your employment history from sources like LinkedIn or company websites.\n‍\nHow to prepare for employment history checks\nGet your records in order: Compile your own detailed records of all past employment with exact dates, titles, duties, and contact details.\nRefresh your memory: Review key projects, accomplishments, challenges for each role so you can accurately discuss your experience.\nNotify references: Contact references ahead of time to let them know they may be contacted for an employment check.\nExplain gaps: Be ready to briefly explain gaps in your employment history or other notable discrepancies. Focus on the positives.\nUpdate online profiles: Make sure your LinkedIn, website bios, or other online presences align with your official employment history.\nStaying prepared for potential employment history checks helps you put you feel confident and avoid  surprises in the hiring process.\n‍\nDocument your work history to easily update your resume\nKnowing your full work history is crucial for showcasing your skills, experience, and achievements to potential employers. You'll be prepared to highlight relevant accomplishments and provide proof of your background by keeping thorough records of your employment history and former employers.\nWhile it can be difficult to find your employment history, especially if you have long career gaps, doing so will pay dividends in your job search and career advancement.\nA tool like Teal's AI-powered Resume Builder can be invaluable for compiling and organizing your work history in one place.

With recruiters using Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to organize hundreds of resumes, these words are vital to your job search—they're the parameters employers when finding the most qualified candidates in an ATS to interview.\nBy strategically incorporating keywords into your resume, you can align your job applications with requirements, improve your chances of being found during ATS searches, and demonstrate your fit for the role. Below you'll learn how to get it right.\n‍\nWant to find the right resume keywords fast? Use Teal’s AI Resume Builder to identify and incorporate the best keywords for every application.\n‍\nWhat are resume keywords?\nResume keywords are specific words or phrases that an employer uses in a job listing and their internal systems that describe the skills, qualifications, and experiences they're looking for in a candidate. Applicants add these words to their resume (and cover letter!) to align their skills and qualifications with each unique job.\n‍\n‍\nWhy are resume keywords important?\nResume keywords play a crucial role in making sure your application gets noticed. These specific words and phrases help highlight your skills and qualifications in a way that aligns with the job description.\n‍\nBeyond that, resume keywords:\nHelp recruiters determine if a candidate is the best fit for a job\nIncrease your visibility in applicant tracking systems (ATS)\nRelate to the skills, qualifications, and experience required for a position\nMay include industry-specific jargon, software and tools, and other relevant terminology\nOften include both types of resume skills—soft and hard\n‍\nHow applicant tracking systems check for resume keywords\nAn applicant tracking system (ATS) is a tool—like a digital filing system—employers use to organize and manage applications. It helps streamline resume sorting, filtering, and storing, allowing hiring managers and recruiters to handle large volumes of applications more efficiently.\n‍\nWhen you apply through a job portal, the ATS parses your resume. Within the system, recruiters can then search for ATS keywords—specific terms that reflect the skills, qualifications, and experience relevant to the job posting. The system acts like a resume keyword scanner, identifying applications that include these targeted keywords a human hiring professional is searching for, making it easier for a recruiter or hiring manager to find and prioritize the most qualified candidates for a role quickly.\n‍\nWhat impact do resume keywords have on ATS\nDespite the LinkedIn hot takes, the ATS doesn’t make decisions or filter out resumes on its own; recruiters manually search for specific keywords like skills, qualifications, and experiences. If your resume includes the right keywords and speaks the same language as the JD, it will surface.\nThe impact is clear: keywords increase your visibility in the system. Without them, even a highly qualified candidate may be overlooked simply because the resume doesn't align with the terms a human hiring professional is searching for. It’s not about “beating the AI robots;\" it’s about understanding how recruiters look for candidates and making sure your resume is set up to reflect what the job demands.\nFor example: If a job posting lists a required software like Salesforce, the recruiter may search the ATS for that keyword. If your resume doesn’t mention it—even if you have the skill—it won't show up in the recruiter’s results.\n\n‍\nHow to find resume keywords from a job description\nIdentifying resume keywords from a job description (JD) is an essential step in tailoring your resume to stand out to recruiters and land a job interview.\nHere's how you can easily spot the key terms and phrases that employers are looking for:\n‍\n1. Start with the job title and requirements\nThe job title contains relevant keywords more often than not. In fact, the target job titles on your resume should always align with the unique position you're applying for.\nFor example, if you're applying for a \"Marketing Manager\" role, “marketing manager” should appear in your resume alongside related terms like “campaign management,” “content marketing,” or “strategic planning.” Review the job title, responsibilities, and qualifications closely for recurring terms.\n‍\n2. Focus on skills and qualifications\nRead through the “required skills” or “qualifications” section of the JD. Even if you're applying for the same job title over and over, the skills and qualifications might be different.  \nLook for both hard and soft skills like \"data analysis,\" \"project management,\" or \"team collaboration.\" These keywords should be woven into your resume summary, work experience, and more.\nKeep in mind the skills you list in your Skills section should also be found in other parts of your resume to show how you used those proficiencies to have impact.\n‍\n3. Highlight tools and technologies\nMany job descriptions mention specific software, tools, or technologies like \"Salesforce,\" \"Google Analytics,\" or \"Python.\" Including these keywords ensures that your technical expertise aligns with the job requirements and catches the attention of recruiters.\n‍\n4. Look for action verbs and job-specific language\nNote any action verbs that describe what you'll be doing in the role, like \"develop,\" \"implement,\" or \"lead.\" You can use these in your experience section to show how your previous accomplishments align with the tasks in the new role. Also, watch for industry-specific jargon or terminology and incorporate that into your resume where relevant.‍\nAutomate resume keywords\nWhile finding resume keywords on your own is effective, it takes a lot of time. Teal’s AI Resume Builder can help you speed up the process.\nWhen you upload a JD, Teal highlights the most important keywords. It also has a Job Matching so you can see just how well your resume aligns with every unique position. Then, use the suggestions to integrate more job-related skills into your resume to improve your alignment.\n‍\n‍\nHow to include keywords in your resume\nNow that you understand how to get the right keywords from job postings, it’s time to incorporate them into your resume strategically. Each section—from your summary to your work experience—provides an opportunity to naturally embed these terms and demonstrate your fit for the role. Here's how you do it.\n‍\nHow to add keywords to a resume summary\nYour resume summary is an ideal spot to include the top keywords showcasing your core skills and expertise. By using relevant job description keywords, you can immediately show employers that your qualifications align with the role. Keep it concise and focused, ensuring the keywords fit naturally within your professional overview. However, avoid stuffing too many keywords and always strive to maintain a natural and engaging tone.\n‍\nHow to add keywords to a professional headline\nWhen listing your desired job title (also known as a target title), align this as closely as possible with the title you've identified from the job posting.\nFor example, if the job ad is asking for a 'Graphic Designer' with 'branding' and 'digital marketing' experience, make sure 'Graphic Designer' or a very similar title is listed as your target title and that those keywords appear in your professional summary and work experience bullet points if they align with your skills and experiences.\n‍\nHow to add keywords to your work history\nThe Work Experience section is your opportunity to showcase how you've used your skills in practice in a previous job. When detailing your past roles, integrate keywords into the descriptions of your responsibilities and achievements. Aim to showcase impact and demonstrate how you used the skills represented by the keywords to bring about tangible results.\n‍\nHow to add keywords to a skills section\nIn the Skills section, directly include the keywords that highlight your relevant abilities. If 'project management certification,' 'AirTable,' or 'Webflow' are keywords for your targeted role and they’re part of your skillset, make sure they're clearly listed in this section.\n‍\nHow to add keywords to an education section \nFinally, the Education and Certifications sections. Include any degrees, courses, or certifications that are relevant keywords. For example, if 'MBA' or 'Certified Public Accountant' are keywords that popped up in your research and you have these qualifications, make sure they're included.\n‍\nResume keywords list by industry\nDifferent industries prioritize various skills, qualifications, and experiences, which are reflected in the keywords they use in job descriptions and ATS searches.\nIn this section, you'll find curated ATS keyword lists for various industries. These keywords are some of the most commonly sought after by employers and recruiters searching ATS databases for qualified candidates.\n‍\nSales resume keywords \nSales management\nBusiness strategy\nB2B/B2C sales\nCustomer service\nNegotiation\nAccount management\nCustomer acquisition\nCRM\nPipeline management\nLead generation\n‍\nMarketing resume keywords\nDigital marketing\nSocial media\nSearch engine optimization (SEO)\nContent marketing\nBranding\nMarketing strategy\nMarketing research\nROI\nMarketing analysis\nPPC\n‍\nEngineering resume keywords\nSoftware development\nJava\nSQL\nAgile methodologies\nPython\nDesign\nCAD\nTroubleshooting\nSaaS technologies\nMS Office Suite\n‍\nCustomer service resume keywords\nCustomer relations\nProblem resolution\nCustomer satisfaction\nMultitasking\nCommunication skills\nCustomer retention\nComplaint handling\nConflict resolution\nTime management\nRelationship building\nTechnical support\nEmpathy\nActive listening\nTroubleshooting\nCustomer experience\n‍\nProject manager resume keywords\nProject planning\nRisk management\nTime management\nQuality assurance\nTask prioritization\nPMP\nAgile (scrum) methodologies\nBudget management\nProblem solving\nStakeholder management\n‍\nBusiness analyst resume keywords\nData analysis\nProcess improvement\nRequirements gathering\nSQL\nTableau\nBusiness intelligence\nStakeholder management\nSWOT analysis\nAgile methodologies\nFinancial modeling\n‍\nHealthcare resume keywords\nPatient care\nElectronic Health Records (EHR)\nHIPAA compliance\nClinical documentation\nMedical coding\nInfection control\nVital signs monitoring\nMedication administration\nCare coordination\nQuality assurance\n‍\nFinance resume keywords\nFinancial reporting\nBudgeting and forecasting\nRisk management\nInvestment analysis\nAccounting principles\nRegulatory compliance\nFinancial modeling\nMergers and acquisitions\nAuditing\nCost analysis\n‍\nEducation resume keywords\nCurriculum development\nClassroom management\nStudent assessment\nDifferentiated instruction\nEducational technology\nIEP development\nBehavior management\nProfessional development\nLearning strategies\nParent-teacher communication\n‍\nHuman resources resume keywords\nTalent acquisition\nEmployee relations\nPerformance management\nBenefits administration\nWorkforce planning\nHRIS systems\nDiversity and inclusion\nLabor laws\nOnboarding\nCompensation analysis\n\n‍\nHow to identify and include ATS keywords in your resume with Teal\nThe most effective way to find the best keywords for your ATS resume is to review each job description carefully.

And resume gaps? They happen.\n\nSo, if you find yourself ready to tackle your next role but need to know how to explain a gap in resume history, you aren't alone, and there are strategies to address and overcome it to ultimately move forward.\n\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nWhat is an employment gap?\nGaps in employment are any point in your resume between jobs or simply unemployed. A general timeframe for an employment gap is typically six months or more. \n\n‍\n\nHow bad is an employment gap in your resume?\nYou’ve probably heard the age-old saying you should only quit your current job when you have another one lined up. \n\nBut times have changed. And people are beginning to understand that this mindset contributes to the unrealistic expectation that your life should revolve around work when, in fact, sometimes your life has to revolve around, well…life.\n\nNot only that, but today, many employment gaps result from downsizing, layoffs, or even firings—not resignation.\n\nThe important thing to realize is that many people have these discrepancies in their resumes, and resume gaps are starting to matter less to employers.\n\nWhat does matter is staying current in your field and how you explain employment gaps to hiring managers and prospective employers during your job search. \n\n‍\n\nDo employers care about employment gaps in your resume?\nThe short answer here is yes: Employers, recruiters, and hiring managers do care about career gaps in your resume—but only if you can’t offer an explanation or reason. \n\nThe longer answer is that companies may not care about employment gaps nearly as much as they used to—especially in today’s more challenging market. \n\nSimply put? A gap is no longer considered the red flag it once was. \n\n‍\n\nSo why do employers care at all when it's become common for people to have a gap in their resume? \n\nWell, most hiring managers, recruiters, and employers just want to know that you're well-informed on your industry, role, skills, and credentials.\n\nMany fields change quickly with the constant evolution of tech and tools; staying current with industry trends is critical as it ensures you can adapt to the latest advancements and be a valuable asset to an organization.\n\nFortunately, there are several ways you can effectively address resume gaps—and even use it to your advantage. \n\n‍\n\nHow to explain a gap in your resume\n1. Be honest and transparent about your work history\nNever lie about an employment gap in your resume by changing dates or months to make it appear shorter or by trying to hide it altogether. \n\nA hiring manager can verify work history with your previous employers or even by using LinkedIn, so lying is a surefire way to lose the opportunity or potentially get let go later on. \n\n‍\n\nIf you have a significant employment gap on your resume, use your cover letter to explain the situation in further detail. \n\nIn one to two short sentences, briefly explain what caused the employment gap and how you used that time for your personal and professional development and growth. You can then use the rest of the cover letter to reiterate your interest in the position and highlight why you're a great fit. \n\nFor example, if you were out of work for a year due to an illness, you could simply state that you took a medical leave and are fully prepared to re-enter the workforce. You don’t have to mention anything overly personal about this period of unemployment.\n\nAddressing the employment gap in your cover letter allows you to be transparent at the very beginning of the hiring process. You appear more honest and trustworthy—which is a great way to stand out.\n\n‍\n\n2. Use a different resume format\nKnowing what to put on a resume can help you remove focus from your employment gap. For example: \n\n‍\n\nConsider using a hybrid format like the sample resume below. Start with an eye-catching professional summary and your relevant hard skills. Then, add a chronological list of your employment history below. This will help minimize the gaps in your work experience section and draw the reader's focus to your valuable skills instead.\n\nUse a hybrid format to highlight your skills.\nList the reason for a long employment gap as one of your work histories. For example, if you used that time to learn a new skill, work as a stay-at-home parent, or perhaps do some freelancing, highlight it as a job. Adding these elements like hard skills or freelance work on a resume shows a potential employer that you used this time off purposefully.\nHighlight your accomplishments during your time away from work. Just make sure that they’re related to the job you're applying for. For example, spending time away from work to write a book is a relevant accomplishment for a copywriter or someone working in content marketing. \nIncluding your employment gap on your resume not only demonstrates your honesty—it's also an excellent opportunity to show off your creativity, which can help you stand out to employers as well.\n\n‍\n\nShowcase your best with Teal\nTo highlight your best and most relevant qualifications, you need the right tools.\n\nThe free Teal AI Resume Builder has a Drag-and-Drop Editor to arrange each section of your resume—highlight your best and most relevant experience. \n\nSign Up, It's Free\n‍\n\n‍\n\n3. Consider removing a gap in resume history if it’s outdated\nYou can likely remove a resume gap from your resume if you have more recent relevant work history. \n\nEmployment gaps from five years ago or longer mean much less to employers— especially if you’ve had more recent, consistent employment.\n\nThe guideline is only to explain a gap in your resume that happened 1–5 years before the present date. Remember, the job of your resume is to showcase relevant experience; anything older that isn’t relevant shouldn’t be included. \n\nFor example, you don’t have to explain an employment gap from a layoff seven years ago if you’ve held relevant positions since then. Why? Because your resume work experience should only showcase the top 10% of your skills and qualifications that are 100% relevant to the role you’re applying to. \n‍\n\nPro Tip: If you’re feeling stuck, the Teal AI Resume Builder can help you generate bullet points for your work history with the click of a button. (To get quality, metric-driven bullets, make sure to attach a job description to incorporate relevant keywords.)\n\nWrite Achievements With AI\n‍\n\n‍\n4. Share how you spent time during the employment gap\nCompanies have the right to ask you what you were doing during an employment gap. But you can actually use a gap in your resume to your advantage. \n\nIf you went back to school, completed certifications, did some volunteer work, took courses, or learned any new skill, you should include this information.  Professional development like this shows initiative, and employers will appreciate your commitment to your field. \n\nFor example, suppose you spent time away from work to pursue a degree to advance your career. In that case, you can list relevant coursework or research as bullets and highlight the correlation with your employment gap.\n\n‍\n\nWhen it comes to your resume, Senior Technical Recruiter and Career Strategist Kristen Fife says,\n\n“Don’t go into details about employment gaps (i.e., child or elder care and medical issues); you don’t want to even open that door.\n‍\nIf it's less than one year, label the break as a sabbatical. For longer gaps, cover them with relevant ways you've kept up your skills (the biggest concern of hiring managers is skills erosion). \n\nDon’t try to overemphasize non-related activities as professional (i.e., a stay-at-home parent or caregiver managing family finances does not qualify as a financial analyst or accountant).\nInstead, include things like writing (articles, blogs, professional content), teaching or taking classes, upskilling including boot camps, volunteering in your field, and occasional consulting are all ways to show hiring managers you've kept up your skills.\"\n‍\n\nHow to explain resume gaps in your cover letter\nA cover letter provides ample opportunity for job seekers like you to explain bullet points, personal ambitions, and even employment gaps. But if you’re going to address a gap in your cover letter, you don’t have to go into specifics.\n\nGive potential employers enough information to explain the break in work, but don’t provide a lot of personal details. Writing one to two straightforward sentences is acceptable. Keep the rest of your letter focused on your active work history, relevant skills, credentials, impact, and why you’re a good fit for the role. \n\n‍\n\nPro Tip: Use Teal's AI cover letter generator within the Resume Builder to generate personalized cover letters for every position you apply to.\n\n\nCreate personalized cover letters in one click.\n‍\n\nIf you need some cover letter inspiration, check out these 1200+ cover letter examples.\n\n‍\n\nHow to cover career gaps during job interviews\nIf you have a significant employment gap in your resume, be prepared for it to come up during the job interview process. But remember, employment gaps are more common than you think.\n\nIt's also important to understand that employers only tend to care about recent unemployment gaps, so don't stress about every single one. Employers aren't going to be worried about unemployment gaps that happened several years ago.\n\nYou can prepare for these interview questions while job searching, creating talking points that will help you answer them smoothly. Practice this scenario a few times with a friend or family member until you feel comfortable. Again, remember not to overshare—just be clear and honest.\n\n‍\n\nWith that said, here are some more key takeaways for explaining an employment gap during an interview:\n\nKeep the conversation about an employment gap brief. You don't need to go into detail unless you were improving your skill set while away from work. \nDon’t apologize. You shouldn’t feel guilty about a career break because your life doesn’t revolve completely around your work. \nYou don’t always have to share hard or technical skills you’ve learned away from work. For example, if you lived through an experience that has taught you more about empathy, you can always talk about it. Soft skills like this almost always translate into the workplace. \n‍\n\nBridge the gap with Teal\nExplaining a career gap in your job application isn’t as difficult as it may seem. If you’re honest and transparent about why, it shouldn’t affect your chances of securing a new job. \n\nAn excellent resume and cover letter with relevant skills, qualifications, and impact can help you explain or even take the focus from an employment gap—and that’s where Teal comes in. \n\nTeal’s AI Resume Builder, sample resumes, and resume templates can help you craft a career history that minimizes the impact of employment gaps and helps you land your dream job.\n\n‍\n\nDon’t let  gaps in your work history hold you back.

All of your work experience and accomplishments are down on paper, so proofreading should be a breeze, right?\n\nIn reality, resume editing deserves just as much (if not more) time and attention as resume writing. Careful editing means you not only catch pesky typos or errors but also adequately highlight your accomplishments, demonstrate your skills, align yourself with the job description, and stand out from the other job seekers and applicants. \n\nWondering how to go beyond light proofreading and learn how to edit a resume that lands interviews? This guide to editing your resume covers:\n\nPreparing to edit your resume\nHow to edit resume content\nHow to format your resume\nHow to edit your resume on different platforms\n‍\n\nUnderstanding the basics of a resume\nReviewing your entire resume at once can feel overwhelming. When you understand the different sections, you can break your document into chunks and review them one at a time. In general, this means taking a close look at the following sections:\n\nName and contact information (included in your resume header)\nTarget title\nProfessional summary \nPrevious employment and work experience\nSkills\nEducation\nThese make up the skeleton of any resume, but there are other parts of a resume candidates can include depending on their industry, career path, and experience level. \n\n‍\n\nPreparing to edit your resume\nYou might think that editing is an afterthought. It’s the step you rush through before hitting “submit.”\n\nBut carefully reviewing and polishing your resume isn’t a final, quick box to check in your job search. Ask any professional resume writer or editor, and they’ll tell you that editing isn’t a part of the process—it’s a process all on its own that warrants time, energy, and attention.\n\nWhat to do before editing your resume\n\nIdentify a specific job description to tailor your resume to. A well-edited resume isn’t just one that’s free of typos and mistakes. An optimized resume should match a specific position.\nCarefully review the job posting. It’s not enough to simply have the job description. You need to read it thoroughly and pay close attention to the relevant keywords (meaning skills, responsibilities, and requirements) that should be incorporated in your application materials. \nPro Tip: With the AI resume maker, you can attach your desired job posting and see the keywords you should use to tailor your resume to the job description.\n\nResearch the company. Check out their website and LinkedIn page to understand the company’s mission, culture, team size, and recent happenings. Even if you don’t use this information directly with your job application, it helps you vet the companies you’re interested in and gives you useful context as you connect with hiring managers and move through the process.\nCompile a list of your accomplishments and experiences. Reflect on your past experiences and make note of key projects or achievements, positive feedback, and other impressive results. Save this resource in a personal folder (you don’t want it tied to work folders as you’ll need access after you leave) and add to it throughout your career. You’ll be glad to have that information ready the next time you’re on the job hunt.\nUse action verbs. As you adjust the bullet points on your resume, pay attention to verb choice. Print or bookmark a list of action verbs to make that process faster and easier.\nCreate an environment where you can focus. Remember, editing isn’t something to speed through while you’re distracted. Set yourself up with a quiet space where you can zone in on improving your materials without interruptions.\n‍\n\nHow to edit your resume content\nAfter gathering your professional materials, you’re ready to proofread and polish your resume to make it as compelling as possible. Here’s how to edit each section of your resume:\n\n‍\n\nResume header\nYour name and contact information go at the top of the page in your resume header. It’s an easy section to overlook (because it’s so short and straightforward). But as you edit:\n\nConfirm your name is the largest text on your entire document.\nCheck that your contact information is professional, accurate, and still active (especially if it’s been a long time since you updated your resume).\nEnsure your location is current, correct, and only lists your city and state instead of a full address.\nClean up your LinkedIn URL (view your profile and then click the pencil next to “public profile and URL” on the right side of the page to adjust the link).\n‍\n\nTarget title\nWhile it might seem strange to include a job title on your resume, this can grab the attention of the hiring manager and immediately present you as a qualified fit.\n\nKeep in mind that your resume title doesn’t have to be the title you held at your last job. You can adjust it to something that’s representative of your experience but is also a better match for the job you’re applying for. As you work on this:\n\nReturn to the job description to determine what words they’re using to describe the role.\nAdd some impact by incorporating a value proposition. Example: Instead of saying “Event Manager” say “Event Manager | Coordinating end-to-end marketing event planning and execution to drive attendance and ROI”\n‍\n\nProfessional summary\nWhen it comes to writing your resume, this is one of the most daunting sections. It feels like you need to condense all of your skills, past positions, and achievements into one short, punchy paragraph. Here’s how to make your professional summary section even stronger:\n\nRevisit the job description to understand what qualifications they’re emphasizing. That’s your sign that those should appear in your resume summary. If a decade of experience is one of the requirements, lead with that. Example: “As a driven sales manager with 10+ years of experience in fintech…”\nTrim it down. As you write, you focus on getting words down on paper. It’s when you edit that you can weed through and keep only the most impactful and impressive pieces. Your summary doesn’t need to be long—it should only be three to five sentences.\n‍\n\nWork experience\nA large portion of your resume is dedicated to your past jobs. As you edit, your goal isn’t just to share what you did in those previous roles but also to showcase how it’s relevant to the position you’re applying for. As you work on your work experience section:\n\nConfirm the start and end date of each role to ensure they’re accurate.\nReview the verb tense for your bullet points. Previous positions should use past tense (“managed”) while current roles use present tense (“manage”). \nAdjust your action verbs to add impact and keep your content fresh. \nAdd quantifiable bullet points to share not just what you did but why it mattered. Example: “Improved customer relationships, increasing repeat business by 20%.”\nFocus on relevance by revisiting the responsibilities outlined in the job description and connecting the dots to your own experience. \n\n‍\n\nSkills\nYour skills section is like your highlight reel. It’s where you list the competencies that you’ll bring to that position. To give this short section maximum impact:\n\nReturn to the job description to identify what strengths the employer is seeking and add them to your own section (provided you honestly possess them, of course). \nEnsure you have a healthy balance of technical skills and soft skills. \nMake sure your skills section isn’t doing all of the talking. As you emphasize certain competencies, return to your summary and work history section to provide examples of times you applied those strengths in the real world.\n‍\n\nEducation\nIf you think of your education section as the place where you list your degree, then it’ll likely stay stagnant. But if you treat it as a spot where you can share all of the relevant things you’re learning in your career, it requires a little more attention. To give your education section a boost:\n\nAdd any certifications, courses, publications, or other learning opportunities that are relevant to the role.\nRemove outdated or irrelevant educational experiences (there’s no need to list high school on your resume).\nTake some time to work through those checklists as you review each section of your resume. If you want to dig even deeper, check out this comprehensive guide for more in-depth tips on resume editing. \n\n‍\n\nHow to format your resume\nProfessional resume editors know editing isn’t all about words. You also need to dedicate some focus to formatting and perfecting the visual appearance of your document so it’s clean, polished, and easy for recruiters to read. \n\n‍\n\nResume section order\nThis starts by paying close attention to your resume organization, meaning the order of your sections. There isn’t one “right” order for your resume. Instead, your goal is to put the most pertinent information toward the top so it’s unmissable and positions you as the best applicant for the opportunity.\n\nFor example, if the posting lists a specific degree type as a prerequisite for the position, you could move your education section closer to the top. Or, if you’re an entry-level employee without any formal work experience, you might put your skills section before your professional history.\n\nIn short, playing with the order is a solid way to demonstrate relevance without actually adjusting any of the content on your resume. Teal's AI Resume Builder makes this painless. You can click and drag your sections to automatically reorder them on your document. \n\n‍\n\nResume layout and design\nBeyond adjusting the order, there are a few other design tips to keep in mind as you enhance and edit your resume layout: \n\nChoose a clear, easy-to-read font (Helvetica, Times New Roman, and Roboto are all popular and recruiter-approved choices)\nConfirm your font size is large enough so employers can review your information without squinting or zooming\nAdjust your margins and white space so your document looks organized and balanced\nThese are also simple to do within Teal's resume creator. In the “design” menu, choose from four different resume templates to instantly adjust your document’s appearance. Regardless of which resume template you select, you can also customize your font, accent color, and margins using easy dropdown menus.\n\nTeal's Resume Builder editor options\nTeal's Resume Builder editor options\nBuild Your Resume for Free\n‍\n\nHow to edit a resume in different file formats and software programs\nWhat about the logistics involved in editing your resume? That will depend on your file format and what tools you used to create your resume in the first place. Editing a resume in a word processor like Microsoft Word is different from editing one in a design program like Canva, for example.\n\nHere’s a quick look at some of the most popular design and word-processing programs and how to edit accordingly: \n\n‍\n\nHow to edit a resume in Microsoft Word\nMicrosoft Word's editor options\nOpen your file in Word.\nIf your resume is a PDF, navigate to “File,” “Open,” and then find your document. Be aware that converting a PDF back to a Word document will usually result in some jumbled formatting. To avoid this, consider using an AI Resume Builder instead.\nAdjust and edit your content.\nOn the “Home” tab, use the buttons to adjust your font and colors.\nUse the “Layout” tab to adjust your margins.\nWhen you’re ready, click “File,” “Save As,” and then name your document something intuitive and recognizable so you can easily find it when you need it.\nOnce you're ready to export your file, you'll want to download the resume in a PDF or Word file format.\n‍\n\nHow to edit a resume in Google Docs\nGoogle Doc's editor options\nEditing your resume in Google Docs is comparable to Microsoft Word, as both are popular word processors.\n\nOpen your file in Google Docs.\nIf your resume is a PDF, navigate to “File,” “Open,” and then find your document, either within your Google Drive or locally on your computer. Like Word, be aware that converting a PDF to a Google Doc can cause strange formatting issues you’ll need to fix.\nAdjust and edit your content.\nUse the menu at the top of the page to adjust your font and colors.\nIf you need to adjust your margins, click “File,” “Page Setup,” and enter new values for your margin sizes.\nWhen you’re ready, name your document something intuitive before clicking “File,” “Download,” and choosing the file type you’d like to export to. \n‍\n\nHow to edit a resume in Canva\nCanva's editor \nIn general, it’s best to avoid using Canva for creating your resume. While it’s a powerful program, the results aren’t always friendly to applicant tracking systems (ATS). That’s because an ATS can’t read icons or design elements. Designs can be too complex and cluttered, and the process of editing and updating quickly becomes cumbersome. \n\nHowever, if you do need to edit your resume in Canva, here’s how:\n\nOpen your file in Canva.\nIf your resume is already created in Canva, navigate to that file.\nIf you need to import a resume, click “Create a Design” and “Import File.”\nClick into different sections on the document to adjust the text, colors, sizing, and more.\nWhen you’re ready to export, click “Share,” “Download,” select your file type, and press the “Download” button.\n‍\n\nHow to edit a resume in LinkedIn\nSelect the pencil icon next to any section to edit on LinkedIn\nLinkedIn is like a digital version of your resume, but it’s not the same as a resume. That said, it can be a big help when creating your first draft. If you need to add or change your information, you can update any section of your LinkedIn profile by selecting the pencil icon.\n\nPro Tip: With Teal, you can import your LinkedIn profile to get your resume started and revise from there.\n\nEdit Your Resume for Free\n‍\n\nHow to edit a resume in Teal\nTeal’s editor lets you drag and drop to reorder sections and even hide information if you’d prefer not to show on certain versions of your resume.\n\nYou can edit your Teal resume three ways:\n\n1. Select the pencil icon next to any section of text to manually revise any text-based information on your resume.\n\nSelect the pencil icon in Teal's resume builder to edit sections manually\n2. Select the magic wand icon (next to the pencil icon) to use AI to rewrite sections of your resume. \n\nSelect the magic wand icon in Teal's resume builder to rewrite sections\n3. Navigate to Design Mode (select “Design” in the top menu) to access more editing tools including: \n\nFormat settings\nTemplates\nStyle settings\nSection order\n‍\n\nCan you edit a resume on your phone?\nWhile you can edit a Google Doc resume on a mobile device using the Docs app, or a PDF using the Adobe Acrobat app, stick with a computer instead. Your phone has a smaller screen which makes it harder to fill in details, adjust your formatting, and add the necessary polish. It’s likely you’ll create more mistakes than you fix.\n\nThe process will feel a lot less stressful on a desktop or laptop. But with that said, it’s worth taking a look at how your resume comes across on mobile to make sure the content isn’t jumbled—just in case a recruiter reviews it that way.\n\nPro Tip: You can edit any resume format—whether it’s a .doc, PDF, or your LinkedIn profile—by uploading it to Teal's Resume Builder and then save and name each version. It’s easy to find the exact resume you need, without wasting time searching or re-updating. \n\n‍\n\nHow to update your resume\nYour resume isn’t something you need just once. When the average person holds 12 different jobs in their lifetime, it’s safe to assume you’ll be involved in a job search several times throughout your career. \n\nThat’s why it’s so beneficial to commit to regularly updating your resume. When you’re ready to look for a new job, you only need to knock the dust off—rather than adding years of history.\n\nUpdating your resume will involve all of the typical tailoring and editing steps outlined above. However, you’ll also need to: \n\nAdd current or recent roles or experiences\nRefresh your skills to keep pace with changes in your industry\nRemove outdated information (your resume shouldn’t go back further than 15 years)\nTo stay on top of your resume, set a date on your calendar for every six months to a year to comb through your information and make any necessary updates. Doing so means, if and when you’re ready to hunt for a new position, your resume will only be one year old at most.\n\n‍\n\nEdit and enhance your resume with Teal\nRemember this: your resume is only as good as your editing. The editing process isn’t an afterthought or formality to rush through—it’s a crucial step that helps you catch any mistakes and present yourself as the best fit for the jobs you want most.\n\nFortunately, you don’t need to tackle editing on your own. Teal's versatile resume maker will make it easy to polish your design, refine your content, re-order your sections, and keep track of all of the different versions of your resume so you can always find what you need. \n\nReady to create and edit your best resume?

It’s polished, intuitive, and accessible, and your content and design stay consistent across programs and devices—without turning into a jumbled mess. \n\nBut when it comes time to edit that PDF resume? Well, suddenly PDF files don’t seem quite so friendly. Unlike Word files, PDFs are typically static and read-only documents. They aren’t meant to be changed, which means you’ll need the right software—or another workaround—to edit PDF files.\n\nRest assured, it’s doable. This guide covers what you need to know about how to edit a resume in PDF form, along with an introduction to Teal’s AI Resume Builder and how it can help you create and edit your existing PDF resume, or create one from scratch (without all of the cursing at your computer):\n\nHow to edit a resume in PDF format\nHow to save a resume as a PDF\nThe easiest way to edit and format PDFs\nFAQs about PDF resumes\nStruggling to update your resume and land interviews? Get started with Teal’s AI Resume Builder today.\n\n‍\n\nHow to edit a resume in PDF format\nOne of the biggest perks of a PDF resume is that it locks your content and formatting in place. But that also means it’s not easy to edit text or other aspects of your finished document. It’s not as simple as opening a word processor and jumping into the editing process like you would with a Word file or Google Docs.\n\nPDF editing might not seem intuitive, but it’s still possible. Here are three of the simplest and most common methods you can use to edit a PDF. \n\n‍\n\n1. Using Teal’s Resume Builder\nUltimately, you’re not just trying to figure out the logistics of a PDF file. You’re trying to create your very best resume—one that gets you a step closer to your desired job.\n\nThat’s where Teal’s AI Resume Builder comes in. Sure, it will help you do the basic job when you need to edit PDF files. But unlike the other document formatting and PDF editors out there, it’s made specifically for resumes, which means it has prompts, guidance, and features to help your resume stand out from the competition.\n\nHere’s how to get started when you have a PDF resume you want to edit with Teal:\n\nLogin to your Teal account (or create one if you don’t have one already)\nTeal login\nCreate a free account in Teal to get started editing your resume\nNavigate to the Resume Builder in the left pane\nresume tool teal\nSelect \"Resume Builder\" to edit or create a new resume in Teal\nClick the “New Resume” button\nedit a pdf with resume builder\nSelect \"New Resume\" to create a resume in Teal\nIn the top right, click “Menu” and then “Import Resume or LinkedIn”\nexport pdf resume\nSelect \"Import resume or LinkedIn\" to edit an existing PDF resume\nUpload your resume by dragging and dropping it into the designated space or finding it on your computer and clicking “Open”\nEdit Your PDF Resume for Free\nupload pdf resume files\nYou can start editing an existing resume in Teal's AI Resume Builder by uploading and existing Word or PDF resume\nTeal will bring all of the text from your PDF resume into the platform, where you can edit the content within labeled text sections in the left pane and use the checkboxes to easily add or remove content from your resume. \n\nYou’ll quickly see that it’s a lot more user-friendly than trying to adjust the content of a locked PDF. Click “Save” on each section when you make any changes and watch them automatically update on your document in the right pane. \n\nai resume tools\nTeal's AI Resume Builder helps you write and rewrite resume bullet points with AI\nWhen it comes to the content itself, Teal does more than make surface-level changes to things like font and punctuation.

Using Adobe Acrobat\nAnyone can view a PDF document on their computer (that’s part of the appeal), but editing requires premium software.\n\nWhile there are plenty of software programs dedicated to editing PDFs, one of the first places people turn is to Adobe, the original creator of PDFs (“portable document format,” in case you want to impress at your next trivia night).\n\nAdobe Acrobat is a tool specifically for PDFs. You can merge and split PDFs, add comments and mark up documents, rotate and crop pages, and most importantly, edit text and images.\n\nThis software isn’t free, though, and there are several plans and pricing options. Both Adobe Acrobat Standard and Adobe Acrobat Pro will give you basic editing capabilities. However, to access all Acrobat editing tools, you’ll need the “Pro” option for $19.99 per month. \n\nIf you decide to pay for the software, it’s pretty straightforward to edit PDF documents: \n\nOpen your file in Acrobat (you can use it on your browser, desktop, or mobile) \nSelect “Edit” at the top\nEdit your text, add new text, change your font (including your font size, color, and type), organize pages, and more\nClick the three dots in the top menu, select “Download this file,” and then choose your file format\nedit resume with adobe\nAdobe Acrobat offers PDF editing options at a price\nEven though it’s built specifically to help you edit a PDF, it’s not a perfect system. Changing text can quickly lead to messy formatting on your document, which can be clunky to fix within the platform. \n\n‍\n\n3. Using an online PDF editor\nIf you can’t stomach the price tag of Adobe Acrobat, there are plenty of other software options and online tools that fit the bill as PDF editors. And, even better, they’re completely free. Some of the most popular include:\n\nCanva\nPDF24 Creator\nPDF Candy\nThere are some nuances to each of them, but in general, PDF editors work like this: You upload your PDF document directly to the tool and it will turn the text blocks in your document into a collection of text boxes you can edit. \n\nAll of the above PDF editor options have capabilities to change PDF text, so you can adjust your content or add entirely new information (like listing new jobs or adding more bullet points for your quantifiable bullet points). You can also tweak the appearance as you edit your resume, whether you want to update fonts with a new font style, add images, or choose an accent color. \n\nedit resume with online tool\nFree online resume editing software is another way to edit locked text in PDF resumes\nWhen you’re happy with your resume PDF you can download your resume.\n\n‍\n\n3. How to save a resume as a PDF\nPDFs are polished and professional, making them the top file format choice for resumes. Fortunately, it’s easy to make pretty much any document—regardless of where you created it originally—into a PDF.\n\nWhen you’ve made your edits and are ready to save your resume as a PDF, here’s how to do so in a variety of popular platforms: \n\nCanva: Click “Share” in the top right corner, select “Download,” select “PDF Standard” or “PDF Print” as your file type, and click “Download.”\nIndeed: Click “Download Resume” (to the right of your resume if you’re on a computer or at the bottom of the page if you’re on a mobile device) to save your resume in PDF format.\nGoogle Docs: Click “File,” select “Download,” and then select “PDF Document.”\nMicrosoft Word: Click “File” at the top left of your Word document, select “Save As,” choose “PDF” from the file format dropdown, and then click “Export.”\nTeal: Click “Export PDF” at the top of the page and your resume will automatically download as a PDF.\nTo learn more about the logistics of tweaking your resume, check out this detailed post about how to edit a resume. \n\n‍\n\nThe easiest way to edit and format PDFs\nPDFs have a lot of advantages, but they weren’t made for editing.

Aside from being sub-optimal for job seekers looking to position themselves as the ideal candidate for the job, this resume import feature along with the \"easy apply\" option (for jobs posted on LinkedIn) is not standard for job applications.\n\nThe majority of online applications still ask for a PDF upload of your resume, because it’s the format they're most familiar parsing within their ATS (Applicant Tracking System).\n\nThat's because in-house recruiters often use a tool to scan resumes for specific keywords that align with the job listing. Which means:\n\nYou need to customize your resume to line up with each job posting.\nYou need to have a PDF resume file. \nTo use your existing resume, and not have to go through the hassle of creating one from scratch, you can use one of three methods to download your resume from LinkedIn:\n\n‍\n\nLooking to download your resume from LinkedIn quickly? Try Teal's Resume Builder LinkedIn to Resume feature.\n\n‍\n\nHow to Download Your Resume from LinkedIn\nTo clarify, LinkedIn isn’t a resume. \n\nSure, it has your work history and the option to attach a resume, but it will not suffice for most applications without major edits. You can’t simply copy-paste your LinkedIn profile page URL and move on.\n\nThat said, there are a few easy ways to upload pre-existing work experience data from LinkedIn to save you time and energy.\n\nMethod 1 (easiest): Teal's LinkedIn to Resume feature\nDownloading your LinkedIn profile from LinkedIn itself is easy too. More on that method later.\n\nBut what makes Teal the “easy method” is it requires only one click, and you get additional features you’ll need before sending out that resume—particularly, customization, ATS compatibility, and keyword matching.\n\n\n‍\n\nHere’s a step-by-step guide for converting your LinkedIn profile to a resume with Teal:\n\nSign up for a free account with Teal. \nOn the first page, you’ll see a three-step process for getting started, including \"Save a Job\", \"Import your Resume\", and \"Apply for Jobs.\"\nSelect \"Import your Resume\" and a pop-up window appears. \nNavigate to your LinkedIn profile and select \"View Profile\" in the top right corner and grab the URL. Copy and paste the URL into the input bar on the pop-up in Teal. Hit “Import your LinkedIn profile.\"\nhow to download resume from linkedin\nTeal's LinkedIn to Resume feature allows job seekers to import their LinkedIn profile to create a resume\nThat’s it! It’s essentially just grabbing your LinkedIn profile URL and putting it in the right field. Once uploaded, Teal organizes the data into sections you can shift around, select and deselect, edit, and so on.\n\nTeal resume template\nTeal offers several resume templates and design options\nIt doesn’t just create an ATS-friendly resume straight from LinkedIn by checking it against keywords you should use for a particular job title. Nor does Teal simply make a resume that looks professional.\n\nTeal's Matching Mode feature checks the job listing you’re applying for, and makes it simple and easy to customize your resume to match that posting.\n\nIf you already have a Teal profile and need to reimport your LinkedIn profile, you can:\n\nClick on the “Resume Builder” tab on the left sidebar.\nTeal resume builder\nTeal includes a resume builder along with a job tracker, work styles assessment, and CRM-like contact and company manager\nHit the “Menu” tab next to the “New Resume” button.\nTap “Import Resume or LinkedIn” from the drop down menu.\nupload resume from linkedin\nSelect \"Import Resume from LinkedIn in Teal's \"New Resume\" dropdown menu to create a PDF resume from your LinkedIn profile URL\nAppend or overwrite your information.\nreplace previous profile sections\nYou can overwrite or append your previous LinkedIn profile import within Teal\nHow is Teal better than creating your own resume from scratch?\n\nIf you’ve ever created a resume from scratch—and if you’re here it’s likely because you’re avoiding doing that very thing—you know how long it takes.\n\nYou don’t know what keywords to use, unless you carefully comb the listing yourself. You have to painstakingly adjust your resume, research best formatting, and adjust for every single job listing.\n\nAnd, don’t forget, you may not know if recruiters are even reading your resume correctly because you may not understand whether or not your resume is ATS compatible (tip: no images!).\n\nMethod 2 (fastest): Linkedin to PDF format\nThere are actually two processes for downloading your resume as a PDF file from LinkedIn. Both are simple and quick. The first is just two easy steps:\n\nClick on your LinkedIn profile, and select “More” in your profile header.\nClick “Save PDF”\ndropdown menu linkedin\nSelect \"Save to PDF\" from LinkedIn's dropdown menu to create a resume from your LinkedIn profile\nThis method is perhaps the easiest, and LinkedIn even adds a nice side bar of color for a little flair. \n\nLinkedIn to pdf\nExample of a resume downloaded directly from a LinkedIn profile\nWhile it is nice to have a resume automatically created with formatting and a summary, it doesn’t exactly read like a resume. \n\nThe summary is too long, and being that it’s a PDF, it’s not easy to edit without doing a conversion first. And conversions of PDFs don’t always retain their formatting. You might end up doing more work in the long run than you would simply making a resume from scratch, or uploading it to Teal.\n\nMethod 3 (longest): LinkedIn to Resume Builder to PDF format\nThe second option LinkedIn offers is five steps.\n\nLog in to LinkedIn and click the “Jobs” tab (suit case icon on mobile).\nSelect “Resume Builder\" from the sidebar.\nlinkedin resume builder\nYou can find LinkedIn's Resume Builder from the Jobs tab\nA pop-up will appear. Click “Create from profile.\"\nThe page will refresh and you’ll see another pop-up asking you to type in or select your desired position. Enter and click “Apply.\"\njob description keywords\nChoose a saved LinkedIn job to tailor your resume to a job\nHit \"Download resume as PDF\" to save it to your computer.\nhow to download resume from linkedin as pdf\nSelect the \"Download to PDF\" button to download your resume from LinkedIn's Resume Builder\nYou should see the PDF file in the downloads folder of your computer. If you go back to the resume builder tab, you’ll also see recent resumes there, in case you need to easily download it again.\n\nWhile this is designed to be as easy as possible, there are some downfalls to directly downloading or saving your resume from LinkedIn. \n\nCommon issues when downloading your resume from LinkedIn (and how to avoid them)\nThe biggest downfall of downloading your resume directly from LinkedIn is the formatting.\n\nHow you input your information into LinkedIn matters as it will appear the exact same way on your resume file.\n\nNote: If you want to optimize your LinkedIn profile to appear in more job searches by hiring managers for a particular job, Teal's Chrome extension includes a free LinkedIn Profile Reviewer. Learn more: LinkedIn Profile Review with a Chrome Extension).\n\nOptimize Your LinkedIn Profile\n‍\n\nIn fact, if you don’t create your LinkedIn profile exactly like you would a resume, you’re guaranteed to need changes to your PDF file for it to appear professional and be parsed correctly by the ATS.\n\nBeyond that, there is the fact you’re downloading a PDF version of your resume. So, if you do want to make some changes, you’re going to have to convert it into a word processing file format first, or purchase the premium version of Adobe Acrobat. \n\nCompanies will not reach out and ask for another resume. They will simply exclude you from the candidate pool. \n\nHere’s what a downloaded LinkedIn resume looks like using the five simple steps above: \n\nlinkedin resume\nExample of a resume downloaded from LinkedIn's Resume Builder\nThere are other downfalls, too.\n\nIf you don’t have a premium LinkedIn subscription (which starts at $29.99/ month for a LinkedIn Premium Career membership), you can’t choose which sections appear in your downloaded resume. \n\nlinkedin section\nLinkedIn's Resume Builder user experience is similar to the profile page editing experience\nLastly, LinkedIn has only made downloading your resume possible if it’s in English. This makes it a very limited tool for a good chunk of LinkedIn users. \n\nHow to customize your LinkedIn-downloaded resume for every application (and why)\nIf you’re looking at the example above, or you’ve already downloaded your resume from LinkedIn, you’ve probably noticed the formatting isn’t great.\n\nThat’s just one reason to customize your resume, but there’s a much larger and more important reason:\n\nYou need to tailor your resume to every job. It’s time consuming. It’s painstaking. It feels like a full-time job by itself. But customizing your resume to fit the job listing is the best way to improve your job search.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause hiring managers are filtering resumes by specific keywords and qualifications in their application trackers to look for required skills and past experiences.\n\nNow you’re thinking, “but if I just write down everything I did within that job, it should automatically work, right?\"\n\nMaybe. But you don’t want to bank on maybe. They may be looking for your skillset but looking for synonyms of the skills you listed. You want to increase your chances of outshining the competition for that role. One way to do that is to ensure you’re the best match.\n\nHow do you customize your resume for each job at scale?\nThere are several things you need to do to tailor your resume for each opportunity:\n\nScan the job descriptions for any keywords, phrases, or tasks that particularly jump out. Naturally incorporate these throughout your resume.\nResearch your potential employers for any language they commonly use, targets they want to hit, industries or customers they speak to that you may have experience working with, etc.\nAdjust the language to be more action based, personalized, and of course, inclusive of keywords used in the job description.\nIt sounds like a lot, and it really can be if you don’t have the right tools in place.\n\nTeal's Matching Mode feature speeds up the process by identifying the keywords to include for each job, then helping you naturally weave them into your resume.\n\nWhen using Teal’s AI Resume Builder, each bullet point and section of your resume become moveable objects. You can select or deselect, and organize each sentence to your liking, to create your resume.\n\nWhat makes this a time saver is that you can ask its AI to instantly write and rewrite several sentences or bullet points to summarize work you’ve done throughout your career, and simply select the ones you need to match the job listing.\n\nprofile section linkedin\nYou can include or exclude any information from your LinkedIn profile by selecting or deselecting checkboxes within Teal's Resume Builder\nFor instance, you might be applying for a Content Director position at a company that requires some experience in content production and social media. The next application might also be for a Content Director position, but they may be looking for more reporting experience. \n\nYou could have experience in all of the above, and create bullet points within both your LinkedIn profile and the Resume Builder. The latter allows you to shift those points around, and exclude or include only what’s relevant to recruiters.\n\nReady to use Teal’s LinkedIn to Resume feature and start customizing your resume with Teal’s AI Resume Builder?

Think again.\nBullet points summarizing what you did in your previous jobs aren’t enough to catch the attention of hiring managers. You need to dive deeper into your specific actions and accomplishments, the impact you made, and the outcome or end goal you achieved for your employer.\nIt sounds like a lot of information to get across in a few resume bullet points, but a STAR method resume can help. It’s an acronym for situation, task, action, and result—and it’s a winning recipe for a standout resume. This guide breaks down the STAR method and how to apply it to your resume.‍\nLooking to transform your resume from a list of duties into a powerful showcase? Create a STAR method resume with Teal's AI Resume Builder.\n‍\nWhat is the STAR method?\nThe STAR method is a framework typically applied when answering interview questions. However, you can also use the STAR method to craft a compelling and metric-rich resume. Here’s a breakdown of the letters in the acronym:\n\n‍\nAgain, this framework is most frequently used in job interviews—especially when answering behavioral interview questions (those “Tell me about a time when…” questions that all job seekers dread) or achievement-driven questions like, “What are you most proud of?”\nBut this approach can be equally useful for transforming your resume bullet points from flat and generic to clear and impactful. \nFor example, take a look at how using the STAR method transforms this single bullet point:\nWithout the STAR method: \nAssisted customer base with inquiries and resolved issues.\nWith the STAR method: \nImplemented a streamlined ticketing system, resulting in a 30% reduction in response times and a 25% increase in customer satisfaction within three months.\nIt’s not hard to see the difference. The first bullet does nothing more than give insight into your previous job duties, not how you exceeded them. In comparison, applying the four elements of the STAR strategy provides plenty of context, highlights your skills, provides real-world examples, offers hard data about what you accomplished, and gives the employer confidence you’ll add value in a new role.\nA STAR method resume is powerful and overlaps with another popular framework: the CAR method resume, which stands for challenge, action, and result.\nThe biggest difference from the STAR method is that the CAR method provides less context and background about your contribution and instead focuses on a specific problem or challenge you faced.\n‍\nHow to use the STAR method on your resume\nWondering how to apply this method on your own resume? To create a STAR method resume, you’ll focus on two specific sections during your resume writing process:\nWork experience\nProfessional summary\nHere’s a closer look at how to use the STAR method in both sections and give potential employers the level of detail they’re looking for on your resume.\n‍\nHow to use the STAR method in your work experience\nWhen you’re ready to write your work history bullets and resume accomplishments, here are the steps to take to craft your STAR method bullet points: \n‍\n1. List your previous responsibilities\nStart by choosing one of your past jobs to focus on and write a list of all of the things—tasks, responsibilities, solutions, recognition, achievements, and more—you did while you were in that role. This doesn’t need to be a polished list. Your goal is to get everything down on paper.\nIf you're struggling to remember what you did in a past role, look back at resources like:\nYour LinkedIn profile\nLinkedIn recommendations\nPerformance reviews\nMeeting notes and summaries\nEmails \nThose provide a solid refresher on what you were responsible for. Knowing how to write achievements on a resume is as much about thoughtful reflection as it is about the actual writing.\n‍\n2. Compare your list to the job description\nYou’ve likely heard this career advice before: the best way to make sure your resume stands out to recruiters and hiring managers is to confirm it’s a solid match with the job description.\nThe point of your resume isn’t to present you as qualified—it’s to present you as qualified for that specific role. It’s your resume’s job to draw parallels between the position’s requirements and your capabilities, rather than leaving the potential employer to connect the dots. \nReturn to the job posting and look for relevant skills, qualifications, and traits that get a lot of emphasis. Compare those to the list you created in step one, spot the areas of overlap, and highlight the responsibilities you need to include in your document.\nMatching Mode in Teal’s Resume Builder can help. Attach a job description to your resume and Teal will suggest top keywords and skills that should appear on your resume.\nAdd Keywords to Your Resume\n‍\n‍\n3. Describe the situation\nUsing the STAR method you can now craft your first STAR bullet point. Choose one specific responsibility or achievement to focus on first—that’s less overwhelming than working through multiple bullet points or talking points.\nAsk yourself: What was happening in my organization or on my team when I did this? Was your company going through a rebrand? An acquisition? Were you in the thick of a new product launch? Or planning a big event? Or was there a major strategy shift?\n\nYou don’t need to get into the nitty-gritty details. Rather, you just need to give a bit of background so the hiring manager can get the bigger picture.\nSituation example\nOur organization was grappling with declining sales in a key market. \n‍\n4. Determine your task\nOf the four elements in the STAR method, task and action are the two most easily confused. But there is a difference between the two:\nTask: The responsibility or objective you were assigned.\nAction: The specific steps you took to fulfill your responsibility or achieve the objective.\nNow, still looking at that single responsibility, ask yourself: What was my role in that situation? What was my obligation to the company? \nOn a STAR method resume, most of your assigned tasks will be implied with your job title—it’s not something you need to explicitly spell out in every bullet point.\nTask example\nAs a senior sales representative, I was tasked with revitalizing sales and meeting my quarterly targets.\n‍\n5. Highlight your action\nNow it’s time to go beyond the high-level description of what you were supposed to do and describe the details of the actions you took. \nAsk yourself: What specific steps did I take to fulfill my responsibility to my company? \nThe more specific you can get here, the better. Recruiters don’t just want to see buzzwords—they want powerful action verbs and tangible examples.\nAction example\nDeveloped a targeted sales strategy, revamped my sales pitch, and conducted personalized outreach to high-potential clients.\n‍\n6. Define and quantify your results\nWhat’s the most important piece of the STAR resume format? The results. This is when you provide proof that you didn’t just do work—you did work that made a meaningful difference and added real value for your employer.\nLook at your action and ask: What happened? What results did I achieve?\n\nWherever you can, quantify your results with real numbers for extra impact. But that doesn’t mean every single STAR bullet point needs to include a hard digit. From forging strong relationships to streamlining processes, there are plenty of results you can include that aren’t strictly metric-driven.\nResults example\nIncreased regional sales by 40% and exceeded quarterly targets by 15%.\n‍\n7. Pull it all together\nYou’ve laid the groundwork and now you’re ready to pull it all together into an impressive STAR bullet point.\nWhile you want to subtly incorporate all four elements of the STAR method, you don’t need to use them in their exact order every time. Here are a few different approaches you can use to mix things up and keep your bullet points engaging:\n[Situation] [task] [action] [result]\n[Task] [action] [situation] [result]\n[Action] [task] [result] [situation]\n[Result] [task] [action] [situation]\nStarting with action verbs is important regardless of which order you opt for, as they demonstrate ownership over your work and stand out to recruiters. Here’s a look at how the same single bullet point could take shape using those different approaches.\nSTAR bullet point examples\n[Situation] [task] [action] [result]: Overhauled declining sales in a key market region by developing a targeted sales strategy, revamping the sales pitch, and conducting personalized outreach to high-potential clients, resulting in a 40% increase in regional sales and exceeding quarterly targets by 15%.\n[Task] [action] [situation] [result]: Developed a targeted sales strategy, revamped the sales pitch, and conducted personalized outreach to high-potential clients to revitalize sales in a declining market region, resulting in a 40% increase in regional sales and exceeding quarterly targets by 15%.\n[Action] [task] [result] [situation]: Developed a targeted sales strategy, revamped the sales pitch, and conducted personalized outreach to high-potential clients, achieving a 40% increase in regional sales, exceeding quarterly targets by 15%, and revitalizing sales in a declining market.\n[Result] [task] [action] [situation]: Achieved a 40% increase in regional sales and exceeded quarterly targets by 15% by developing a targeted sales strategy, revamping the sales pitch, and conducting personalized outreach to high-potential clients, leading to revitalization of sales in a previously declining market region.\nIt’s a lot of work for a single bullet, especially when you have plenty more resume bullet points to work through. But it’s well worth the extra effort to help your resume stand out.\nYou can make this process a little easier on yourself with the AI resume achievements in Teal’s AI Resume Builder. Click “add an achievement” and then “write with AI” and Teal will automatically write  three bullet point options for you to tweak and include on your resume.\nWrite a Resume with AI\n‍\n\n‍\nWondering how many bullet points to include with each job? It depends on the recency and relevance of the position. You can use five to seven bullet points for more recent and related jobs, and fewer (around three to four) for older positions. \n‍\nSTAR method resume examples for your work history\nSoftware engineer STAR method resume bullet point:\nLed the development of a new feature for the company’s flagship product, which involved collaborating with cross-functional teams to gather requirements and implementing the feature using Agile methodologies, resulting in a 20% increase in user engagement and positive feedback from key clients.\nSituation: The company’s flagship product needed a new feature to increase user engagement and meet client demands.\nTask: Tasked with leading the development of the new feature, ensuring it was delivered on time and met all requirements.\nAction: Collaborated with cross-functional teams to gather requirements, designed the feature, and implemented it using Agile methodologies. Conducted regular code reviews and testing to ensure high quality.\nResult: Successfully delivered the new feature, resulting in a 20% increase in user engagement and positive feedback from key clients.\nHuman resources generalist STAR method resume bullet point:\nDesigned and implemented a comprehensive employee wellness program, collaborating with various departments to identify key needs and organize wellness activities, resulting in a 15% reduction in employee absenteeism and improved overall employee satisfaction.\nSituation: The company was experiencing high employee absenteeism and low overall employee satisfaction.\nTask: Tasked with creating and implementing an employee wellness program to address these issues and improve employee well-being.\nAction: Conducted surveys and focus groups to identify key wellness needs, collaborated with various departments to organize wellness activities and resources, and promoted the program through internal communications.\nResult: Successfully launched the wellness program, leading to a 15% reduction in employee absenteeism and improved overall employee satisfaction.\n‍\nHow to use the STAR method in your resume summary\nYour resume summary (often called your professional summary) is an overview of your most relevant skills, experiences, and accomplishments. It goes at the top of your resume just under your headline and it’s another place you can apply the STAR method.\nDoing so works similarly to how you approached your bullet points, except you’ll look holistically at your entire career rather than individual job responsibilities.\nAsk yourself:\nWhat major goals have I achieved?\nWhat big problems or challenges have I solved?\nWhat meaningful responsibilities have I fulfilled?\nWhat achievements are most notable?\nDon’t forget to return to the job description to confirm the highlights you include in your summary aren’t just impressive, but also relevant to the job. \nMatch Your Resume to a JD\n‍\n\n‍\nSTAR method resume example for your resume summary:\nSeasoned content marketing professional with 5+ years of professional history driving significant improvements in digital marketing performance through strategic content initiatives. Experience developing and executing content strategies to address declining audience engagement and implementing data-driven optimizations and marketing techniques, resulting in a 30% increase in website traffic and a 25% boost in lead generation within six months.\nSituation: Previous company (or companies) faced declining audience engagement.\nTask: Tasked with developing and executing a comprehensive content strategy to improve engagement and drive lead generation.\nAction: Implemented data-driven optimizations and marketing techniques.\nResult: Achieved a 30% increase in website traffic and a 25% boost in lead generation within six months.\nWant to skip the legwork? Teal’s Resume Summary Generator can write you a tailored professional summary in a matter of seconds.\n‍\n‍\nHow to create a STAR format resume with AI \nWriting impressive resume bullets and achievements can be time-consuming and a little tedious. Fortunately, technology can streamline the process. \n‍\nHow to write STAR method bullet points with ChatGPT\nYou can use generative AI like ChatGPT to write your resume bullet points, provided you know how to prompt it effectively. Here are the steps to take:\nFind the job description and save it to your Teal Job Tracker with the free Chrome extension to surface hard skills, soft skills, and emphasis words from the posting.\n‍\n\n‍\nCompare those to your own qualifications to narrow down the skills and keywords you most want to include.\nEnter this prompt into ChatGPT: Write a resume bullet for a [TITLE] position that describes impact and uses metrics. Include at least 2 of these keywords: [A, B, C, D, E, F]. [Copy/paste the top 5 hard and/or soft skills highlighted in Teal].\nChatGPT will automatically generate a bullet point for you. Even if you don’t use it in its exact form (it’s always best to tweak and customize AI-generated content), it’s a helpful starting point.\n‍\nHow to write STAR method bullet points with Teal\nYou can do all of the above—analyze the job description, identify important skills and keywords, and auto-generate bullet points—directly within Teal. Here’s how:\nStart your resume in Teal’s Resume Builder, whether you upload an existing resume, import your LinkedIn profile, or start from scratch.\nAttach a job description to your resume by navigating to the “Matching” tab and choosing a job from your Job Tracker or creating a new job.\n‍\n\n‍\nIn your Work Experience section, click “add an achievement” and then “write with AI.”\n‍\n\n‍\nTeal will automatically generate three bullet point options you can edit and add to your resume.\n‍\n\n‍\nClick the “try again” button to prompt AI to generate new bullet points or click the “customize with AI” button to add more keywords or even write a custom prompt.\n‍\n\n‍\nUse Teal to write your standout STAR method resume\nA star resume is exactly what it sounds like: a resume that stands out from other candidates.

Easily create and customize a resume with Teal's resume builder AI.\n‍\nUnderstanding F-pattern and Z-pattern reading\nBefore diving into the specifics of creating scannable resumes, it’s essential to understand the science behind how people read and process information.\nF-pattern and Z-pattern reading are two common ways our eyes naturally move across a page. Understanding these layout scanning patterns can significantly improve your resume’s effectiveness by ensuring key information is strategically placed to catch the reader's attention.\n‍\n‍\nWhat is F-pattern reading?\nF-pattern reading refers to the natural eye movement that resembles the shape of the letter F when scanning a document. The initial element forms the first horizontal reading movement, which helps define the structure of the F-pattern. This pattern typically involves:\nA horizontal movement across the top of the content area.\nA second horizontal movement slightly lower on the page.\nA vertical movement down the left side of the content.\nThis reading pattern is particularly relevant for resumes because it aligns with how recruiters and hiring managers often scan resumes. By structuring your resume to accommodate this natural eye movement, you can ensure your most important information catches the reader’s attention.\n‍\nWhat is Z-pattern reading?\nZ-pattern reading, as the name suggests, follows a path that resembles the letter Z. This pattern typically involves:\nStarting at the top-left corner.\nMoving horizontally to the top-right corner.\nMoving diagonally down to the bottom-left corner.\nFinishing with a horizontal movement to the bottom-right corner.\nZ-pattern reading can be more effective for visually-driven layouts and resumes in creative industries. It’s also particularly useful when you want to guide the reader's eye in a specific sequence or emphasize certain elements of your resume in a deliberate order.\n‍\nThe psychology behind these reading patterns\nEye-tracking studies have consistently shown that people tend to follow F- and Z-patterns when scanning documents, especially online content. This behavior is largely due to natural reading habits and the way people process information quickly.\nUnderstanding these patterns matters for job seekers because it allows you to strategically place your most important information where it's most likely to be seen and remembered. By aligning your resume's layout with these natural reading patterns, you can:\nIncrease the chances of key information being noticed\nImprove the overall readability of your resume\nMake a stronger first impression in the crucial first few seconds\n‍\nHow to create an F-pattern resume\nNow that you understand the psychology behind F-pattern reading, it's time to explore how to create an f-pattern resume that leverages natural eye movement to call attention to relevant information.\n‍\nKey elements of an F-pattern resume\nAn effective F-pattern resume typically includes:\nA strong header with your name and contact information.\nA prominent skills section or summary statement.\nStrategic use of bold text and bullet points.\nLeft-aligned text for easy scanning.\n‍\nStep-by-step guide to crafting an F-pattern resume\nWhen designing a resume that grabs attention and highlights your qualifications, leveraging the F-pattern layout is key. This guide will walk you through creating an F-pattern resume that places your most important information where hiring managers are most likely to see it.\n‍\n1. Start with a clear, bold header\nPlace your name and contact information at the top of the page in a larger font size.\n‍\n\n‍\n2. Place a concise professional summary directly below\nThis is not only best resume practice, it ensures crucial information is in the first horizontal sweep of the F-pattern.\n‍\n‍\n‍\n3. Use left-aligned headings for each section\nThis guides the eye down the left side of the page, following the vertical part of the F.\n‍‍\nF-pattern resume work experience example\n‍\n4. Incorporate bullet points for easy scanning\nUse bullets to highlight key achievements or responsibilities under each job role\n‍\n‍\n5. Use Group key achievements under a bolded header\nThis draws attention to important information within the body of your resume.\nBest practices for F-pattern resume design\nWhen writing an F-pattern resume, be sure to maintain consistent formatting throughout. That means using the same font, size, and style for similar elements to create a cohesive look—and be sure to choose a clean, professional font. Readable fonts include Arial, Calibri, and Helvetica.\nYou also want to use white space effectively—don’t overcrowd your resume. Allow breathing room between sections to improve readability. You can also improve readability by limiting color use.\n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid in F-pattern resumes\nWhen creating an F-pattern resume, don’t overcrowd the left side of the page. While it's important to align with the F-pattern, don't sacrifice clarity for layout.\nAt the same time, don’t leave the bottom right corner of your resume completely blank. While less prominent in the F-pattern, this area shouldn't be wasted.\n‍\nCreating the Z-pattern resume\nWhile the F-pattern is commonly used, the Z-pattern can be an effective alternative for those looking to create a visually engaging resume that draws attention to specific elements. It's especially useful for more visually-oriented industries or roles.\n‍\nKey elements of a Z-pattern resume\nEye-catching header across the top.\nStrategic placement of key information along the Z path, ensuring the scanning pattern quickly delivers essential details to the reader.\nUse of visual elements to guide the eye.\n‍\nStep-by-step guide to crafting an Z-pattern resume\nThis guide will take you through the steps to design a Z-pattern resume, ensuring your most important details leave a lasting impression on potential employers.\n‍\n1. Design a striking header that spans the page width\nThis forms the top line of the Z\n‍‍\n2. Place your most important information in the top left corner\nThis could be a brief professional summary or your most relevant skills.\n‍\n3. Use a diagonal path to guide the eye to key points\nThis can be achieved through strategic placement of headings or visual elements.\n‍\n4. End with a strong call-to-action or contact information in the bottom right\nThis completes the Z-pattern and leaves a lasting impression.\n‍Note: Teal does not recommend this and it’s not considered best practice for a resume.\n‍\nBest practices for Z-pattern resume design\nWhen creating a Z-pattern resume, you can strategically incorporate subtle visual cues like lines or shapes to help guide the eye along the Z-pattern. If appropriate for your industry, you can also use contrasting colors to emphasize key areas and enhance visual cues.\n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid in Z-pattern resumes\nWhile you want to guide the reader’s eye, don’t overuse visual elements that can distract from the content. Keep the focus on your important qualifications and achievements—and don’t neglect information if it doesn’t fit the Z-pattern.\n‍\nCombining F-pattern and Z-pattern techniques\nIn some cases, a hybrid resume format combining elements of both F-pattern and Z-pattern layouts can be highly effective.\n‍\nWhen and how to use both patterns\nYou can use both an F-pattern resume and Z-pattern resume when: \nYou want to highlight different types of information in various ways.\nYour industry values both traditional and creative approaches.\nYou're applying for a role that requires both analytical and creative skills.\nTo seamlessly integrate both patterns, use an F-pattern for the overall structure of your resume. Then, incorporate Z-pattern elements within specific sections to draw attention to key achievements or skills.\nEnsure the transition between patterns feels natural and doesn't disrupt the flow of information.\n‍\nBalancing visual appeal with content\nRemember, while layout is important, content remains king. You want to ensure your resume remains content-focused and still emphasizes your most important qualifications, achievements, and skills.\nUse layout to enhance, not overshadow, your qualifications and achievements.\n‍\nMaking a scannable resume: Beyond F- and Z-patterns\nWhile F- and Z-patterns are powerful tools, there are additional strategies to make your resume more scannable and effective.\n‍\nOptimize for applicant tracking systems (ATS)\nMany companies use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to screen resumes before they reach human eyes. Choosing the right resume format is crucial to ensure your resume is compatible with an ATS system:\nUse standard section headings (e.g., “Work Experience,” “Education”).\nAvoid complex formatting, tables, or graphics that ATS might not read correctly.\nSave your resume in a compatible file format (usually .docx or .pdf).\n‍\nEnhance readability for human recruiters\nOnce your resume goes through the ATS, it needs to impress human recruiters. Structure information in easily digestible chunks, including short paragraphs and bullet points. You can use font sizes, different fonts, or different font styles (like bold or italics) to call out headings, job titles, and company titles.\nFinally, be sure to incorporate enough white space to avoid a cluttered appearance.\n‍\nInclude relevant skills and keywords\nKeywords play a crucial role in both ATS and human scanning. To include the right keywords on your resume, first identify relevant keywords from the job description. These may be in the “responsibilities” section or “qualifications” section. Incorporate these keywords naturally throughout your resume, balancing keyword usage with clear, concise language to avoid \"keyword stuffing.\"\n‍\nScannable resume examples\nLet's look at some practical examples of how these principles can be applied.\n‍\nF-pattern resume example\n‍\nThis format often follows a reverse-chronological order, which helps in clearly presenting your most recent work experiences to recruiters.\n‍\nKey elements that make this F-pattern resume effective:\nStrong header with name and contact information.\nProminent professional summary section at the top.\nLeft-aligned headings guiding the eye down the page.\nBullet points for easy scanning of achievements.\n‍\nZ-pattern resume example\n‍\nKey elements that make this Z-pattern resume effective:\nEye-catching header spanning the page width.\nKey information strategically placed along the Z path.\nVisual elements guiding the eye through the content..\n‍\nCombo F-Z pattern resume template\n‍\nKey elements that make this combined resume effective:\nIt maintains the overall structure of an F-pattern for familiarity.\nZ-pattern elements draw attention to key achievements.\nThe layout is flexible enough to adapt to various industries and roles.\n‍\nMaximizing your job search success with a scannable resume\nCreating an effective scannable resume is an iterative process. Here's how to test, improve, and maximize your success when creating a scannable resume.\n‍\nConduct your own eye-tracking test\nYou don’t need to wait for your resume to go through an ATS or get a recruiter’s eye before you know if you’ve formatted it correctly. Instead, ask a friend or other trusted person to look at your resume for ten to 15 seconds.\nThen, ask them what key information they remember. Was it your professional summary? Your skills? One of your work experiences? Note which areas drew their attention and which were overlooked.\n‍\nA/B test different layouts\nIf you’re still torn between using an F-pattern resume or a Z-pattern resume, create multiple versions of your resume with slight variations. Then, send different versions to similar job applications. \nYou can then track which resume version gets you more responses or interviews.\n‍\nTailor your resume for different applications\nIt’s best to avoid submitting the same resume over and over to every new position you apply to. Instead, adjust your scannable resume for each job application. A functional resume is most useful for job seekers with limited experience, career changers, or those with employment gaps.\nThis means matching your resume to the job description of the specific company and role you’re applying for—ensuring you’re calling out the most relevant experiences, skills, and qualifications.\n‍\nContinuously improve your resume\nNo matter what scannable resume type you choose, you should always regularly update that resume with new achievements and skills. If you learn something new at work, get a certification, or work on a personal project, you should add it to your resume if it’s relevant to the roles you’re applying for.\nIf you find your resume isn’t getting the response you’ve wanted, be willing to adjust—whether the format, content style, or how you’re writing about your achievements.\n‍\nComplement your resume with a strong online presence\nYour job application is more than your resume. Your online presence, including your LinkedIn, should back up what you’ve put on your resume and boost your professional brand. \nAs you’re updating your resume, make a habit of updating your online profiles, too. You can also add resume links to your projects and portfolios that you allude to on your resume.\n‍\nCrafting your path to success with a scannable resume\nCreating a scannable resume using F-pattern and Z-pattern techniques can significantly improve your chances of landing your dream job. By understanding how recruiters and ATS scan resumes, you can strategically place your most important information where it's most likely to be noticed.\nRemember these key points:\nF-pattern resumes and Z-pattern resumes optimize your resume for natural reading patterns.\nA scannable resume increases your chances of optimizing for both human and ATS screenings.\nCombining strategic layout with strong content is crucial for an effective resume.\nContinuously test and refine your resume for best results.\nAs you craft your scannable resume, keep in mind that it's not just about following a template—it's about presenting your unique value proposition in the most effective way possible. Stay informed about industry trends, be open to feedback, and don't be afraid to showcase your personality within the constraints of professional resume design.\nWith these techniques and mindset, you're well-equipped to create a resume that not only passes initial screenings but also leaves a lasting impression on hiring managers.

You'll also learn tips on structuring your resume, maintaining readability, and why a PDF format may be the better option when applying through most Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).\nTrying to create a simple resume with all the right details? Create a resume with Teal for free.\n‍\nWhat is a plain text resume?\nA plain text resume is a simple, unformatted version of your resume that contains only standard characters and line breaks.\nSometimes known as an ASCII resume, its primary purpose is to ensure compatibility with a variety of systems and platforms used in the hiring process. Unlike more traditionally designed resumes, plain text resumes focus solely on content without any fancy fonts, colors, or additional elements.\n‍\nA plain text resume without formatting or design enhancement\n‍\nTeal note: The plain text format above was not created using Teal. While Teal offers simple, ATS-friendly templates and plenty of options without frills or heavy designs, they cannot be saved in a .txt or .rft format in accordance with modern resume best practices. You can, however, save your entire career history in Teal and then pull the most relevant detail for every job you apply for with a plain text resume.\n‍\nWhen to use a plain text resume\nWhile a well-formatted PDF resume is generally the best choice for most job applications, especially because they're parsed easily by most ATS, but there are specific situations where having a plain text version can be beneficial.\nHere are some scenarios where a plain text document might come in handy:\nEmailing your resume directly to recruiters or hiring managers: Some prefer a simple format for quick review\nIncluding your resume in the body of an email: When attachments aren't allowed or might be flagged as spam\nCopying into online application forms: A few platforms (like Workday) or online portals might require you to paste your resume into plain text fields. Having a text-only version handy can save you time and hassle.\nUploading to professional networking sites: Platforms like LinkedIn let you upload multiple resume formats. A plain text version can be a useful backup for these situations.\nPreparing for technical job applications: Some tech companies prefer plain text resumes for certain positions.\n‍\nPros and cons of a plain text resume\nUnderstanding the advantages and disadvantages of using a plain text formatted resume can help you decide when it’s the best option. Here\n‍\nPros of a plain text resume\nCompatibility: Ensures your resume is compatible with all systems and platforms\nSimplicity: Easy to create and update without needing advanced formatting skills\nFocus on content: Emphasizes your skills and experiences without design elements\n‍\nCons of a plain text resume\nLack of visual appeal: May not stand out visually compared to formatted resumes\nLimited formatting: You can't use bold, italics, or other formatting to highlight key information\nPerceived as basic: Might be seen as less professional or polished by some employers\nHard to read: Can be challenging to read at a glance without headings, bullet points, or lines\n‍\nPlain text resume vs PDF resume\nPlain text and PDF resumes each have their uses, but there are important differences in terms of their functionality and presentation. Here's a quick comparison of the two:\n\n‍\nCreate a simple resume\nTeal can help you easily format and optimize your content for ATS compatibility while keeping your skills and experiences as the primary focus without the bells and whistles of intricate design.\nAnd if you're opting for a plain text resume, Teal stores your entire career history—from scratch, an existing resume, or even download resume from LinkedIn—so you're never have to worry about pulling details from multiple files or folders.\n‍\nHow to format a plain text resume\nIf you've decided having your own plain text resume is a good option, here's how to do it:\n‍\nChoose the right file format\nYou have two main file format options for building a resume that's just plain text: .txt and .rtf.\n‍\n.txt (Text File):\nPros: Universal compatibility, smallest file size\nCon: Limited formatting options\n‍\n.rtf (Rich Text Format):\nPros: Allows for some basic formatting, widely compatible\nCons: Slightly larger file size, may not be accepted by all systems\nYour best bet is to choose .txt for maximum compatibility, especially when submitting through online forms or ATS (although a PDF is still a better option here). Use .rtf when you need minimal formatting and are sure the recipient can open it.\n‍\nSet up your document\nUse a simple text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). You can also opt to edit your resume in something like Microsoft Word or Google Docs.\nSet your margins to 1 inch on all sides\nUse a monospaced font like Courier or Consolas, size 12\nLimit each line to 65-70 characters for optimal readability\nUse single spacing between lines and double spacing between sections\n‍\nStructure your content\nOrganize your resume using the guidelines below so it's more scannable and visually appealing. Remember, not only do you want your resume to be parsed by an ATS, but you also want a recruiter or hiring manager to see your value quickly—don't make them work to find it.\n‍To structure your plain text resume:\nUse all caps for resume headings (e.g., WORK EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION)\nCreate visual separation between sections with a line of asterisks or hyphens\nUse simple bullet points (•) or hyphens (-) for lists\nAlign text to the left for consistency\nUse blank lines to create white space between sections\n‍\nSave your resume in a .txt or .rft\nIf you're using a word processing program, here's how you save a plain text file:\nOpen your Microsoft Word document or Google Doc\nClick \"File\" > \"Save As\" in Microsoft Word. For Google Docs, you'll download your resume as a specific .txt or .rft when you're done by clicking \"File\" > \"Download\"\nChoose either \"Plain Text (.txt)\" or \"Rich Text Format (.rtf)\" from the file type options\nIn Microsoft Word, you'll then name your file and click \"Save\"\n‍\nParts of a plain text resume\nA plain text resume should have all of the same elements as a PDF or Word resume. It should also be tailored to the specific job you're applying for (more on that in the next section!).\nThe most important parts of any resume are:\nContact Information\nTarget Title\nProfessional Summary \nWork Experience\nEducation\nCertifications\nSkills\nOptional\n– Projects\n– Awards and Scholarships\n– Volunteering and Leadership\n– Publications\n– Interests\nBuild a Simple Resume\n‍\nPlain text resume best practices\nNow that you know what you need and how to start a plain text resume and what one needs, below are some best practices you should follow when creating one.\n‍\nTailor your content\nTailoring your resume every time you hit apply will help you stand out as qualified for that specific job. In fact, your resume should always be one hundred percent relevant to the position you're applying for. Here's how you do it:\nStep 1: Start by reading the job posting. Take note of any hard skills, soft skills, or language that's repeated often.\nStep 2: Compare the language and keywords you wrote down to those in your resume. What do you have? What's missing?\nStep 3: Strategically incorporate any missing words from the job description into your resume.\nStep 4: Save this new version as a separate file.\nStep 5: Repeat this process for each application\n‍\nPro Tip: Want to tailor your plain text resume faster? Plug your existing resume into Teal's Resume Builder. Then, attach a job description to see how your experience and skills align with that specific job. Teal gives you a Match Score that shows you just how well you stack up and offers suggestions for improvement.\nCompare Your Resume With a Job\n‍\n‍\nOptimize for job boards\nWhen submitting your plain-text resume to a job board, it’s important to make sure it meets the specific requirements of the platforms. Some things you should be mindful of:\nFile size: Ensure your resume is under 100 KB for easy uploading and quick access\nFile name: Name your resume file descriptively, such as \"John_Doe_Marketing_Resume.txt\"\nCharacter limits: Be aware of any character limits set by the job board and adjust your content\n‍\nCraft an email-friendly version\nFor email applications, a well-structured plain text resume can make the difference between standing out or getting lost in an inbox. Here’s how to ensure your resume is effective and professional:\nUse a subject line like \"Marketing Manager Application - John Doe\" to clearly indicate the purpose of your email.\nKeep your message brief and professional, directly addressing the recipient.\nPaste your resume directly into the email after your message, ensuring it's easy for the recipient to read without opening an attachment.\nSend a test email to yourself to check the formatting and ensure everything appears as intended.\n‍\nKeep your details in one place\nJuggling multiple resume versions can be a headache. Rather than toggling between programs or platforms, use the Teal Resume Builder as a central hub for your career info. Whether you need the occasional plain text version or a PDF, having everything in one place streamlines building your resume—however you choose to do it.\nSave Your Entire Career History\n‍\nMaking your plain text resume stand out\nJust because you're opting for a plain text resume format doesn't mean you don't want your skills and experience to stand out. Here are a few simple techniques to make your resume more organized, easier to navigate, and a bit more unique.\n‍\nUse strategic capitalization and spacing\nBoost the readability of your document by using capitalization and spacing strategically.\nALL CAPS for headers\nCapitalize key elements\nUse blank lines\nAlign dates to the right\nUse consistent spacing\n‍\nIncorporating ASCII characters\nYou can also add visual interest to your plain-text resume with ASCII characters. These elements can help break up text and draw attention to key areas:\nUse asterisks (*) or equal signs (=) to create clear section dividers\nOpt for hyphens (-) to organize lists and make them easier to read\nUse vertical bars (|) to separate items on the same line, adding clarity\nCreate simple boxes with plus signs (+) and hyphens (-) for emphasis on specific sections\nUse carets (^) or tildes (~) to draw attention to important information\nExample:\n--------\nSKILLS\n--------\nDigital Marketing | SEO | Google Analytics\n‍\nPlain text resume mistakes to avoid\nTo maximize the impact of your plain-text resume, it’s crucial to avoid common mistakes that can undermine your efforts. Here are key areas to watch out for and how to handle them effectively.\n‍\nFormatting errors\nFormatting mistakes can make your resume difficult to read and appear unprofessional. Steer clear of these common formatting mistakes:\nAvoid using the tab key or multiple spaces for alignment:\nRefrain from including special characters\nTest your resume in different text editors\nMaintain consistent spacing and alignment\nStick to the recommended line length\n‍\nContent overload\nRecruiters and hiring managers can be overwhelmed by too much information. It’s essential to present a clear and concise resume:\nLimit your resume to 1-3 pages: Keep it concise and focused on your most relevant experiences.\nHighlight recent and relevant experiences: Focus on the most current and applicable experiences for the job.\nUse concise language: Avoid fluff and unnecessary details that don't add value.\nPrioritize achievements: Emphasize your accomplishments and impact over day-to-day responsibilities.\nRemove outdated or irrelevant information: Keep your resume current and relevant to the job you’re applying for.\n‍\nLack of customization\nNo two jobs are the same, and neither should your resumes be. Tailoring your resume to each role is crucial for standing out as a qualified candidate:\nEach role you apply for has specific skills and experiences that are relevant. Customize your resume to speak directly to these requirements, showcasing how your background aligns with the job's needs.\n‍\nPlain text resume template and example\nHaving examples and templates can simplify the process of creating a resume from scratch.\n‍\nPlain text resume template\n‍\n[Your Name]\n[City, State]\n[Phone Number] | [Email Address]\n[LinkedIn Profile URL]\n[Optional Portfolio URL]\n‍\n[TARGET TITLE]\n‍\nPROFESSIONAL SUMMARY\n[2-3 sentences highlighting your key qualifications, including years of experience, 2-3 hard skills, and your most notable achievements]\n‍\nWORK EXPERIENCE\n[Job Title] | [Company Name] | [Location] | [Employment Dates]\n- [Achievement with metrics and impact]\n- [Achievement with metrics and impact]\n- [Achievement with metrics and impact]\n‍\n‍\n[Job Title] | [Company Name] | [Location] | [Employment Dates]\n- [Achievement with metrics and impact]\n- [Achievement with metrics and impact]\n- [Achievement with metrics and impact]\n‍\nEDUCATION\n[Degree] in [Field of Study] | [University Name] | [Graduation Date]\n- [Relevant coursework or achievements if you're a recent graduate]\n‍\nSKILLS\n[Skill Category]: [List of skills]\n[Skill Category]: [List of skills]\n[Skill Category]: [List of skills]\n‍\nCERTIFICATIONS\n- [Relevant certification name] [Organization] ([Year])\n- [Relevant certification name] [Organization] ([Year])\n‍\nSample plain text resume\nA plain text resume example to help guide your process\n‍\nTesting your plain text resume\nTo make sure your document is both functional and visually appealing, test and refine it across platforms and devices.\nOpen in various text editors:\nTest your resume in multiple text editors like Notepad, TextEdit, and Sublime Text to ensure it displays correctly across different platforms.\nSend it to yourself using different email clients:\nUse email clients like Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail to send your resume to yourself.

Ensure your resume is compatible with Workday ATS for better job application success.","Content":"3 key takeaways\nWorkday is one of the most adopted applicant tracking systems (ATS).\nThere are best practices to create an ATS-friendly resume.\nUse the AI Resume Builder to make a resume that's ATS-friendly.\nApplicant tracking systems (ATS) are a common part of online job applications, and Workday is one of the most frequently adopted applicant tracking systems and talent management systems.\nIf you’re not already familiar, an ATS is like a digital filing cabinet that employers can use for human resource management and job applicant organization.\n‍\n\n‍\nUnfortunately for job seekers, Workday has issues with resume parsing, which often means manually inputting information multiple times and requiring users to create a new account for every job application they submit.\nFor these and other similar reasons, Workday users took to Reddit to voice their dissatisfaction.\n‍\n\n‍\n\n‍\nIt can be challenging to create a resume Workday can properly read. Fancy graphics and complicated designs aren’t compatible with Workday, so you need a clean but professional resume. That’s where Teal comes in.\nWith Teal’s AI-powered Resume Builder, you can create an ATS-friendly resume that shows off your skills and works as smoothly as possible with Workday. This post will explore how to create a Workday resume, how to upload and find it within Workday, and common mistakes to avoid.\nStruggling to create a parsable resume? Build a resume that get's scanned correctly with Teal.\n‍\nHow to format a parsable Workday resume\nDespite Workday’s quirks, so many companies use it as their ATS that you would be limiting your options in the job search if you weren’t using it properly. Some larger enterprises like Workday because it has advanced features, like an enterprise interface builder that lets them manage large amounts of company data.\nFor job seekers, the good news is that if you can create an ATS-friendly resume for Workday, it will very likely be compatible with just another any other ATS on the market.\nHere’s a step-by-step guide to creating an ATS-friendly resume for Workday:\n‍\nStep 1: Keep it simple\nOpt for a text-based resume format with clear headings and bullet points. Refrain from using fancy fonts, tables, or graphics that the ATS could misinterpret. Think of how a computer might read your resume, and keep it as simple as possible.\nNote: If you are applying to creative or design roles, you may want to have two copies of your resume—one simple version to upload to job applications and one “designed” version to share in an in-person interview.\n‍\nStep 2: Use standard formatting\nMaintain consistent and straightforward formatting throughout your resume. Use standard section headings like Work Experience, Education, and Skills to guide the ATS through your qualifications and match up with what Workday expects, making it easier to parse the information.\nTo get started, choose from Teal's library of ATS-friendly resume templates. Next, Teal provides standard resume sections like Work Experience, Education, etc that you can rename and reorder. You can even tweak the formatting and style of the resume, all while remaining ATS-friendly.\nChoose an ATS-Friendly Resume Template\n‍\n‍\nStep 3: Add keywords\nBefore creating your resume, take the time to thoroughly analyze the job description. Identify the key skills, experiences, and qualifications the employer wants. Once you have a good understanding, you’ll want to sprinkle relevant keywords from the job description throughout your resume.\n‍\n‍\nStep 4: Focus on the content\nNext to having clear formatting and using keywords, the most important part of an ATS-friendly resume is the actual content. From the professional summary to the bullet points, this content is valuable real estate to show off the impact you’ve made at previous organizations and position yourself as the perfect fit for the role.\nWhenever possible, quantify your achievements with numbers and metrics, and use strong action verbs to describe your achievements and responsibilities in previous roles.\nThese best practices not only highlight the impact you made but also create a more compelling resume for the recruiter or hiring manager reading your resume. Don’t get so focused on optimizing for ATS that you forget that humans will also be reading your resume.\nNot sure if your resume is hitting the mark? The easiest way to check is with Teal’s Analysis Score, which instantly gives you feedback on how you’re following resume best practices.\n‍\n‍\nPro tip: Inside the Analysis section of the Resume Builder, you can get a Resume Score that gives you suggestions for what to improve about your resume plus what keywords you might be missing that match up with the job description.\n‍\nThe importance of including the right keywords in a Workday resume\nApplicant tracking systems like Workday rely on keywords to help file and sort candidates for a job posting. A hiring manager or recruiter can then run a search in the ATS for certain keywords as a way to filter through applicant resumes faster.\nWhile they still have the option to manually read each resume (and some companies do!), if a job genuinely requires certain skills, it makes sense to prioritize reviewing candidates who have demonstrated experience with those skills. For applicants, that means using the right keywords in your resume.\nThankfully, Teal makes it easy to optimize a Workday resume for applicant tracking systems.\n\n‍\nIn particular, Teal’s Match Score can help you meet ATS keyword criteria. After attaching a job description to a resume in Teal, you’ll see a list of keywords, including hard skills and soft skills, that you should add to your resume based on what the AI determines are the most important skills and industry terms from the job description.\n‍\nWorkday resume templates\nInstead of downloading a random resume template online or making something from scratch, using a proven ATS resume template means your resume will be more likely to pass the initial screening. Plus, these templates are naturally easy for both computers and humans to read because they’re simple and clean.\nHow do you choose the right Workday resume template? Teal has more than a dozen Workday-compatible templates within the Resume Builder. Pick one that matches your style and then customize it with colors, spacing, and fonts of your choosing.\n‍\n\n‍\nHow to upload your resume to Workday\nUploading a resume to Workday is simple in theory, but depending on how a company has configured the software, it can either be a straightforward process or require several steps to make sure the information is properly parsed.\nIn a typical Workday job application, you upload your resume and the system will try to parse the information to fill out the application, including your work experience, education, skills, and more. In practice, some of the information Workday extracts from your resume may not be fully accurate and might need to be edited or corrected.\n‍\nHere’s how to upload a resume to Workday:\n1. First, find a job you want to apply for at a company using a Workday system (you can tell because the application will be on a Workday website domain.\n‍\n‍\n2. Next, click the Apply button and then click on Autofill with Resume. You’ll need to sign in to your account or create a new one.\n‍\n\n‍\n3. Upload your best resume by selecting the file from your computer in a DOC, DOCX, HTML, PDF, or TXT file type (PDF and DOCX are the most common resume formats).\n‍\n\n‍\n4. Workday will now try to parse the information from your resume.\nCheck over the My Information screen and fill in any gaps or mistakes. Click Save and Continue when you’re done.\n5. The next screen will be My Experience, which tends to be the area that requires the most tweaking. You may need to manually correct or add information in this section.\n‍\n\n‍\nAfter you make the corrections and fill out the rest of the job application, you can save and submit.\n‍\nHow to find your resume in Workday\nIf you’ve already uploaded a resume in Workday, you can find it in your account by following these steps:\n1. First, log in to your Workday account with a specific company (every company has a different Workday login)\n2. Make sure you’re on the Candidate Home screen, then scroll down to My Applications and click on one of your job applications.\n‍\n\n‍\n3. Next click on the \"Continue Application\" button, then save and continue until you get to the My Experience section.\n‍\n\n‍\n4. From here, you can see the resumes you’ve previously uploaded. Although you aren’t able to download them, you can delete them or upload a new one on this screen.\n‍\n\n‍\n5. Depending on how the company configured the software, you can also edit your work experience here (some companies only ask for a resume upload on Workday).\n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid when creating a Workday resume\nThere are a few mistakes you want to avoid when making or uploading a Workday resume.\nMistake #1: Missing keywords\nMany job seekers overlook the importance of incorporating relevant keywords from the job description. Try to include more keywords and skills on your resume.\nAdd Keywords To Your Resume\n‍\n\n‍\nMistake #2: Using graphics or pictures\nFancy photos, pie charts, and graphics might look visually appealing, but they can wreak havoc on the ATS parsing process. Good rule of thumb? Keep your resume minimalistic.\nMistake #3: The wrong file type\nThe most common resume file types are PDF and DOCX, which Workday supports. Make sure you are using a standard resume format that will work well with Workday.\nYou can avoid these costly mistakes by using Teal’s Resume Builder. With Matching Mode, you get suggestions for what keywords to add to your resume. Teal’s resume templates are all simple and ATS-friendly. Plus, unlike many other resume builders, you can export all Teal resumes as standard PDF or DOCX files for free.\n‍\nMake Workday work for you\nWith a well-crafted Workday resume and a little tweaking, you can fill out job applications in Workday faster and more easily. The parsing works better with an ATS-optimized resume, so it’s worth the initial effort to create a better resume.\nTeal's AI-powered Resume Builder helps you create Workday resumes that are both ATS-friendly and show off your background and experience in the best light.\nIf you ever get stuck, the Basic and Advanced Guidance feature guides you step-by-step through crafting the perfect achievements for your work experience section, writing a professional summary, adding skills, and more.\nIt’s free to get started with Teal.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow can you update a resume in Workday?\nHow can you make a parsable resume for Workday?\nHow can you show you used Workday on a resume?","URL Slug":"create-parsable-workday-resume-template"}}]}

They align your specific qualifications with the job you're applying for. Understanding how to extract and incorporate them effectively is the difference between a generic resume and one tailored for job search success.\n‍\n‍\nThe importance of keywords in job descriptions\nKeywords aren't just resume buzzwords. They're actually an important part of the modern hiring process. \nKeywords are the hard skills and soft skills hiring managers, recruiters, and prospective employers are looking for in a job candidate. Incorporating keywords in a job description emphasizes the specific responsibilities, qualifications, and expectations required in a particular role.  \nFor example, keywords might highlight technical knowledge of tools like:\nPython\nAirTable\nSurfer\nThey can also point to soft skills like:\nCritical thinking\nAdaptability\nCommunication\n‍\nIt's also important to understand that the keywords vary from job to job. Just like the job duties and responsibilities are different for a project manager and a front-end developer, the required skills within a job listing will be different, too. \n‍\nHow hiring professionals use job description keywords\nOnce the hiring manager or recruiter is ready to review the pool of applicants, they use those same job description keywords to identify the most qualified candidates. \n‍\nIf a company uses applicant tracking software (ATS)—a digital filing system—team members can input the most important qualifications (as keywords) they're looking for in a candidate, and the ATS pulls the resumes that align. \nFor example, suppose a company is looking for a project manager with experience in SaaS. In that case, a member of the hiring team might input keywords like \"SaaS,\" \"project management,\" \"Agile,\" and \"stakeholder communication\" into their applicant tracking system.\n\nOnly after they input those keywords would the ATS pull those resumes that include these terms—ensuring that candidates with these particular skills and experiences are visible to the hiring team.\nThis means, for job seekers like you, recognizing and integrating relevant keywords into your resume isn't just an added advantage—it's vital. When you optimize your resume with the right keywords, you significantly increase the likelihood of a hiring professional considering your application.\n‍\nFinding keywords in job descriptions: A step-by-step guide\nIn today's market, top candidates know how to find keywords in job descriptions and align their resumes accordingly.\nTailoring your resume to each specific role you apply for is the key to standing out to hiring managers as a prime candidate.\n‍\nA job description outlines the specific responsibilities of the position. Prospective employers review your resume to see if it matches these criteria. A tailored resume showcases the top 10% of your experience that's 100% relevant to the role you're applying for. Understanding how to identify keywords in a job description and then incorporating them into your resume increases your chances of standing out and progressing to the job interview stage. \nUse job descriptions to identify exactly what a company is looking for.\n‍\nStep 1: Read the entire job description\nTo effectively extract keywords from a job description, start by reading the entire job posting to understand the role's responsibilities and requirements.\nThis might also offer insight into the company, benefits, and overall culture—helping you determine whether or not this position would be a good fit. \n‍\nStep 2. Highlight action verbs\nIdentify action verbs that describe responsibilities. Words like \"manage,\" \"coordinate,\" \"develop,\" or \"design.\"\n(Check out this extensive library of resume synonyms to find the right verbs, phrases to best articulate your experiences.)\n‍\nStep 3: Spot technical skills and jargon\nFor jobs requiring specific tech knowledge, industry-specific terms, tools, or software will likely be mentioned—e.g., \"Python,\" \"SEO optimization,\" \"financial forecasting,\" etc.\n‍\nStep 4: Identify soft skills\nLook for descriptors that pertain to interpersonal or organizational abilities, like \"team player,\" \"leadership,\" \"excellent communication,\" or \"problem-solving.\"\n‍\nStep 5: Focus on qualifications and certifications\nNote any specific degrees, licenses, or certifications mentioned, such as \"MBA required,\" \"Certified Public Accountant,\" or \"PMP certification.\"\n‍\nStep 5: List repeated terms\nIf a word or skill is mentioned multiple times throughout the description, it's likely a crucial requirement for the role.\n‍\nStep 6: Use keyword identification tools like Teal\nTeal's resume builder is designed to help you identify key words in a job description, saving you time and ensuring you don't miss important terms that hiring managers are looking for.\n‍\nFind job description keywords with Teal\nBefore you start combing through job descriptions to find the right keywords, there's a faster, more seamless way.\nThe Teal Resume Builder and Job Application Tracker act as a job description keyword finder—pulling the top keywords from every position you save in just one click so you can skip the steps.\nSign Up, It's Free\n‍\n\n‍\nHow to find keywords in a job description\n‍\n1. Analyze Multiple Job Descriptions\nExamine multiple job descriptions for similar roles to get a holistic understanding of an industry's needs. Then, create a master list of keywords from the various job ads you've analyzed. The ones consistently mentioned are primary keywords you should consider including in your applications.\n‍\n2. Focus on context\nEvery job description is tailored to specific needs and requirements for a role. It's vital to interpret the overall context to discern which keywords are most relevant. \nFor example, A job description for a \"Software Engineer\" at a game development company might emphasize \"game engine experience.\" Where a \"Software Engineer\" at a financial institution might prioritize \"secure coding.\"\n‍\n3. Avoid general terms\nWhile many job postings might use broad terms (like team player or proactive) to describe desired qualities, these are often too vague to set one candidate apart from another.\n‍\n4. Use synonyms\nJob descriptions might have a primary keyword, but using related terms or synonyms can also be beneficial. Using a variety of resume phrases that relate to a central skill or requirement can show depth and versatility in that area.\n\nIncorporating keywords into your resume\nWhen you've identified the relevant keywords from a job description, the next step is seamlessly integrating them into your resume. \nHere's how you can do that:\n‍\nStrategically place keywords throughout various resume sections\nStarting with your target job title and professional resume summary, introduce some of the more frequently used keywords from the job description. As these sections sit at the top of your resume, they're one of the first things hiring professionals see. \nAfter that, continue incorporating keywords as skills and other important language in your \"Work Experience,\" \"Education,\" \"Certifications,\" \"Skills\" sections, and more.\n‍\nQuantify using metrics alongside keywords\nRather than just listing skills, use them in context. Numbers like KPIs, metrics, and data showcase impact. Including them alongside specific keywords highlights how you achieved that impact.\n‍\nLet's take a look at some examples.\n\"Managed a team of 10 and used Agile methodologies to accelerate project completion by 20%.\"\n\"Resolved 100+ customer complaints weekly, achieving a 95% customer satisfaction rate.\nImplemented a new CRM software system that reduced response time by 25% and increased team productivity by 15%.\"\n\"Facilitated bi-weekly team communication workshops, improving cross-functional collaboration and boosting overall morale by 20%.\"\n‍\nThe importance of using keywords naturally and in context\nWhile integrating resume keywords to create a targeted resume is important, ensuring they flow naturally within your content is equally important. Keyword stuffing might not be visible to software like applicant tracking systems (ATS), but it will be evident to most hiring professionals. \nAlso, it's not enough to include the keyword; demonstrating how you applied it to have an impact is the key to successful incorporation. \n‍\nHow to use Teal to find keywords in job descriptions\nTo save time and effort in identifying job description keywords, the Teal Job Application Tracker and AI Resume Builder can streamline the process.

Employers use it to determine if your background is a match and whether you should move forward to the interviews. \n\nIt seems like an impossibly big job for a single piece of paper. But a CAR method resume can help. It’s an acronym that stands for challenge, action, result and is a framework you can use to build your most impressive resume. This guide covers:\n\nWhat the CAR method is and how it works\nHow to use the CAR method on your resume\nA tool to easily apply the CAR method in your resume\n‍\n\nNeed a resume that shows off your most impressive accomplishments? Try Teal's free Resume Builder to create a CAR method resume today.\n\n‍\n\nWhat is the CAR method?\nWhether you’re creating a functional resume, a reverse chronological order resume, or any other format, the typical approach is to simply state your relevant information like your work history, education, and notable accomplishments.\n\n\nThe CAR method pushes beyond that. Rather than highlighting duties, this framework focuses on impact by looking at three key pieces:\n\nChallenge: What was the problem you needed to solve or the goal you needed to accomplish?\nAction: What steps did you take to address that problem or goal?\nResult: What happened as a result of the action you took?\nThis helps you dig deeper into your past experiences so you can go beyond sharing what you did and emphasize why it mattered.\n\n‍\n\nWhat is the CAR method resume?\nWhile a typical resume might share a laundry list of tasks, bullets, and skills, a CAR method resume emphasizes the relevant ideas, solutions, and results you offered previous employers. \n\nFor example, a typical approach to your job history section might look something like this: \n\nMarketing Coordinator | Feb 2021 - Jan 2024\nPied Piper| New York, NY\n\nPlanned, wrote, and distributed weekly newsletters\nManaged company Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn accounts\nCoordinated company events\nCollaborated closely with sales and customer support teams\nWhile this approach to your work experience explains what you did in that role, it’s not compelling. There are no details, examples, or quantifiable results to capture the attention of recruiters. \n\nHere’s a look at similar responsibilities after applying the CAR method:\n\nMarketing Coordinator | Feb 2021 - Jan 2024\nPied Piper| New York, NY\n\nDeveloped and executed a weekly newsletter strategy that reengaged inactive subscribers, improved email open rate by 28%, and added 1,600 new subscribers within one quarter\nCreated a detailed social media plan that led to a 20% increase in click-through rates across Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn and doubled audience size within six months\nBolstered company brand and reputation by coordinating and hosting strategic company events, including an annual user conference attended by more than 1,200 customers and industry partners\nCollaborated closely with sales and customer support teams to overhaul and improve the demo experience and increase sales and conversions by 18% within three months\nIt’s not hard to see the difference. While the first one explains what you did, the second specifically spells out the challenges you addressed, the responsibilities you took on, and the impact you made. \n\nIn short, it better answers the question every recruiter or hiring manager has when reviewing applications: Does this person have what it takes to succeed in this job?\n\n‍\n\nHow to use the CAR method on your resume\nResumes are full of sentence fragments and bullet points, which makes it challenging to explain your career and qualifications in a way that’s clear and engaging for the reader. The CAR method helps you hit the most important points, without getting too long-winded or bogged down in details.\n\nAnd while it might feel rigid, it can be applied to your document in a number of ways. For example, you could use the framework to reflect on your entire career, a single position, or even a specific project or bullet point. \n\nWith that said, there are two sections of your resume where it’ll be the most applicable:\n\nYour work experience\nYour professional summary\nThose are two areas where you’re already focusing on what you’ve done or achieved, so they’re the most obvious places to work through the acronym. Here’s a closer look at how to use the framework to tell a story about your skills, experience, and accomplishments.\n\n‍\n\nHow to use the CAR method in your work experience\nThe bulk of your resume is dedicated to listing your past positions and listing out your primary responsibilities and notable accomplishments. In most roles, you likely faced challenges that required solutions—making this a perfect place to use the CAR method to your advantage.\n\nThe framework matters but, even more importantly, you need to focus on relevance. You might have  impressive skills, accolades, and training under your belt. But if they’re unrelated to the position you’re applying for, they won’t pique a hiring manager’s interest. Be willing to cut them as needed when tailoring your resume for a role.\n\nBefore you get started on listing out your own qualifications, take a fine-tooth comb to the job description and make note of any skills, qualities, or responsibilities that get a lot of emphasis.\n\n‍\n\nHow to tailor your bullet points using the CAR method\nWhen you’re ready to start hashing out your work experience bullet points, here are the steps to take:\n\n‍\n\n1. Create a list of your responsibilities and accomplishments\n\nPick one of your previous positions to focus on and start by writing a list of the major things—any task, solution, recognition, accomplishment, or more—you handled or achieved while in that role.\n\nThere doesn’t need to be any order or detail to this yet. Your main goal is to generate a large list of everything related to that previous position.\n\nTake your time with this and revisit resources like: \n\nEmails\nYour LinkedIn profile\nPerformance reviews\nMeeting notes\nThose will help you reflect on your experience. You want to create a comprehensive list as it’ll make the next steps easier. \n\n‍\n\n2. Compare to the job description\n\nNow you’re ready to narrow down that list, using the job description as your guide. Return to the job posting and compare it with the list you created, connecting the dots between the employer’s requests and your qualifications.\n\nAdd to Chrome\n‍\n\n‍\n\nHighlight the ones that have significant overlap. Those are of particular interest to the company, so they belong on your document. \n\nMatching Mode in Teal's resume maker is helpful for this prep work. Attach a job description to your resume and Teal will suggest keywords and skills that are worth including in your own document. \n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n3. Identify the challenge\n\nWhen you’ve identified your most strongly related qualifications, you’re ready to use the CAR framework to go beyond the simple task and understand the context of each.\n\nSelect one of your duties or responsibilities and ask yourself this question: What challenge did this solve? Every single one of your tasks likely met a need or solved a problem, and that’s what you’re trying to identify in this step.\n\nResume challenge example:\n\nMaybe in a previous position at an agency, you were responsible for generating and sending monthly website analytics reports to your clients. Why was that important? Because it improved visibility into the work the agency was doing and reinforced the value of your services.\n\nYou might not explicitly state the related challenge with every single one of your bullet points. However, it's a helpful high-level perspective to keep in mind as you illustrate the impact and importance of your work. \n\n‍\n\n4. Determine your action \n\nIn this step, you answer this question: What did you do? Did you come up with a more repeatable process for sending reports? Did you automate parts of the workflow? Did you create a portal where clients could access their metrics at any time?\n\nTake some time to think through how you contributed to solving a problem or achieving a goal. Employers don’t only want to know what happened—they want to know the specific role you played.\n\n‍\n\n5. Define and quantify your results\n\nYou know what you did and why it mattered. The final piece of the puzzle involves answering this question: What happened? What were the results of that action? What did you achieve?\n\nYou want to quantify your results wherever you can by attaching real numbers. But for responsibilities where you don’t have access to related outcomes, you can still emphasise your impact by highlighting other meaningful results for the business.\n\nFor example, in that same role with an agency, emphasising your results within a bullet point could look like this:\n\nDeveloped and implemented a targeted digital marketing campaign for a client in the consumer goods industry, resulting in a 30% increase in website traffic, a 25% boost in online sales, and a 20% rise in social media engagement within a three-month period.\nOr it could look like this:\n\nCollaborated with cross-functional teams to develop and execute integrated marketing strategies that enhanced brand storytelling and resonated with the target audience, resulting in strengthened customer relationships and increased brand loyalty.\nThat one doesn’t have numbers attached to it, but it still illustrates the significance of your work. \n\nStruggling to write your own impactful bullet points? Teal's resume creator has suggestions, examples, and prompts to walk you through it. You can also use AI to automatically generate and improve your quantifiable bullet points. \n\n‍\n\nTeal's AI helps you write relevant, metric-rich resume achievements.\nTeal's AI helps you write relevant, metric-rich resume bullet points.\n‍\n\nCAR method resume examples for your work history\nDeveloped and implemented a targeted digital marketing campaign for a client in the consumer goods industry, resulting in a 30% increase in website traffic, a 25% boost in online sales, and a 20% rise in social media engagement within a three-month period.\n\nChallenge: Low website traffic, online sales, and social media engagement\nAction: Developed and implemented a targeted digital marketing campaign\nResult: 30% increase in web traffic, 25% boost in online sales, and a 20% rise in social media engagement\nImplemented a new employee training and development program, resulting in a 20% increase in employee retention and a 15% reduction in turnover within the first year of implementation.\n\nChallenge: High turnover as a result of lacklustre employee training and professional development\nAction: Implemented a new program\nResult: 20% increase in employee retention and 15% reduction in turnover\nIdentified inefficiencies in the codebase and refactored key components, leading to a 30% improvement in application performance and a 25% reduction in bug reports from end-users within a six-month period.\n\nChallenge: Inefficiencies in the codebase\nAction: Refactored key components\nResult: 30% improvement in application performance and a 25% reduction in bug reports\n‍\n\nHow to use the CAR method in your professional summary\nYour professional summary or resume summary goes at the top of your document and is a  concise overview of your most important or relevant skills, experiences, and accomplishments—and it’s also a great place to apply the CAR method.\n\nIt’ll be a little more subtle here, as your summary focuses on your career as a whole and not a specific position or professional experience.\n\nTo apply it in this context, zoom out on your entire career so far and ask yourself:\n\nWhat are some of the biggest challenges I’ve solved?\nWhat are my most meaningful responsibilities or skills?\nWhat are my most notable achievements?\nAgain, return to the job description to prioritize relevance and then piece together a summary that hits on the key points.\n\n‍\n\nCAR method resume example for your professional summary\n\"Seasoned sales territory manager with over a decade of proven success in driving revenue growth and expanding market share within highly competitive industries.

Frustrating, right?\nYet employers hiring for entry-level roles likely don’t expect you to have full-time work experience. Instead, they’re looking for experience that relates to the role you’re applying for—whether that’s previous internships, part-time work, volunteering, extracurriculars, or coursework.\nThis guide discusses how to add coursework to your resume, including why you should include it, what courses to include, and how to format this additional experience.\nNeed to add coursework to your resume? Make a free resume in Teal today. \n‍\nWhat is considered relevant coursework?\nRelevant coursework on a resume refers to academic classes you’ve taken that align with the focus, requirements, and skills needed for a particular job. \nFor example, if you’re applying for a software engineering role, you might list coursework that you took at a reputable computer science university that demonstrates your experience with programming. Or, if you’re applying for a public relations role, you might list coursework in communications and English to show both your interpersonal and writing skills.\nIf you’re unsure what coursework is relevant to the role you’re applying for, Teal’s AI Resume Builder can help you match your qualifications to the job description. Simply add a job description to the resume builder and use Teal’s Job Matching Tool to identify the most important keywords, hard skills, and soft skills the company is looking for. Then, add any relevant coursework that demonstrates those skills.\n‍\nListing relevant coursework on a resume is an effective way to show you’re qualified for the role with the right skills and experience—especially if you don’t have professional experience yet. \n‍\nHow to list relevant coursework on your resume\nThere are a few different ways to add relevant coursework to your resume, but all involve adjusting your Education section.\n‍\n1. Add a new line in your Education section\nThe most straightforward way to add relevant coursework on your resume is to simply list out your classes underneath your degree information. Simply add a line called “relevant coursework,” then write a list of the courses you’d like to include.‍\nCourse titles should be capitalized; however, you don’t need to include the full or exact name of the class you took. For example, if you took “Computer Science III: Data Structures and Algorithms,” you can shorten it to “Data Structures and Algorithms” or change it to “Advanced Data Structure and Algorithms” to show the level of the course. Your goal is to best illustrate the overall topic of the course you took.\n‍\n2. Include a bullet point list of your relevant coursework\nIf you have room to include a bullet point list, adding relevant coursework to your resume in this format can be more readable and bring further attention to the courses you’ve listed. ‍\n3. Add descriptions to your coursework\nWhile you don’t need to add descriptions when listing relevant coursework on a resume, it can be a helpful way to draw the lines for the recruiting or hiring manager who’s wondering how your classes stack up against the job requirements. To do this, create a relevant coursework resume section within your Education section.\n‍\nTo add descriptions, share a brief sentence or two about what you learned, including any hard or soft skills. If there are skills mentioned in the job description that apply to the course, be sure to name them.\n‍\nRelevant coursework resume examples\nNow that you know how to add coursework, here are a few relevant coursework resume examples that put those steps into practice. \nClearly and simply list relevant coursework on your resume with Teal’s AI Resume Builder.\n‍\n\n‍\nRelevant coursework template\nReady to add your relevant coursework to your resume? Here’s a relevant coursework template to copy and paste and fill out with your own qualifications:\nEducation\n\n[Degree Name] in [Major]\n[University Name], [University Location]\n\n[Graduation Month and Date]\n\nRelevant coursework:\n‍\n[Course name 1]: [One-sentence description of what you learned in the course, including any topics or skills relevant to the job description]\n[Course name 12]: [One-sentence description of what you learned in the course, including any topics or skills relevant to the job description]\n[Course name 3]: [One-sentence description of what you learned in the course, including any topics or skills relevant to the job description]\n‍\nWhere to list coursework on a resume\nThere are several places where you can list coursework on a resume, depending on your level of experience and the type of job you’re applying for. Here are some options:\nEducation section: You can list relevant coursework in the education section of your resume, either in a separate subsection or as part of your degree information. This is the most common approach and keeps your academic achievements organized.\nSeparate section: If you have a lot of relevant coursework or if you’re applying for a job that requires a strong academic background, you can create a separate section for your coursework. Label it “Relevant Coursework” to draw attention to your academic qualifications.\nSkills section: You can also list relevant coursework in the skills section of your resume, especially if you’re applying for a job that requires specific technical skills. This approach can highlight your practical knowledge and how it aligns with the job requirements.\n‍\nWhen to include relevant coursework on your resume \nAdding relevant coursework on your resume can demonstrate additional ways you’ve built skills and experience relevant to the job search. However, you don’t always need to include this section to your resume.\nYou should include relevant courses on your resume when you’re:\nEarly career: If you’re a recent graduate with limited professional experience, highlighting relevant coursework can help demonstrate you have the skills and knowledge you need to do the job.\nGoing through a career transition: While career changers have more professional experience than early career applicants, you’re still new to the field you’re applying to. Coursework can prove you have the right knowledge and skills, even if you don’t have all of the relevant previous positions. (Resume certifications can be effective for this purpose, too—but these typically go in a “certifications” section.)\nTrying to demonstrate specialized skills: Relevant coursework can be an additional way to prove you have valuable skills—especially ones you haven’t used in your professional experience yet (and therefore would not belong in your work experience section).\nGenerally, you should include relevant courses on a resume when you’re about to graduate or have recently graduated and worked professionally for less than a few years. It can also add value to your resume if you need to demonstrate expertise or skill that’s not otherwise listed on your resume.\n‍\nHow to choose relevant coursework for your resume\nYou’ve likely taken dozens of courses in your time at school. So how do you know which ones to add to your resume?\nFirst, make a list of all the relevant classes you think could apply to the roles you're evaluating. Then, for each role, consider:\nRelevance to the required job experience: Does the course demonstrate you have the expertise the recruiter or hiring manager is looking for?\nRelevance to the required skills: Did any of these courses teach you skills listed in the “requirements” section of the job description?\nImpact and achievements: Are there specific projects, research, or presentations that you did as a part of the course that are relevant to the role?\nRelevant coursework on your resume should be additive to the value of your resume. Each course serves a purpose—whether that’s demonstrating a specific expertise, skill, or knowledge gap not otherwise identified in your resume qualifications.\n‍\nBenefits of adding relevant coursework\nAdding relevant coursework to your resume can have several benefits, especially for students and entry-level professionals. Here are some of the advantages of including relevant coursework on your resume:\nDemonstrates skills and knowledge: Relevant coursework can showcase your skills and knowledge in a particular field, making you a more attractive candidate to potential employers. For instance, listing courses like “Data Structures” or “Marketing Analytics” can highlight your technical and analytical abilities.\nEnhances credibility: Including relevant coursework on your resume can demonstrate your commitment to your field of study and enhance your credibility as a candidate. It shows that you have invested time and effort into acquiring the necessary knowledge.\nFills gaps in experience: For students and entry-level professionals, relevant coursework can fill gaps in experience and demonstrate your potential to perform well in a particular role. If you lack professional experience, coursework can serve as evidence of your capabilities.\nShows relevance to the job: Relevant coursework can show that you have the skills and knowledge required for the job, making you a more competitive candidate. Tailoring your coursework to match the job description can make your resume stand out to hiring managers.\n‍\nHow to select and add relevant coursework using Teal\nIf you’re unsure if relevant coursework has a place on your resume, including what kind of classes, Teal’s AI Resume Builder can help analyze both your resume and the job description to see if it’s a good fit.\nTeal’s Analysis Mode analyzes your resume structure, measurable results, and keywords to ensure your resume is as concise and impact-forward as possible.\nOnce you’ve filled out your resume in Teal, the Analysis Mode can help you identify whether you may need to add more information or keywords on your resume. If you have a relevant class that fills that gap, you’ll know to add it to your resume.\n‍\nHow to tailor coursework to the job description\nWhen listing coursework on your resume, it’s essential to tailor it to the job description. Here are some tips:\nRead the job description carefully: Study the job description and requirements to identify the skills and knowledge required for the job. Pay attention to the keywords and phrases used by the employer. (Pro Tip: Teal automates this step with its Resume Job Description Match feature)\nIdentify relevant coursework: Identify the coursework that is relevant to the job and highlight it on your resume. Focus on courses that align with the skills and experience mentioned in the job description.\nUse keywords: Use keywords from the job description to describe your coursework and make it more relevant to the job. This can help your resume pass through applicant tracking systems (ATS) and catch the attention of hiring managers\n‍\n4 tips to add relevant coursework on your resume the right way \nReady to start adding relevant coursework on your resume? Here are some best practices.\n‍\n1. Only relevant coursework that matches the job description should be added\nRelevant coursework is described that way for a reason—it’s relevant to the job that you’re applying for. That means that the courses you list are related to the role’s required experience and skills. \nTeal’s Job Matching Tool can help you identify gaps between your resume and a given job description. The tool can tell you what keywords you’re missing for both hard and soft skills—which can then help you figure out if there’s a course you can add to fill that gap.\n‍\n2. You don’t need to use the official name of the course\nCollege course names have a variety of structures depending on the institution you attend. Don’t worry about including the official name of the course you took; instead, focus on using language the hiring manager is looking for.\nFor example, if you took “Introduction to Microeconomic Theory,” you may opt to list the course as “Microeconomics.” This is a simpler, to-the-point version that addresses the main focus of the course.\nOr, let’s say you took a course with a more poetic title like “Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence.” If the job description says they want someone familiar with artificial intelligence, then you may keep as is or adjust to “Artificial Intelligence.” However, if the job description specifies that it wants someone with expertise in machine learning, you could adjust the language to specifically address your experience with machine learning.\n‍\n3. Feature academic projects to further highlight your coursework\nWhile relevant coursework on your resume demonstrates you have academic knowledge of the topic, you can highlight specific projects to provide tangible examples of how you put that knowledge into practice.\nAgain, these projects should be relevant—meaning they align with the job you’re applying for. For example, if you're applying for a data analyst position, you could highlight a data analysis project you completed in a statistics course by adding a project link to your resume. \n‍\n4. Include academic awards and your GPA\nTo further highlight your coursework and academic achievements, consider including any awards, honors, or scholarships you’ve received, as well as your GPA. This demonstrates not only that you’ve taken relevant courses, but also that you’ve excelled while in school. \nAdd your GPA and awards on your resume in the Education section. If you have multiple honors or awards you want to list and add further context to, you can create a separate “Honors and Awards” section.\n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid when adding coursework to a resume\nWhen listing coursework on your resume, there are several common mistakes to avoid. Here are some of them:\nListing irrelevant coursework: Only list coursework that is relevant to the job you’re applying for. Irrelevant coursework can make your resume look cluttered and unprofessional. Focus on courses that directly relate to the job description.\nNot tailoring coursework to the job: Failing to tailor your coursework to the job description can make it seem like you’re not a good fit for the job. Customize your resume for each application to highlight the most relevant courses.\nNot using keywords: Not using keywords from the job description can make it harder for your resume to pass through applicant tracking systems (ATS) and for hiring managers to see your relevance to the job. Incorporate relevant keywords to improve your chances of getting noticed.\nBy avoiding these common mistakes and following the tips outlined above, you can create a strong and effective resume that showcases your relevant coursework and helps you land your dream job.\n‍\nStart adding relevant coursework on your resume with Teal\nAdding relevant coursework to your resume can be an effective way to demonstrate skills and expertise—especially when you’re a recent graduate or changing careers.\nTo add relevant courses, you can add a line, list, or section in your Education section. While you don’t need to add descriptions of each course, you can adjust the course names to match the language the hiring manager is looking for. If you do choose to add descriptions, you can list relevant skills and topics you learned in the course.\nAdding relevant coursework to your resume is efficient and effective with Teal’s AI Resume Builder.

Take full advantage of the Project section by adding keywords associated with the projects when filling out the project name and description using relevant, trending industry terms to enhance your profile in search results.\n\nIt solidifies your skills and talent\nBy now, you know it’s best to show—rather than tell—potential employers you have the skills you say you do. The Projects section on your LinkedIn profile is evidence of your potential.\n\nThe cool thing is you can upload anything—no matter if it was conducted at your current role or not. This is your chance to showcase your best work and back-up your talent with proof.\n\nIt enhances your profile and professional image\nResumes are built for summarizing your work history and work experience. Portfolios are created to show off your creative work and projects. LinkedIn is a professional profile where you get to do both.\n\nFilling out your profile as much as possible enhances your reputation. By having a complete, well-crafted profile, you appear more experienced and professional. It also helps tackle both the “resume or portfolio” debate with one stone.\n\nIt highlights your teamwork skills\nPotential employers check out your profile not just for your work history and technical skills showcased in a particular project, but to get a feel of your soft skills as a prospective employee, too. For example, how well you work with others.\n\nThe Projects section allows you to add any teammates you collaborated with on a project, giving potential employers a birds-eye view of your teamwork capabilities. Bringing a major project from start to finish with other professionals is a great way to prove you work well with others. \n\n‍\n\nWhat types of projects can you add on LinkedIn?\nProjects are attached to a role, so you can add any project as long as it's connected to a role on your Experience section. You can also connect Projects to coworkers or colleagues, but you’ll need to be connected to the person on LinkedIn. \n\nThat said, it’s up to you to highlight your proudest moments. Just be sure they're related to your work history and job search.\n\nFrom graphic design to portfolios to project management, here’s a list of projects to consider adding to your profile:\n\nCase Studies\nEvent organization plans\nE-books\nBlog posts\nWebinars\nOutlines to classes or courses you teach\nPresentations or lectures\nFeatured articles \nNewsletters\nGraphic design projects\nBlueprints\nSales management processes\n‍\n\nHelp your work projects stand out\nProjects demonstrate to employer’s your efforts, experience, teamwork abilities, and talent. Some projects can be a simple bullet in the Experience section, but many projects deserve a spotlight on your Projects section on your LinkedIn and even your resume.\n\nWith Teal, you can select or deselect which projects you want to show, instantly customizing each resume with the click of a button. Strengthen your resume with your keywords from the job you’re applying to, boosting your chances of getting in front of the employers.\n\nCreate a free resume with Teal’s AI Resume Builder to get started.\n\nTry Teal for Free\n‍\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do I showcase my project on LinkedIn?\nHow do I share my project on LinkedIn?\nHow do you feature a project on LinkedIn?","URL Slug":"add-projects-linkedin-guide-2024","Meta Description":"Discover how to add projects to your LinkedIn profile with our step-by-step 2024 guide to highlight your work and skills effectively."}}]}

So exactly how long should a resume be? Ideally, you’ll fit your key skills, work history, and achievement-based bullet points on a one or two-page resume.\n\nThink that means opting for a tiny font and nonexistent margins to save space? Not exactly. A smarter strategy for hitting the right length is to remove irrelevant content.\nNot everything deserves real estate on your resume—and sometimes that means omitting some of your previous positions, especially if they’re older jobs unrelated to the open role \n‍\n‍\nSo how many jobs should you list on a resume? And how can you determine which ones to list and which ones to skip? This guide has the information you need, including how to include each job on your resume\nUnsure of which jobs to include on your resume? Create a free resume with Teal that pulls from your entire career to focus on relevant and targeted details.\n‍\nHow many jobs should you list on a resume?\nThe question is less about how many jobs to list and more about how far back in your employment history to go. In general, you want to focus on your most recent positions and experiences—meaning your resume shouldn’t go back more than 10 to 15 years.\n\nFor some job seekers, that might mean including one or two jobs, while others might have had upwards of five jobs in that same period. \n‍\nFactors that influence how many jobs you should have on your resume\nWhile that provides a general framework, there are a few other criteria to keep in mind when determining how many jobs to list on a resume.\nWhen listing your jobs, consider:\nRelevance: The point of your resume isn’t just to show that you’re skilled and qualified. It’s to show that you’re qualified for that specific job. That’s why relevance should be your first and most important filter when thinking about how many jobs to include. For example, if one of your older jobs is closely related to the role you’re applying for, it’s worth including—even if it’s further back in your history. \nTenure: Were you laid off after only a few months? Or did you leave quickly because a position was a bad fit? Your resume is a sales document and not a detailed breakdown of your work history. You have full control over what to include (and not include). So, if there’s a position you’re not proud of, triggers more questions than answers, makes you look like a job hopper, or adds no relevant skills or context, you can skip it. Doing so can create gaps in your history, so be prepared to address those if you’re asked about them.‍\nApplication instructions: Check the job description for instructions about resume length. If the job ad says resumes need to stick with one page, do that.‍\nCareer progression: The perfect resume goes beyond showing what you’ve done and also shows how you’ve grown, especially if you’ve climbed the ladder with a single employer (for example, starting as an intern and landing numerous promotions). Including all the jobs you held with a particular employer shows the hiring manager where you started before moving through multiple roles at the same company. That clear progression presents you as a motivated, qualified, and strong candidate.\n‍\n‍\nWhat’s the ideal number of jobs to include on a resume?\nYou probably don’t need to list every job you’ve held since high school on your resume. There’s a lot of nuance in resume writing, and no one “ideal” number of jobs. It hinges on a variety of factors, including:\nTotal professional experience\n Frequency of job changes\nRelevant work experience\nFor example, a more experienced job seeker with decades of professional history will likely have more to include than a recent graduate who’s worked one entry-level job. Similarly, a candidate with several relevant jobs will likely include more roles than someone making a career change.\nSo, keep in mind that the below numbers are a general recommendation and not a hard and fast rule. It’s up to you to review the job description carefully and make a judgment call about how many older positions to include in your document.\n‍\nIf you have more than 15 years of experience\nNumber of jobs to include: 4+ jobs\nEven if you’ve stayed with the same employer for the past 15 years, you’ve probably climbed the ranks and potentially achieved a senior position. Displaying the jobs you’ve held over the past 15 years not only shows your relevant experience but also your career progression.\n‍\nIf you have less than 15 years of experience\nNumber of jobs to include: 2-4 jobs\nYou’re in the sweet spot where you have enough work history to showcase your skills but not so many jobs that you need to narrow down. You’ll include all relevant positions you’ve held in your career so far. Considering the average tenure with any one employer is a little over four years, you’ll probably have somewhere in the range of two to four jobs to showcase. List all of them but include more detail with your most recent jobs.\n‍\nIf you have little or no experience\nNumber of jobs to include: As many relevant professional experiences as you have\nYour problem isn’t that you have too many jobs—it’s that you feel like you don’t have enough to fill out one page (let alone a second page). Keep in mind that your work history can include less traditional opportunities like internships, freelance work, contract work, short term jobs, and seasonal or temporary employment.\n‍\n5 tips for listing jobs on a resume\nReady to pull your resume together? Start by getting all of your employment history down on paper—your past employers, job titles, and responsibilities. Here’s a guide on how to find your work history to get you rolling.\nWhen you write everything down in a “base resume,” it becomes a reliable resource to return to as you create a tailored resume for each position. You can select relevant pieces rather than starting from scratch every time.\n‍\n‍\nOnce you have your base resume ready, here are five more tips to keep in mind when listing your work experience.\n‍\n1. Use a reverse-chronological format\nThere are a variety of resume formats you can use. But a reverse-chronological resume is the most widely accepted and understood format among hiring managers, with 75% saying they prefer this format.\nUsing this approach, list your past positions in reverse chronological order—with your most recent job at the top. While a functional resume format might give you the wiggle room to list more, using a chronological order is more intuitive and can help your resume stand out for the right reasons.\n‍\n2. Analyze the job description\nAny resume writer will tell you that relevance is the name of the game. So, as you weed through your past positions and refine your bullet points, use the job posting as your guide.\nWhat skills does the position demand? What experience level does the employer want? What duties is this role responsible for? All of those are clues you can use to determine whether an old job should be included, emphasized, or removed.\n‍\nUltimately, Teal CEO and Founder Dave Fano puts it best:\n‍\"The job of your resume is to showcase the top 10% of your experience that's directly relevant to the role you're applying for. It's about strategically aligning that 10% with the job's requirements to make a case for why you're the ideal candidate. Think of it as a sales document, not a history lesson. Details that aren't relevant or that don't align with a job's requirements probably don't belong on your resume.\"\n‍\n3. Emphasize your job title\nDon’t let your position title get lost or buried in your document. Give it a prominent placement and write it in bold or bigger font to ensure the hiring manager can’t miss it. That’s especially important if you’re listing multiple roles under a single employer.\nUse a Resume Template\n‍\n‍\n4. Include more detail with relevant or recent jobs\nThis process isn’t just about determining which jobs to include—it’s also about which jobs to highlight by including additional resume bullet points.\nInclude more detail for jobs that are: \nRecent: In general, the more recent a job is, the more detail it warrants. It’s the most accurate representation of your current skills and capabilities.\nRelevant: That doesn’t mean all of your older jobs should be deprioritized. If they’re directly related to the role you want, they deserve attention.\nWondering how many bullet points per job? For recent and relevant roles, you can list up to seven bullet points. But you might only need three bullet points for older or less-related roles. \n‍\n5. Double-check your verb tense\nVerb tense is a small detail that can slip through the cracks when writing and editing your resume, but getting it right improves clarity and adds polish to your document.\nIf you are currently working in a particular role, use the present tense to start each of your bullets. \nExample:\nAssist with 15+ job fairs and recruiting events, successfully recruiting 200 potential candidates each year\nFor jobs you no longer work, update all of your bullet points to past tense.\nExample:\nAssisted with 15+ job fairs and recruiting events, successfully recruiting 200 potential candidates each year\n‍\nHow to list jobs on a resume with Teal\nWhen you’re ready to list your experience and other accomplishments on your resume, starting from scratch is daunting.\nTeal’s Resume Builder can help you streamline the process of choosing and showcasing the right jobs. Here’s how to get started:\n‍\n1. Build your base resume\nYour base resume is an exhaustive list that includes absolutely everything from your professional history—all of your past jobs, skills, relevant coursework, and impressive accomplishments.\nIt takes a bit of work, but you’re creating your starting point. When it’s time to write a new resume to apply for a job, you can simply select what information to include or remove. \nIf you have some of your work history saved in an old resume or LinkedIn portfolio, you can upload it to Teal to better manage your work experience.\nCreate a Resume From Your LinkedIn Profile\n‍\n‍\n2. Create a new resume\nWith your base resume ready to go, click “new resume” in Teal. That will create a new resume that auto-fills with all of your content. \nNow, it’s easy to go through and check or uncheck boxes to select what information should be included in this version of your resume.\nFor example, don’t want to include a specific role? Uncheck the box and it’s immediately removed from your document. Want to remove certain responsibilities or add new ones? You can do that too.\n\n‍\n3. Refine and polish your document\nWhen you’ve determined what content you want to include, you’re ready to brush up the appearance of your document.\n\nHead to the “Design” tab, where you can select from an assortment of professional resume templates, adjust your alignment and layout, and tweak your font and colors.\n‍\nAnd, of course, before you export your document, remember to take your time to proofread and edit your resume carefully and thoroughly.\n‍\nHow many jobs to include on a resume depends on you\nHow many jobs to list is yet another aspect of the job search without a tried and true answer. \nIn general, most people list somewhere between two and four jobs on a resume. But exactly how many jobs you’ll include depends on a variety of factors, including your experience level, relevance, and tenure.\nRather than defaulting to firm restrictions and recommendations, keep your focus on creating a resume that presents you as the most skilled, relevant, and qualified fit. That’s when you’ll stand the best chance of snagging the hiring manager’s eye—whether you list one job or 10 of them.\nSign Up, It's Free!\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDo I need to list every job on my resume?\nIs five jobs too many on a resume?\nIs it okay to omit jobs on a resume?"}}]}

It's about weaving your experience, skills, and impact into a story that resonates with hiring professionals—with each word making them want to learn more about what you bring to the table.\n\nThat said, there are benchmarks you can use as a guide for different career stages. This article covers what they are, the rationale behind them, and actionable tips for getting your resume length where it needs to be.\n\nStruggling to write a resume that's the right length? Get started with Teal’s Free Resume Builder today.\n\nHow long should a resume be in 2024?\nThe average resume is between one and two pages. But employer needs, advancements in tech, the evolving job market, and a changing career landscape mean resumes also adapt accordingly.\n\nTrends around their length, format, style, or otherwise—are no different than any other fads. They evolve. What was relevant five years ago may not be the standard today. \n\nCurrent resume length trends and standards\nThere's been a lot of attention around one-page resumes. And not without reason. It's important to convey your worth succinctly.\n\nAn example of a one page resume \nOne-page resumes are especially fitting for entry-level job seekers.\nWith so many candidates applying for the same roles, a compact, well-organized resume respects a hiring manager or recruiter's time and showcases your ability to communicate effectively and prioritize information.\n\nBut with that in mind, minimizing your impact, skills, and experiences (or changing font size, margins, and white space) to adhere to a certain length can be counterproductive.\n\nReducing essential resume elements might lead to a professional overview that:\n\nDoesn't accurately represent your qualifications\nLacks context\nIsn't aligned with the roles you're applying to\nIs hard to read\nBuild Your Resume For Free\n‍\n\nHow many pages should a resume be: One-page vs. multi-page resumes\nWhile resume length depends on several factors, resumes should typically be between one to two pages and no longer than three. Like almost every fad, resume length isn't without debate. Even with single-page resumes trending, two-page resumes and even the three-page resume are still widely used. Here are some pros and cons:\n\nPros of one-page resumes:\n\nQuick scanning by hiring managers and recruiters\nHighlights key skills quickly\nIdeal for less complex career experience\nCons of one-page resumes:\n\nStruggle with depth \nChallenges in showcasing diverse skills and quantifiable impact\nCan feel restrictive for comprehensive experience\nPros of multi-page resumes:\n\nSpace for showcasing experience and depth\nBetter for diverse or technical roles\nRoom to balance white space and content \nCons of multi-page resumes:\n\nPotential for irrelevant information\nMay use unnecessary words or fillers\nIncreased risk of losing reader's interest\nAn example of a two page resume\nUsing two pages is ideal if you have over a decade of experience.\nWhat influences your resume length?\nIndustry and job level play important roles in the length of a resume.\n\nSpecific fields and levels of seniority often demand the best resume format that offers a more comprehensive view of publications, detailed experience, residency, research, or case history.\n\nFor example, these might include professionals in:\n\nMedicine\nLaw\nResearch\nAcademia\nC-suite and V-level executive positions\nDirector roles\nOn the other hand, students, career pivoters, and entry-level professionals typically have less content, making a one-page resume more applicable.\n\nIf you're a mid-level professional, you're in a unique spot. The challenge lies in distilling years of experience into a format that's both comprehensive and concise—judiciously deciding what to highlight that reflects development and growth as professional, relevant skills, and how that ties to impact.\n\nRegardless of industry or professional level, the heart of the matter when it comes to \"How many pages should a resume be?\" is relevancy.\n\nTeal CEO and Founder Dave Fano puts it best:\n\n\"The job of your resume is to showcase the top 10% of your experience that's directly relevant to the role you're applying for.\n\nIt's about strategically aligning that 10% with the job's requirements to make a case for why you're the ideal candidate. Think of it as a sales document, not a history lesson. Details that aren't relevant or that don't align with a job's requirements probably don't belong on your resume.\"\n5 key tips for ideal resume length\n1. Tailor your resume\nCustomizing your resume for each application is crucial. Keeping your content 100% relevant to the role means you won't waste additional space with unnecessary filler. So, how do you tailor your resume? \n\nAnalyze the job description: Identify keywords and phrases highlighting essential skills and experiences. These will be your guide.\nUse the right keywords and phrases: Incorporate keywords from the job description throughout your resume—showcasing hard and soft skills alongside impact.\nPrioritize relevant experience over quantity: It's not about filling pages; it's about relevance. Whether your resume is one or two pages, ensure that the information you include speaks directly to the needs of the job and showcases how you're the best fit for the role.\nSave time tailoring with Teal\nTeal's AI resume creator pulls the hard skills, soft skills, and other important language from any job description. Then, use the Match Score feature to see how well your content aligns with the job—increasing your score by focusing on the correct language.\n\nTailor Your Resume Now\n‍\n\n‍\n\n2. Communicate achievements with bullet points\nUse resume bullet points instead of describing your professional experience in multiple sentences or paragraphs.\n\nEach role should have:\n\n3-5 bullet points of achievements\nA limit of one or two lines\nMetrics numbers and data to highlight impact\nHere's a general structure to use as a guide:\n\nSuccess/Action Verb + Noun + Metric + [Strategy Optional] + Outcome = 1 bulleted achievement \n\n3. Focus on structure and design\n‍\n\nResume structure and design also influence the overall length—ensuring every word earns its place.\n\nHere are some design and formatting elements for job seekers like you to consider: \n\nLayout: Choose a layout—like a reverse chronological resume—that highlights strengths first\nFont: Select a legible 10-12 point font that's professional and easy to read at a glance\nHeadings and sections: Use clear, concise headings to differentiate between sections\nBrevity and precision: Use bullet points and focus on impact and results rather than duties\nVisual elements: Do not use graphics or tables, especially for resumes being parsed by an ATS\n4. Use concise language\nEvery word on your resume matters. Focusing on action verbs and using active voice can help you cut down on filler words—while coming across as confident to a hiring manager.\n\nFor example, a resume bullet point using active voice looks like this:\n\nManaged three employees during a comprehensive social media campaign, increasing conversion rates by 7%\n\nIn comparison, the passive voice looks like this:\n\nThree employees were managed by me during a comprehensive social media campaign, increasing conversion rates by 7%\n\n5. Edit (and then edit again)\nWhile you may not create resumes for a living, your editing skills need to be on par with that of a certified professional resume writer. Even minor mistakes or the presence of filler words can detract from the impact of your content—potentially costing you the opportunity to make a great first impression.\n\nA resume that's polished and free of errors demonstrates your diligence and attention to detail.\n\nEdit your resume for:\n\nSpelling\nGrammar\nFiller words (for example, actually, just, basically, and very)\nJargon or clichés\nRedundancy\nIrrelevant information\nAn screenshot of Teal's Spelling and Grammar Tool\nUse Teal to save time by editing your resume where you write it.\nRemember, editing isn't a one-time job. Each time you tailor your content, review your resume again. This process can help catch any new errors and ensure your resume is as effective and polished as possible.\n\nBuild Your Best Resume\n‍\n\nResume length for professionals\nWhen choosing the correct length for a resume, it's essential to consider your career stage. So how long should your resume be for a professional at an entry-level vs. someone in an executive position?\n\nThe relevant experience, skills, and accomplishments you have to share can (and likely will) significantly influence whether your resume should be concise or more detailed. \n\nHere's a breakdown of how long a resume should be for professionals at different stages:\n\nStudent and recent graduate resume length \nIdeal length: One-page resume\n\nRationale: With limited work experience, students or recent graduates should focus on educational achievements, relevant coursework, and internships. The challenge is to be concise yet impactful, making every word count to showcase potential and willingness to learn.\n\nA screenshot of Teal's resume templates.\nTeal's free resume templates are designed to be the ideal length for any career stage.\nEntry-level resume length\nIdeal length: One-page resume\n\nRationale: Similar to students and recent graduates, entry-level professionals should keep their resumes to one page when possible, emphasizing any work experience, volunteer work, skills, and accomplishments relevant to the job they're applying for. This stage focuses on potential and relevant experiences that align with the job requirements.\n\nMid-level professional resume length\nIdeal Length: One to two-page resume\n\nRationale: Mid-level professionals with three to ten years of experience can opt for a two-page resume if necessary. This is especially true if you have a wealth of relevant experiences, projects, and skills that you cannot fit onto one page. The first page should capture the most critical and recent achievements, while the second page can detail earlier roles and contributions—as long as they're relevant.\n\nBuild Your Resume For Free\n‍\n\nSenior-level professional resume length\nIdeal Length: Two-page resume\n\nRationale: Senior professionals often have extensive experience, publications, or impactful projects that justify a two-page resume. Here, the focus is on leadership roles, notable accomplishments, and a track record of success. If you're at the senior level, your resume should present a compelling narrative of growth, results, and leadership.\n\nAn example of a senior-level, two-page resume\nA two-page resume is ideal for senior-level positions.\nExecutive position resume length\nIdeal Length: Two to three-page resume\n\nRationale: Executives can extend their resumes to three pages if necessary, given the scope of things like:\n\nExperience\nLeadership positions\nBoard memberships\nSpeaking engagements\nPublications\nSignificant bullet achievements\nAn executive resume should tell a strategic story of career progression, leadership capacity, and the ability to drive results and success. (But as stated above, this isn't a hard and fast rule; every word should be relevant and applicable to the specific role you're applying to.)\n\nCustomizing your resume length with Teal\nThe Teal's AI Resume Builder has a Design Mode feature that makes customizing your resume for the ideal length even easier.\n\nStart by selecting the resume template that best reflects your needs (and personality).\n\nexample of design mode's customization options within resume builder \nGet started by choosing a template.\nNext, choose the best font, color, margin size, and more to align with your ideal resume length.\n\nA graphic of some of Teal Resume Builder's design options.\nChoose font, colors, formats, and more in Teal's Design Mode.\nFinally, opt to name and organize your resume sections in a way that represents your experience best (for example, in a combination resume format) to capitalize on space.\n\n‍\n\nOptimize your resume length with Teal\nThe length of your resume isn't about the number of words but their relevance and impact.\n\nTaking actions like tailoring each section to highlight your strongest qualifications and communicating your achievements and impact with bullet points is essential for taking advantage of resume real estate.\n\nLuckily, the Teal's AI Resume Writer makes reaching the ideal length for your experience a seamless process.

On average, how long do recruiters spend reviewing a resume? As a recruiter myself, I can tell you it varies significantly for different companies and roles.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\n‍\n\nHow long do recruiters spend reviewing a resume?\nAccording to a range of surveys, and even studies using eye tracking devices, recruiters spend an average of just seven to nine seconds reviewing a resume.\n\nOf course, how long recruiters spend varies widely. For roles with clear cut, technical requirements, recruiters may spend more time scanning to identify those specific qualifications; for a more senior role, we’re scanning for specific job titles that show progression in the field.\n\n‍\n\nWhy do recruiters spend only a few seconds reviewing a resume?\nThe average corporate job posting receives 250 applications! But for well known companies or remote roles, that number trends higher. Onsite or niche roles on the other hand, see fewer applicants. And recruiters are typically working on five to ten roles at a time, sometimes more.\n\nMany of those applicants don’t meet the minimum qualifications for the role, so it doesn’t make sense for a recruiter (or busy hiring manager) to read through every resume. Given the large volume, they will quickly scan for a few seconds to vet and prioritize candidates worth a second read through.\n\nOf course this depends on the role. For a role that has just 20 applicants or many job openings, a recruiter will probably deep dive into each resume given their limited applicant pool, and hiring managers will recognize they need to consider candidates who may not meet all of the requirements. But for a competitive role, most recruiters will screen resumes. So your resume needs to catch their attention in that initial screen.\n\n‍\n\nHow to make your resume stand out in seconds\nWhat does a recruiter focus on in those first seven seconds? \n\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nThey are going to focus on the following factors:\n\nWhat industry you’ve worked in\nWhat companies you’ve worked for\nWhat job titles you’ve had\nThis is going to help them understand how closely your experience aligns to the role they are working to fill.\n\nJob seekers can improve job interview callback rates by tailoring each resume to the specific job. It’s not about having a perfect resume or spending hours crafting your resume, it’s about making sure your resume stands out to a recruiter or hiring manager who has just a few seconds to review resumes.\n\nTailor Your Resume\n‍\n\nTips to help your resume pass the initial screen\n‍\n\n1. Adjust your job title\nAlign your job title to the job family you’re applying for, within reason.\n\nExample: An Operations Manager who is also the HR manager may want to use a title like “Operations and HR Manager” or “Operations Manager (HR, Finance, and Ops”).\n\n‍\n\n2. Focus on relevance\nShowcase your most relevant accomplishments and skills near the top of their resume, following a reverse chronological format.\n\nRemember: longer resumes or more bullet points don’t necessarily strengthen your resume or leave a more positive impression!\n\n‍\n\n3.

So if you have a proven track record of academic excellence, you might wonder how to put graduated with honors on your resume.\nIf you have some of the highest distinctions, like cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude, there are specific ways to include Latin honors on your resume. In some cases, it may not make sense to include them. In this guide, learn, about academic honors, whether to add Latin honors on your resume or not, and how to put cum laude on your resume.\nNeed to highlight academic achievements on your resume? Make a free resume that showcases cum laude and other distinctions with Teal's AI Resume Builder.\n‍\nUnderstanding academic honors\nAcademic honors are notable distinctions that highlight a student’s excellence in school. Some include being on the Dean’s list or honor roll. There are also “Latin honors” given to students in a graduating class and based on grade point average (GPA). There are three different types of this academic honor, which use Latin words to describe the level of distinction. \n‍\nCum laude\nThe term “cum laude” is a type of Latin honor that refers to graduating with honors. To qualify for this distinction, your GPA needs to be above a certain level. Each school sets its own criteria and standards. \nFor example, graduating seniors at the University of Connecticut must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 to get the cum laude distinction. However, for students at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, you must have a GPA of 3.5 to receive the cum laude distinction. \n‍\nMagna cum laude\n“Magna cum laude” is the next level of distinction and refers to graduating with high honors. The Latin translates to “with great praise” and is a step above “cum laude.” Criteria can vary by school, but the minimum GPA requirements are higher than cum laude— for example, a GPA of 3.4 or 3.7.\n‍\nSumma cum laude\nThe term “summa cum laude” is the most prestigious of Latin academic honors and refers to graduating with the highest honors. The translation means “with highest praise.” The GPA requirements can vary but are the highest out of all of the Latin honors. To qualify for this level of distinction, students at graduation may need a GPA of 3.7 or 3.9 up to the coveted 4.0. \nThese different types of honors can easily signify your academic achievements and excellence. But first, consider whether to put cum laude on resumes first. \n‍\nShould you add Latin honors to a resume?\nGraduating with Latin honors is a major achievement. But whether that helps you in your job search depends.\nIn general, job seekers may not need to include a particular distinction if they have several years of work history. However, there are situations where it makes sense to list cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude on your resume.\nYou’re a recent graduate. If you recently graduated cum laude or with other Latin honors and are breaking into the workforce for the first time, it can make sense to add them to show your work ethic and your educational achievements in your college career. \nYou’re applying to graduate school. You might want to go straight into graduate school to pursue your master’s or doctorate. If you’re submitting your application to grad school, adding Latin honors shows your commitment to academic pursuits and education. \nYou have limited work experience. You may not have a long work history to show prospective employers. So adding anything that can show your skills and achievements can help. \nYou’re applying for jobs with a focus on education. If you’re applying to be a professor or a position at an academic institution, it makes sense to include your academic honors. Additionally, if you’re applying for positions in law, finance, or management it can distinguish you from other candidates. \nIf you don’t fall into one of these categories, adding your academic honors may be taking up precious space on your resume. While it can signify your academic excellence, employers care more about your work experience and skills. \nIf you've graduated summa cum laude, adding it to on a resume is the most impressive and sets you apart from others. Putting magna cum laude on a resume may also give you a competitive advantage. Putting cum laude on a resume may make sense, but it depends on the school’s criteria. Typically, you only want to include your GPA if it’s 3.5 or above. If your GPA is less than that—even if it meets the cum laude distinction for your school—it’s best to skip it.\nWhere to put cum laude on a resume\nIf you decide to put cum laude on your resume, the best place to put it is in the Education section. It makes the most sense there and can add context to your studies and showcase your academic achievements. \nAlternatively, if you have enough to warrant it, you can include academic awards and honors in a separate Awards and Honors section. What’s a good benchmark? Typically, if you have three or more distinctions and awards, it can justify having a separate awards section or separate honors section. Make sure there’s enough space so it doesn’t detract from your Experience section, which is typically the part of your resume that carries the most weight. \nUsing Teal’s Resume Formatting feature, you can easily add your awards and scholarships with their own section or as an addition to your resume Education section. \n\n‍\nHow to list academic honors on a resume\nAcademic honors can come in different forms. They can include the President’s List, Dean’s List, honor roll, school awards, and Latin honors which are cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude. \nSumma cum laude is often considered the highest honor. Magna cum laude is second in rank “with high honors'' and cum laude third “with honor.”\nPresident’s list and Dean’s list are also based on grades, though President’s list is more prestigious as it typically refers to students with all A’s whereas Dean’s list can be A’s and B’s.\nThe honor roll is next as it’s more lenient with the GPA and then any school awards based on your field of study. So at a glance, the ranking is:\n1. Summa cum laude\n2. Magna cum laude\n3. Cum laude\n4. President’s list\n5. Dean’s list\n6. Honor roll \n7. School awards \nThis matters because you want to list your honors in order of importance. \n‍\nHow to format academic honors on a resume with Teal\nIf you only have one or two academic honors, put them in the Education section of your resume. If you have three or more, consider adding an “Awards and Honors” section or something similar. \nIn Teal, go to the Resume Builder and click on the “Education” section. From there, you can add your degree, GPA, and honors.\n‍\nIf you have several to include, head to the “Awards & Scholarships” section and add them here. Make sure to list academic honors in order of importance, with the most important one at the top, and then in listing in descending order. So if you want to learn how to put honor society on resume or other awards, this is your best strategy.\nThere is also a specific way to format academic honors. In a departure from what you’re probably used to, Latin honors are typically written in lowercase and italics. \nLowercase letters were an evolution of the Latin alphabet based on cursive handwriting. The Chicago Manual of Style recommends using italics for foreign words that are unfamiliar. \nTeal Note: Teal does not currently offer the option to italicize resume words or phrases. And while whether or not you use italics for specific words is unlikely to impact your chances of landing an interview, it’s important to use the format that works best for you.\n‍\nLatin honors on resume examples\nAdding Latin honors on your resume is pretty simple, but there are some formatting rules to take into consideration. \nIn addition to the nuts and bolts of formatting, there are different ways to structure the honors. For example, including it on a separate line or the same line as your degree. Here’s how to put cum laude on a resume.\n‍\nSumma cum laude on resume \nOption #1:\nEducation \n[Degree], [Graduation Year]\n[School]\nHonors: summa cum laude [(GPA)]\n‍\nExample:\nEducation \nBachelor of Science in Engineering, 2018\nColumbia University \nHonors: summa cum laude (3.9)\n‍\nOption #2:\nEducation \n[Degree], summa cum laude \n[School]\n‍\nExample:\nEducation \nBachelor of Science in Engineering, summa cum laude \nColumbia University\n‍\nOption #3:\nEducation \n[School]\n[Degree], summa cum laude \n‍\nExample:\nEducation \nColumbia University\nBachelor of Science in Engineering, summa cum laude \n‍\nMagna cum laude on resume\nOption #1:\nEducation \n[Degree], [Graduation Year]\n[School]\nHonors: magna cum laude [(GPA)]\n‍\nExample:\nEducation \nBachelor of Science in Engineering, 2018\nColumbia University \nHonors: magna cum laude (3.7)\n‍\nOption #2:\nEducation \n[Degree], magna cum laude \n[School]\n‍\nExample:\nEducation \nBachelor of Science in Engineering, magna cum laude \nColumbia University\n‍\nOption #3:\nEducation\n[School]\n[Degree], magna cum laude \n‍\nExample:\nEducation \nColumbia University\nBachelor of Science in Engineering, magna cum laude \n‍\nCommon mistakes to avoid when listing academic honors\nListing summa cum laude or other academic honors should be a plus to your resume, not detract hiring managers or recruiters.\nTo maximize the benefits, here are some common resume mistakes to avoid when you list Latin honors.\nWasting space. Your resume should be between one and three pages long—depending on your level of experience. And it should illustrate your relevant employment history. If adding your academic honors takes up more space or makes your resume excessively long, consider removing them. \nNot relevant. If you’re more than three years out of school or your honors don’t relate to the job, don’t include them. Only include honors if related to your job or as a recent grad with a diploma. \nUsing the wrong format. Avoid capitalizing when listing Latin honors and keeping them as plain text. The recommended format is writing Latin honors in lowercase and with italics.\nCum laude below 3.5 GPA. Some schools may have a cum laude distinction for students with a GPA below 3.5, such as the University of Connecticut, which has a 3.0 threshold. However, the general rule is to only include the GPA on resume if it’s 3.5 or above. \nPro Tip: To help you format your experience and include honors only when relevant, use Teal’s AI Resume Builder to customize each resume.\nWith Teal, you can create a base resume. Then toggle on only the experience and details relevant to each unique job you apply for.\n‍\n‍\nMake the most of academic honors with Teal\nYour academic honors, such as cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude, have a time and place in your resume. These distinctions have the most leverage if you’re new to the workforce or trying to get a job at a university or other field that values education. \nTeal’s Resume Builder and its comprehensive resume sections can help you add Latin honors to your resume without the extra work of manually formatting each section. Then, if you’re applying for a job where the honor isn’t relevant, it’s possible to uncheck that section and create different versions of your resume—without the hassle. \nFrequently Asked Questions\nIs cum laude an achievement?\nDoes adding cum laude make a difference on a resume?\nIs it okay to put honors in a resume?","Meta Description":"Learn how and where to list Cum Laude honors on your resume to highlight your academic excellence effectively."}}]}

But what’s your resume’s first impression? Put simply, what’s the very first thing hiring managers see when they decide to open and review your document?\nIt’s your resume file name. That seemingly inconsequential job search detail carries a surprising amount of weight in getting your resume noticed—and making a good impression when that happens.\nThis guide digs into the details of why your resume’s file name matters, what makes for a good resume file name, examples to show you the way, and plenty more.\nKeep track of all your resume versions with Teal's  resume creator. Stay organized, avoid confusion, and send the right document with every application.\n‍\nWhy your resume file name matters\nUnderstandably, you focus a lot of time, energy, and attention on the content of your resume. From including relevant keywords to polishing every last letter, the meat of your resume is where the bulk of the work happens.\nThat makes it easy to overlook the importance of what you name your resume file. But, taking a nonchalant approach to file names increases confusion and can also hinder your chances of success in your job search.\n‍\nYour resume file name is important because it:\nHelps you get noticed: While hiring professionals searching an applicant tracking system (ATS) are generally more focused on the content of your resume, a clear and professional file name can work in your favor. It ensures your resume is easily identifiable—potentially giving you a slight edge in the initial screening process.\nKeeps you more organized: An adequate file name not only makes your resume easier to find for a hiring manager but also for you personally. When you’re applying for multiple positions, you quickly end up with a desktop covered in different resume documents. Naming them clearly helps you find and send the correct resume to the correct employer.\nDemonstrates professionalism: The job listing might note a specific file name for candidates to use. Honoring those directions shows your keen attention to detail. Additionally, a clean and consistent file name format (one you use not only for your resume but for your cover letter and other application materials) helps you make your most polished and professional impression.\n‍\nWhat to name your resume: Resume file naming best practices\nYou’re convinced that when you make a resume your file name matters, but how do you get it right? Here’s what you need to know to name your resume file and stand out (in a good way) during the hiring process.\n‍\nResume file name template\nHere’s the first question most candidates have: What information should you include in your resume file name? This can vary based on the employer and whether or not they noted specific directions in the job description.\n‍\nIn general, your file name should include:\nYour first and last name\nThe job title you’re applying for\nThe word “resume”\nThose three key pieces of information immediately tell the employer who you are, what you’re applying for, and what your document is—without them even having to open your resume and review all the words.\nThe single most important aspect of your resume file name is your name. So, list that first and separate words with a hyphen or underscore.\n‍\nHere’s a resume file name template you can follow:\n[First Name]_[Last Name]_[Job Title]_[Resume]\n‍\nAnd here’s an example of what that template looks like when it’s filled in for a candidate named John Smith:\nJohn_Smith_Senior_Software_Engineer_Resume\n‍\nYou can use that same format for your cover letter and other application materials. You’ll simply swap the word “resume” to indicate the content of the document:\nJohn_Smith_Senior_Software_Engineer_Cover_Letter\nJohn_Smith_Senior_Software_Engineer_Work_Samples\n‍\nFor both your resume and cover letter, your file name will also have an extension at the end, such as .pdf, .doc, or .docx, to indicate your resume’s file type. When in doubt, a resume PDF is your safest bet for your file format.\n‍\nResume file naming tips\nFollowing that simple template goes a long way in writing a clear and concise file name, but here are a few more tips to treat your file name as a small but powerful detail that can separate you from other applicants.\n‍\nRead the application directions carefully\nIn some cases, employers detail specific instructions for how they want you to name your resume. They might need that to comply with their computer systems or make it easier for them to track job applications. For example, they could ask you to include a job identification number rather than a position title. Follow those directions to the letter. Your file name isn’t your opportunity to get creative.\n‍\nAvoid special characters\nYou can use underscores or hyphens to separate pieces of information. But beyond that, avoid other special characters and emojis. They not only clutter your file name but also could make your resume incompatible with different computer systems employers use.\n‍\nKeep it concise\nIdeally, your resume file name should be around five words. A lengthy file name like “Jane_Smith_Sales_Territory_Manager_Resume_CompanyXYZ_ID29847_08-21-2024.pdf” is overwhelming and difficult to read. The only time your file name should be this long is if the employer specifically asked you to include all of this information.\n‍\nHow to name your resume file\nWhen you’ve landed on the right name for your resume, it’s time to figure out how to actually change and save your resume’s file name. Here’s how.\n‍\nHow to name a resume file in Microsoft Word\nIf you’ve created your resume as a Word document, you’ll name your resume when you save it:\nClick “File” > “Save As”\nEnter your resume file name in the “Save As” field\nSelect your desired file format and where you want your resume saved on your computer‍\nHow to name a resume file in Google Docs\nIn Google Docs, click the title bar at the very top of the page (it’ll say “Untitled document” if you haven’t previously entered a title). Type in your file name information, and it will save automatically.\nAlternatively, you can click “File” and “Rename” to edit the name of your document.\n‍\nHow to name an existing resume file on a desktop\nAlready saved your resume document to your desktop? Don’t worry—it’s still easy to change the file name. Right click on the document, select “Rename,” and then type in the new name of your file.\n‍\nHow to name a resume file using a resume builder\nNaming or renaming a resume file in Teal’s Resume Builder is straightforward. Press the button to create a new resume or open one of your existing resumes. Click the title at the top of the page and then enter your information. \n\n‍\nWhen you export your Teal resume as a PDF, it will automatically export using the name you’ve set there. Additionally, naming your resumes clearly makes it way easier to identify specific resume versions on your master list of resumes.\n‍\nExamples of good and bad resume file names\nHere’s a look at some examples of well-written resume file names—as well as some that will inevitably make employers roll their eyes.\n‍\nWell-named resume files\n\nWhy it works: This resume file name incorporates all of the best practices. It showcases the candidate’s full name first, lists the exact position title as it appears in the job description, incorporates the word “resume,” and separates information with underscores (rather than other special characters).\n‍\nWhy it works: This example includes the applicant’s full name and the word “resume” for clarity. However, this hypothetical job listing asked candidates to include the job ID number in the file name rather than the position title—and this candidate honored the employer’s directions.\n‍\nPoorly-named resume files\nWhat to fix: While this file name includes the word “resume,” it skips other pertinent information like the applicant’s name and the position title. Additionally, it includes unnecessary information the employer doesn’t need (like the date and time the resume was created), and details aren’t clearly separated.\n‍\n‍What to fix: All of the must-have details are there, but this resume file name is way too long and includes far too much information. Additionally, it incorporates special characters that might be unreadable by different platforms. The only reason your file name should be this long is if the employer explicitly asked you to include all of this information when naming your document.\n‍\nHow to manage multiple resume files\nWhen you’re job searching, it’s not long before you end up with dozens of different resume files and versions in a jumbled mess on your desktop—many of which are only slightly different from each other.\nFortunately, Teal’s Resume Builder with version management makes it way easier to track and manage all of your resume documents.\n‍\nIn Teal, you can:\nUse the checkboxes to quickly add or remove information from a resume—rather than starting from scratch each time.\n‍\nEasily duplicate a resume that you can adjust and name accordingly.\n‍\nAutomatically update different versions of your resume when working on one of your files. For example, if you change your address, you can apply that update across all of your resumes within Teal. Learn more in this video tutorial.\n‍\nSee all of your resumes listed in one spot. You can see all of your file names as well as other information, like the job you wrote the resume for and the date you created it. Sort your different resumes by clicking the arrows on the column titles.\n‍\nUse Teal to manage your resumes with more clarity and less chaos\nIt’s easy for your file name to become an afterthought when writing your resume. But that seemingly trivial detail can have a huge impact on a prospective employer’s perceptions and your own ability to stay organized.\nUse this guide to choose the right file names for your resumes, and you’ll set yourself up for a far more successful (and less stressful) job search. \nTracking and managing your resume files doesn’t need to be so complicated.

But for those still early in their careers, applying for internships, or seeking employment in certain STEM careers, a good GPA carries more weight. In fact, there are some industries that won’t consider your resume unless it includes a grade point average.\nThis guide covers when to add GPA on a resume and how to format it.\n‍\nNeed to format your GPA on a resume? Make a free resume in Teal and get it just right—without the manual work.\n‍\nWhen should you put your GPA on your resume? \nYou’ve probably seen conflicting advice on including GPA on your resume. Many will say you absolutely need it, especially if you’re early in your career.\nOthers will disagree. Just look at this Reddit thread: \n‍\nAccording to Masoud Ardestani, co-founder and CEO of recruiting platform Rapha,“GPAs don’t matter whatsoever.”\nLynda Spiegel, human resources professional and career coach, turns the question around, “Why would you put your GPA on your resume?”\nUnless it’s asked of you in the job description, you’re better off without it. \n“As a human resources professional, I can tell you that GPA tells me only one thing: how good [of] a student you were. That means little about how good [of] an employee you would be.”\nStill not sure? Here are the four factors to consider when determining whether or not to include GPA on your resume:\n‍\n1. Industry\nYour GPA is far more relevant in industries like government, education, engineering, science, or other STEM-related professions. Even then, it’s highly dependent on the organization’s policy and your specific role. \nFor example, your GPA may matter more when applying to teaching positions than for IT roles in the same district. As a teacher, the school would want to confirm competency in a subject.\nTeachers in some states are required to submit the transcript for their coursework and certifications to the state education department and human resources with their prospective employer.\nSome defense contractors require no less than a 3.5 GPA for entry-level positions. \nGovernment is a toss up. You will likely find that about half of the government jobs you apply for require college transcripts with your application and want to see GPA on your resume.\n‍\n2. Internships and student programs\nSome programs and internships span several years and are meant to lead to permanent positions within the company, so they’re strict on GPA maintenance for students. \nGenerally, they’ll require a GPA above 3.0, as you can see from these popular internship programs:\nCensus Bureau internship program\nStryker internship program\nFBI Honors internship program\nTypically, if it dips below the 3.0 GPA requirement, you’re given a semester to rebuild. If you can’t get it back above the minimum, you’re relieved from the program. \n‍\n3. Experience level\nEarly career positions are the exception to the rule. \nBecause you have limited work experience, employers have a harder time judging whether or not you can do the job. Fair or not, they may look at your GPA as an indicator of work ethic. \nIn this case, employers will simply want to see your GPA is respectable and that you meet all of the basic requirements for the position. Once you’re past that initial check, they’re unlikely to ask about your GPA in interviews.\n‍\n4. GPA strength\nIf you have a very high GPA (3.5 or higher) and you’re new to the workforce, you may be eager to add it to your resume. \nUnsurprisingly, most hiring managers believe adding a GPA lower than 3.5 to your resume is a mistake.\nSief Khafagi, a Facebook recruiter, advises to “leave your GPA off, unless it’s near [the] top of your class.” \nHe goes on to mention you can replace your GPA and other education details with technologies you’re comfortable with, as long as you don’t go overboard. \nCaitlin Proctor, a certified professional resume writer and career expert at ZipJob, believes there’s more to lose than gain from including your GPA on a resume:\n“My advice would be to leave your GPA off. Ultimately, the exclusion of your GPA from a resume isn’t going to make or break your job search. However, including it could absolutely cost you an interview. \nBy the time you get to the interview process, you should be able to develop some kind of narrative around why your GPA is lower. \nIf it’s a factor that may remove you from the list of applicants, you can offset it with references, a good school, internships, and letters of recommendation. If those internships have given you a good basis of work in the field, you can use that to demonstrate your knowledge and experience as well. \nUltimately, skills trump grades in the corporate world, according to Proctor:\n“While most companies would rather see achievements that demonstrate skills like teamwork and leadership, the ones who care about GPA will ask you about it.”\n‍\nHow to list your GPA on your resume\nYou’ve probably started browsing resume templates and examples of resumes on Google images or Pinterest, and you’ve seen so many different ways of listing your education on your resume. \nUnfortunately, as flashy and visually appealing as some of those resumes are, they’re not always readable. ATS systems- which automatically check your resume against the company’s job listing- aren’t always able to read resumes that aren’t formatted correctly.\nFor reference, this is what the average education section should look like on your resume:\nBelow you’ll see where to place your GPA on your resume, and how to format your education section if you have more than the average qualifications. \n‍\nWhere does your GPA belong on your resume?\nAfter you graduate, your GPA should sit at the bottom of your resume alongside your major and college, in one of the most important parts of a resume for new graduates, your education section. \nHowever, if you’re a recent graduate, you’ll want to include your education section, including your GPA, at the top of your resume, just beneath the professional statement. \n‍\nHow to format your GPA on a resume\nStudent applying for graduate school example\nWhere you put your GPA on your resume and the best resume format to use depends on whether you’re still a student or if you’ve graduated.\nIf you’re still in school, add your education details at the top of your resume, just under your contact details and resume summary.\nThe amount of information you add varies, depending on if you:\nWent to a top tier school\nWere in a prestigious or competitive program\nHave a high GPA (magna cum laude, summa cum laude)\nIf you received relevant certifications or awards\nYour GPA looks best when kept simple and neat, with only the most basic information included.\nIf you have additional credentials you’d like to add, such as a college program or dean’s list, you’d list the information in this order:\nYour alma mater\nYour degree\nYour major and program track\nGPA\nCredentials and awards\nYears of attendance\nIf you’ve had some incredible achievements while in school, you might want to include them. Consider the following examples:\nA fundraiser you organized\nA capstone project\nAwards you’ve won\nElections directly related to the position you’re applying for\nIf you don’t have a lot of experience on your resume, additional achievements, credentials, and awards can help to offset that inexperience. \nIt can also help to offset a lower GPA, if you’re required to add it to your resume.\nSome resume templates shift the years of attendance and your GPA to the right side of the page, separating it from the rest of your education section. \nThis may have some implications on the readability of your resume by applicant tracking system (ATS) software, which scans for resume keywords and qualifications that help recruiters find the best candidate matches.\nAdd Keywords to Your Resume\n‍\n‍\nGPA on resume examples\nKeep your education section simple. It should be easy for both the hiring manager (or employer) and the ATS to read. Use proper punctuation to separate items all on one line. \nIf you’re required to put your GPA on your resume, add it next to your university location in the education section.\n‍\nGPA on resume example 1\nIf you’re new to the job market, your education section should sit just below your professional statement, like so:\n\nWhy this format works:\nWhile short, this is all that’s required of most resumes. It isn’t flashy, but it’s readable, clear, and lists all the details the resume reviewer needs.\n‍\nGPA on resume example 2\nIf you have other credentials or awards in conjunction with your high GPA that you want to feature, especially those that align with the position, you might want to add those details as well. Here’s how to do that:\n\nWhy this format works:\nWhile you have all of the general education listed in a standard format, additional details should be listed as resume bullet points below. \n‍\nWhy this format works:\nMaking valedictorian is no easy feat. Calling out only the most important grade-related achievements as bullets keeps the education section short and sweet. \nIn addition, this example incorporates collegiate awards and involvement into other sections. This way they’re able to talk to each bullet point more than if they were in the same section.\nIf you have no work experience, or that experience is limited, this is a great way to demonstrate similar experience through school projects and programs.\nCheck out more tips on crafting a student resume.\n‍\nHow to put GPA on your resume using Teal\nIf you’ve done any job hunting and have had to create a resume, you know how absolutely daunting it can be to create a resume from scratch. \nThe constant reformatting, rewriting, copying and pasting of sections is arguably the worst part of the application process.\nBut with Teal, you don’t have to think about whether your GPA is in the right spot.

Using the XYZ resume format can help you do that.\nIn this article you’ll learn the Google XYZ formula and how to properly use it on your resume.\nWant to create a resume that stands out using Google's XYZ format? Make a resume with achievement-focused bullet points using Teal's free AI Resume Builder.\n‍\nWhat is the XYZ resume format?\nThe XYZ resume format is a specific resume writing formula recommended by Google to highlight accomplishments. The formula is “Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z],” as outlined by Laszlo Bock, a former Google Senior Vice President of People Operations. \nUse this specific XYZ formula in bullet points to list your achievements. Doing so shows your skills with conviction and context. \nFor example, instead of saying you “increased sales,” use the XYZ structure:\nIncreased sales (X) by 25% (Y) by launching a new line of business in Q1 (Z). \nThis example uses numbers to highlight how much you increased sales and also includes the “how.”\nFormat Your Resume for Free\n‍\nWho should use the Google XYZ resume format?\nBecause it provides a clear and concise way of sharing what you’ve done, the XYZ resume format is an effective resume method for anyone on the job search. But those looking for roles in tech, startups, or sales, may find it easiest to communicate their experience and expertise with this formula. \nStephanie Alston, president at BGG Enterprises, a recruitment agency shared who should use this formula and how it can help:\n“Use this format when you have specific results to show from your past jobs, like increasing sales, improving efficiency, or completing projects. It’s great for roles where your accomplishments can be measured.” \n‍\nGoogle recruiters recommended the XYZ method on resumes as a way to stand out and bring your resume to the top. Google sometimes receives 50 thousand resumes in a single week, many from highly qualified tech workers. So this advice carries a lot of weight and can help job applicants in a variety of fields quantify their achievements and communicate them succinctly.\nWrite Resume Achievements with AI\n‍\n‍\nBenefits of using the XYZ resume format\nThere are many benefits to using the XYZ format on your resume:\nQuantifies your accomplishments with tangible metrics\nProvides additional context  \nIncludes how you accomplished a task\nReads better\nDemonstrates impact\n“This approach is helpful because it clearly shows employers what you’ve achieved and how you did it, making your resume more impactful and you more marketable as a job applicant,” says Alston of the XYZ resume format.\n‍\nWhen to use the XYZ resume format\nThe XYZ resume method is good for job seekers in fields where accomplishments are easily quantifiable. So if you’re in healthcare, marketing, sales, business, engineering, consulting, or customer service, you likely have metrics to draw on that would make the XYZ resume format a good option. \nIn these job types, hitting certain targets is how you show your success in the role. So think about which outcomes are the most impactful to share based on the job description. \nSome common metrics to use on a resume:\nRevenue increases\nReducing expenses \nTime saved\nSales increases\nUser acquisition \nProfit increases\nConversions \nReturn on investment\nTotal output\n‍\nYou can also use the XYZ method on your resume if you’re a recent graduate or pivoting into a new career.\nIf you don’t have much job experience to list, you can use the formula with your educational achievements. If you’re looking for a career change, the XYZ structure can help you highlight your transferable skills. \nThough you may want to use the Google XYZ resume format on every resume, each one should be customized to the role using keywords from the job description. Luckily, you can do that with little time and effort using the Matching Mode feature in Teal’s Resume Builder, which helps you create a resume that’s aligned with the job description by recommending relevant keywords for your resume and grading your resume’s relevance to the open role.\nTailor Your Resume to Any JD\n‍\nFor more insights on resume formats, check out this guide on the best resume format.\n‍\nHow to write an XYZ resume\nSimilar to the CAR method resume format, the XYZ resume writing method is a way to level up your accomplishments and quickly and clearly show results and impact. When you have a matter of seconds to grab the attention of a hiring manager, resume writing matters. Here is how you can take advantage of this compelling, Google-recommended format and write an XYZ resume.\n‍\n1. Start with the formula \nThe Google XYZ formula is: Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]\nUse this structure when writing bullet points under the jobs listed in the Experience section of your resume.\n‍\n2. Take an inventory\nThe XYZ structure focuses on your achievements, metrics, and how you did it. To help you write each bullet point, take an inventory of the accomplishments you can quantify.\nDo this for each job. You’ll likely want to revise these points based on the job you’re applying for so they’re relevant. Write down the achievement (X) and the metric (Y). Start each sentence with an action verb and make sure to use a number for every metric. \n‍\n3. Write bullet points for each job \nThe next part is putting the XYZ format into action. You want to connect the X and Y from step two and add Z to paint a complete picture.\nHere are some examples of the XYZ resume format:\n‍\nMarketing manager \nIncreased page views (X) by 23% (Y) in six months by implementing social media distribution strategies (Z). \nReduced ad spend (X) by 30% (Y) by improving customer targeting (Z).\nSales specialist\nIncreased conversions (X) by 28% (Y) after training five new team members (Z). \nLaunched a new product (X) that led to a 15% profit increase in Q1 (Y) by engaging newsletter subscribers (Z). \nCustomer service \nReduced errors (X) by 40% (Y) after creating a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document (Z). \nIncreased customer satisfaction (X) by 18% (Y) by implementing survey feedback (Z). \n‍\nGo through this exercise for each position listed on your resume. This will enable you to highlight your successes while sharing your experience. Once you have the sentences ready for each job, include them as bullet points under each job title in the experience section of your resume. \nTo easily list your results-driven achievements, use Teal’s AI Resume Builder. You can simply provide your LinkedIn URL and create a resume you can revise from there.\n‍\n‍\nHow to format an XYZ Resume\nThere are many ways to craft a resume. The XYZ format on a resume is different from standard resumes as it focuses on your accomplishments with metrics and processes using a specific formula. In addition to providing the XYZ formula, Google provided several formatting recommendations in their YouTube video on how to create a resume for Google. \n‍\n‍\nIf you want to use this method, here’s how to format an XYZ resume:\n1. Create the right order of sections \nGoogle recruiters recommend you include the following sections:\nExperience\nLeadership and Awards\nEducation\nOptional section \n‍\nThis is the go-to format if you’re a professional with several years of experience under your belt. If you’re a recent graduate, Google recommends putting the Education section up top. So the order would be:\nEducation\nExperience\nLeadership and Awards\nOptional section \n‍\nInclude your GPA, graduation date, or expected graduation date if you’re still a student. If you don’t have much experience to list, consider using the XYZ resume structure in the education section to highlight some of your accomplishments in school. \nFor the optional section, you can choose something relevant to your experience or a good match for the role you want. Some options can include projects, publications, or even extracurricular activities.\n‍\n2. Include XYZ formula bullet points under Experience \nThe Google XYZ resume formula should be primarily applied to the Experience section. Include bullet points using the specific formula under your job title, employer, and employment dates. \nUse relevant keywords from the job posting in the formula. Make sure to begin with action words, then a numeral, and how you accomplished your achievement. If you’re stuck, review these 250 action verbs for inspiration. Each bullet point should follow the XYZ resume format and span one line. \n‍\nExperience\nSocial Media Marketer, Agency | October 2021 - present\nIncreased social media impressions by 35% by creating and posting to IG Reels and TikTok. \nReduced planning time by 5 hours per week by implementing a content calendar and scheduling posts.\n‍\n3. List experience in reverse-chronological order \nUse reverse-chronological order when listing your experience and job history on your resume. That means listing your current, or most recent, position first, then going further as you go down the page. Formatting your resume in reverse-chronological order shows potential employers what you’re doing now, while also sharing your job history and skills you’ve achieved in the past.\n‍\nReverse-chronological order resume template:\n[Current position] [Current employer] [Month/year start date - present]\n[Position before that] ][Previous employer] [Month/year - Month/year]\n‍\n4. Keep the style consistent\nTo follow the XYZ resume guidelines, choose a consistent style for your resume. That means using the same font and size throughout your resume. \nUsing an 11-point or 12-point size font is ideal. Additionally, these font styles are widely used on resumes:\nArial\nCambria\nGaramond\nTimes New Roman \nAdditionally, it’s best to use black or dark text. The main thing is to keep the font, size, and color uniform. The text should look clean and organized with enough white space. Most importantly, it should be easy to read.\n‍\n5. Review for resume red flags \nWhen all the information is in place, review your resume carefully. You want to avoid resume red flags that can immediately take you out of the running. These can include:\nTypos\nGrammatical errors \nNot including contact information\nIncluding confidential information about a company \nAlso, double-check for accuracy. You want to present yourself in the best light for potential hiring managers and employers. But fibbing about certain parts of your experience is a big no-no.\n‍\n6. Finalize resume \nThere are a lot of thoughts on what file type your resume should be or how many pages it should be. \nIn Google’s YouTube video on resume tips for applying for a job at the multibillion-dollar company, a clear preference is stated: A one-page PDF.\nIf you have a lot of technical skills and an extensive job history, you may get away with a two-page resume. But if you can make it into a succinct one-page PDF, even better. \nTo help you write your achievements using the XYZ format, use Teal’s AI Achievement Assistant.\n‍\n\n‍\nFor example, here’s an example of achievements written by AI. Then you can edit and customize to fit your resume and use the XYZ formula. \n\nYou can also add keywords, input the job description, or use a custom prompt to help. \n‍\n\n‍\nIf you're new to resume creation, read this guide on how to make a resume.\n‍\nXYZ resume example\nHere’s an XYZ resume example using the formula. You see accomplishments up front, the quantifiable measurement, and finally how it was done. This example is full of various metrics and real data, illustrating impact and outcomes. \nXYZ resume template\nIf you want to use the XYZ resume format recommended by Google recruiters, here’s a template of which sections to include and where to put the XYZ formula: \n‍\nName Github profile (if applicable)\nEmail address Programming languages (if applicable)\nExperience\nJob title 1/Employer 1 Month Year - Present\nXYZ formula\nXYZ formula\nXYZ formula\nJob title 2/Employer 2 Month Year - Month Year \nXYZ formula\nXYZ formula\nXYZ formula\nJob title 3/Employer 3 Month Year - Month Year \nXYZ formula\nXYZ formula \nXYZ formula\nLeadership and awards\nEducation \nOptional final section\n‍\nTips and best practices for an XYZ resume\nCustomize bullet points. Every job is different. Be sure to customize your bullet points using the XYZ method on your resume based on the job description. Some achievements may be relevant for one position but not another. It may also need a little tweaking to make sure it fits. Keep each bullet to one line. \nCheck for keywords. Match the language in the job description. The posting is like a dating profile sharing who and what they’re looking for. Using relevant keywords mirrors back to them you’re the right fit for the role. Doing so can also help your resume make it past applicant tracking systems (ATS). In Teal’s Resume Builder, use Matching Mode to make this step easy.\nReview spelling and grammar. Do a simple spell check. You want to get rid of any misspellings, omitted words, and double words and check for context as homonyms can sneak through. Additionally, look at your grammar. You can use Teal’s Resume Checker to find typos, fix structure, and optimize your resume’s score. You can also highlight your text and have it read aloud. If you have a Mac, highlight your text and then press “Option” + “Esc.” You’ll hear the text read aloud for you, which can help you hear errors your tired eyes might not see. \nCheck format. Google recommends candidates use a one-page PDF when submitting resumes for a job at the company. If you go beyond one page, make sure it’s worth it.  \nIf you're considering a longer resume, read this post on two-page resumes can provide valuable insights.\n‍\nWrite a Google-approved XYZ resume \nIf you want to work for Google—or appeal to other FAANG tech enterprises—it makes sense to follow the Google XYZ resume format. Think of it this way, the company is telling you how to succeed with your resume and have the best shot of advancing. \nIn the YouTube video about resume tips, it’s stated that Google makes cover letters optional and your resume is the main focus. In other words, your resume needs to do the heavy lifting to showcase your skills. So follow their XYZ resume format exactly to increase your chances of landing a job interview. \nEven if you’re not applying for a job at Google, the XYZ resume format can provide a compelling and easy-to-use formula that may give you an edge. Having a well-structured and achievement-oriented resume can make the most of the little space you have.\nIf you want to utilize one of the best tools out there to help write your resume, use Teal’s AI Resume Builder. It gives an analysis score, so you can see that you have the right keywords related to the job description. Plus, you can use AI Achievements to write effective bullet points perfect for the XYZ resume format.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the Google XYZ resume?\nWhat are the three resume format types?\nWhat is the most successful resume format?"}}]}

These skills are valuable in a wide range of contexts, helping you connect, collaborate, and navigate challenges effectively.\n‍\nWhat are resume soft skills?\nResume soft skills are the personal traits and abilities you showcase on your resume to demonstrate how you work with others, solve problems, and adapt to different situations. \nThese skills—sometimes called transferable skills—such as teamwork, communication, and leadership, complement your technical qualifications and help employers understand how you perform in collaborative and dynamic environments. Including soft skills on your resume highlights the value you bring beyond just your technical expertise.\n‍\nSoft skills vs. hard skills \nIn contrast to resume soft skills, hard skills are more specific abilities that can be defined and measured. \nSometimes called technical skills, hard skills often refer to technical knowledge or training necessary to perform particular jobs in specific industries. (For example, Google Suite, Salesforce, Python, data analysis, or accounting.) \n‍\nWhy are soft skills important?\nSoft skills are important because they help you navigate relationships, lead teams, and contribute to your overall impact—no matter your field or industry.\nWhile technical skills show how you accomplish tasks, soft skills—like communication, work ethic, and emotional intelligence—are what really drive your success. These personal attributes shape how you interact, solve problems, and adapt to different situations.\n‍\nFor example:\nLeadership skills can help you move software development projects forward, while problem-solving sparks innovation in science.\n\nStrong communication skills enable collaboration in education, and adaptability helps administrative professionals handle shifting tasks.\n\nTime management improves productivity, and integrity fosters trust across teams.\n‍\nTypes of soft skills\nUnderstanding how soft skills break down into different groups can help you identify the types of skills you already have and where you have opportunities for growth. \n‍\nCommunication soft skills\nCommunication skills are integral in nearly every professional setting. They facilitate a clear and effective exchange of information, ideas, and emotions. \nVerbal communication is used to relay information or share your point of view.\nNon-verbal communication involves body language, facial expressions, and other forms of physical presentation to complement verbal communication. \nWritten communication is how you craft words to deliver information—crucial for persuasive copy, effective emails, reports, proposals, and more.\n‍\nProblem-solving soft skills\nProblem-solving skills refer to approaching difficulties or complications and finding effective solutions. \nThese core skills involve critical thinking, analysis, creativity, resilience, and decision-making. And they're valuable because they allow you to successfully tackle obstacles and find solutions to complete projects and tasks.\n‍\nLeadership soft skills\nLeadership and management skills involve guiding, directing, and influencing others toward a common goal. \nLeaders need a mix of soft skills to inspire trust, motivate teams, delegate tasks, and make strategic decisions. Key leadership skills include emotional intelligence (EQ), conflict resolution, coaching, and strong communication skills. \n‍\nTeamwork soft skills\nCan you work effectively and peacefully with others? If so, your strong teamwork and collaboration skills can bring people together to achieve shared goals. In fact, there are few professional settings that don't require some semblance of cooperative dynamics. \nSo what does that look like?\nTeamwork and collaboration skills involve active listening, communicating clearly, cooperation, being open to feedback, and successfully managing conflicts. \n‍\nCreativity soft skills\nCreativity and innovation skills involve the ability to think outside the box, come up with new ideas, and approach problems from different angles.\nAnd while these skills are valuable for traditionally 'creative' roles, such as graphic designers or copywriters—they're also becoming increasingly important in many roles and industries as companies strive to differentiate themselves from the competition.\n‍\nWhere to put soft skills on a resume\nSoft skills can be incorporated into multiple sections of your resume to highlight your strengths effectively. These skills help to round out your qualifications and show how you work with others and handle different situations.\nYou can mention them in your professional summary, work experience, and Skills section to ensure they’re easily visible to recruiters. That said, the skills you list—regardless of where—should always be relevant to the job you’re applying for.\n‍\nHere’s where you can place relevant soft skills in your resume:\nProfessional summary\nWork experience\nSkills section\nBelow, you’ll learn how to list them in each of these areas.\n‍\nHow to list soft skills on a resume\nListing soft skills on your resume throughout sections offers a more holistic view of your capabilities and strengths. \nBut as soft skills aren’t measurable, weaving them in with hard skills and impact adds depth and shows how you used them. This approach helps demonstrate your well-rounded qualifications while still addressing how you’ve achieved success and delivered results. \n‍\nProfessional Summary \nIncorporate soft skills in your professional summary or short professional bio seamlessly with your technical skills and achievements. This gives hiring managers an immediate sense of how you approach your work and interact with others. \n‍\nHere's a simple template to guide you:\n[Job title] with [# of years] of experience in [industry or field], skilled in [hard skill], [hard skill], and [soft skill]. Known for using [soft skill] and [hard skill] to [key achievement with impact], with a focus on [result or goal relevant to the job].\n‍\nWork experience\nIn your Work Experience section, you can blend soft skills on a resume with your accomplishments to show how they’ve contributed to tangible results. \nInstead of listing tasks, highlight how your soft skills—like leadership, problem-solving, or communication—played a role in achieving outcomes. This gives context to your contributions and demonstrates your ability to apply both technical expertise and interpersonal skills in real-world scenarios.\n‍\nTry this formula for one work experience bullet:\n[Action verb] + [Hard skill] + [Soft skill] + [Strategy] to [ measurable result or outcome] with [specific impact or success metric].\n‍\nSkills Section\nWhile a dedicated Skills section can effectively highlight hard and soft skills, it’s important to make sure these skills are woven throughout the rest of your resume so they come to life beyond a soft skills list.\nUsing bullet points or separating skills by commas in this section can call attention to your diverse range of abilities.\n‍\nHowever, good soft skills for a resume don't just sit on the page. Incorporating these skills in your Work Experience, Professional Summary, and other sections shows how you apply them in real-world scenarios. A dedicated Skills section provides a snapshot of your technical expertise and interpersonal abilities, but the rest of your resume should back it up with context and achievements.\n‍\nResume soft skills examples\nBelow, you'll find examples of soft skills tailored to specific sections of your resume. These examples will guide you on how to effectively integrate them into your Professional Summary, Work Experience, and Skills sections.\n‍\nSoft skills in a professional summary\nIf a job description lists “detail-oriented,” an example of how to incorporate that into your professional summary could look like: \nDetail-oriented and highly organized Project Manager with 15+ years of experience orchestrating successful projects and delivering them within strict timelines and budgets, resulting in an average cost savings of 10% per project.\n‍\nSoft skills in a Work Experience section\nUsing the template above, soft skills in your resume bullet points can look like:\n• Led project management and cross-functional collaboration to complete a major initiative 2 weeks ahead of schedule, resulting in a 20% increase in productivity.\n• Utilized data analysis and problem-solving to identify inefficiencies in the supply chain, reducing operational costs by 15% and improving overall workflow.\n• Managed customer relations and implemented CRM tools, increasing customer retention by 30% and driving a 10% revenue growth.\n‍\nSoft skills in a Skills section\nKeeping in mind the rest of these skills are sprinkled throughout the other sections of a resume, a Skills section that incorporates soft skills could look like this:\n• Cross-functional collaboration\n• Data analysis\n• Editing\n• Google Analytics\n• Miro\n• Relational leadership\n• SEO\n\n‍\nSoft skills examples by profession\nUltimately, soft skills are vital in just about every job and in every sector. And much like resume strengths, they can complement your biggest career wins.\nSo let’s take a look at some top soft skills examples from across professions and industries that impact relationships, work ethic, productivity, performance, and success.\n‍\nCustomer service soft skills\nActive listening\nAdaptability\nComposure\nConflict resolution\nCultural sensitivity\nDependability\nDiplomacy\nEmotional intelligence (EQ)\nEmpathy\nEnthusiasm\nFlexibility\nInterpersonal skills\nMultitasking\nOptimism\nPatience\nPersuasiveness\nPositivity\nRespect\nResponsiveness\nStress management\n‍\nHealthcare soft skills\nAnalytical skills \nAssertiveness\nAttention to detail\nCompassion\nDedication\nDecision making\nDexterity\nEndurance\nFocus\nHygiene\nMedical ethics\nPhysical stamina\nPrecision\nProblem sensitivity\nQuick thinking \nReliability\nResilience\nSympathy\nTact\nVigilance\nWellness\n‍\nMarketing soft skills\nAdaptability to Change\nAudience understanding (specific to your industry or target audience)\nBranding expertise\nConceptual thinking\nCreativity\nCritical thinking\nConsumer behavior understanding\nData-driven decision making\nDigital media\nExperimentation\nFlexibility\nInitiative\nMarket knowledge (specific to your market)\nNetworking\nOrganizational skills\nProject management\nRisk-taking\nStorytelling\nStrategic thinking\nTrend awareness\nVision\n‍\nManagement soft skills\nActive listening skills\nBudgeting\nBusiness acumen\nChange management\nCoaching\nDelegating\nEvaluation\nFinancial literacy\nGoal-setting or goal-oriented \nInnovation\nInspiring\nLeadership skills\nMentoring\nMotivation\nOrganization\nPerformance management\nResource management\nRisk identification\nStrategic planning\nTalent management\nTeam building\n‍\n‍\nEducation soft skills\nAssessment skills (educational and personal)\nClassroom management\nConflict resolution\nCounseling skills\nCreativity\nCultural sensitivity\nCurriculum development\nEffective knowledge sharing\nInstructional design\nLifelong learning\nMotivation\nPatience\nPresentation skills\nPublic speaking\nRecord keeping\nResearch skills\nStudent engagement\nTime management\nTolerance\nWriting skills\n‍\nSales soft skills\nClosing skills\nCold calling\nCustomer retention\nDirect sales\nFollow-up\nLead generation\nNegotiation\nObjection handling\nOutreach \nPersuasion\nProblem-solving\nRelationship building\nResilience\nSales cycle management\nSelf-motivated \nSocial selling \nStrategic market insight\nStrategic prospecting\nTerritory management\nUpselling\n‍\nDesign soft skills\nAesthetic sense\nArtistic expression\nBrand identity\nCollaborative product development\nColor theory application\nConcept development\nCreative skills\nGraphic design\nIndustrial design\nInnovation\nIntuitive user interface design\nSpatial reasoning\nTypography\nUser-centric design thinking\nUser-centric web design\nUser-centered problem solving\nUser-centered prototyping\nVisualization\nVisual communication\nVisual ideation\n‍\nAccounting soft skills\nConfidentiality\nCritical analysis\nEthical conduct\nFinancial leadership\nForecasting\nInsightful data interpretation\nNumeracy\nOrganizational proficiency\nRegulation awareness\nResource optimization\nSpreadsheet proficiency\nStrategic tax guidance\nTransparent financial reporting\nTreasury knowledge\nTrust building\n‍\nBusiness soft skills\nAttention to detail\nCognitive flexibility\nCommunication\nConceptualization\nCritical thinking\nDocumentation\nEntrepreneurial mindset\nForecasting\nInfluence and persuasion\nIntuition\nPattern recognition\nQuantitative research\nRegression analysis\nStakeholder management\nStatistical analysis\nStorytelling\nStrategic thinking\nSystems analysis\nSystems thinking\n‍\nWeb development soft skills\nAdaptive design thinking\nAesthetic harmony\nCollaboration\nCuriosity\nCybersecurity awareness\nDesign gamification\nDigital story weaving\nEmpathy\nEthical user persuasion\nExperimentation\nFlow state attainment\nGrowth mindset\nIntuitive design sensibility\nOpen-mindedness\nResilience\nStakeholder management\nTechnological intuition\nUser empowerment\nWeb performance artistry\n‍\nHow to highlight resume soft skills with Teal\nThe best practice for adding soft skills to your resume is to incorporate them in each section.

The goal is to present your soft skills in a way that speaks directly to the role you're applying for. Here’s how:\n‍\nReview the job description: Read the JD carefully. Look for keywords or phrases that highlight the soft skills or traits they want. Words like \"team player,\" \"strong communicator,\" \"self-starter,\" and \"problem-solver\" provide insight into what’s expected.\nResearch the company culture: A company’s values and culture can clue you in on the soft skills they prioritize. For example, a company that values innovation might appreciate creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability.\nMatch your skills honestly: Once you’ve identified the key soft skills for the job, align them with your own experience. (But make sure to only include skills that reflect what you bring to the table.)\nQuantify your impact when possible: It’s not always easy to quantify soft skills, but if you can, provide examples of how those skills delivered results. For instance, “Improved team productivity by 20% through effective communication… etc.” shows exactly how your soft skills made a difference.\n‍\nPro Tip: Use Teal’s Job Matching to find good soft skills for resumes and incorporate them into your content for every unique job—without the manual work.\nFind good soft skills for resume sections with Teal's Job Matching\n‍\nResume soft skills to highlight in 2024\nAs industries evolve, certain soft skills can boost your qualifications and demonstrate your fit for a role.

In reality? Not so much.\n\nYou’ve seen the chatter around the importance of personal branding and networking as a part of your job search. LinkedIn plays a huge role in building your professional reputation. It’s not to be neglected.\n\nThe professional social platform has become a go-to community for job seekers and recruiters. But for many reasons, it cannot replace your resume. It complements it and provides a great platform for building your brand—but don’t ditch the resume just yet!\n\nResume vs LinkedIn Profile: Understanding the Difference\nFirst, let’s look at what each of these tools does for you.\n\nLinkedIn is a social media platform for professional networking.\n\nPros\nNetworking: Just about every professional is on LinkedIn, so it’s the best social media platform available for connecting and messaging people in your industry, recruiters, and hiring managers.\nVisibility: Your profile is a marketing tool that helps recruiters find you. \nComprehensive: Unlike a resume, your LinkedIn profile can cover your entire career history without worrying about length. It can also feature more of your thought leadership and successes. For example, you can link articles, portfolios, and more!\nCons\nOne size fits all: Your LinkedIn profile can’t be customized for different audiences. What you see is what you—and recruiters—get. So if you’re applying to jobs in different industries or different job families, your LinkedIn won’t let you tailor a version of your profile to that role.\nFormat limitations: There are a lot more clicks and scrolling to find all the relevant information on a LinkedIn profile compared to a resume. Recruiters don’t like digging. There’s more likely to be irrelevant content in the mix for a recruiter, and that could make it harder for them to match your qualifications to the role. And because you can’t customize the layout, you have less control over what you show them and what’s hidden behind a click. \nEquitable application processes: Most bigger employers want to ensure they have a fair and equitable application process, and that requires consistency. For some, that could mean ensuring they have a resume for every candidate. Some companies even use a “blind” process where names and other identifying information are hidden which may mean they are unable to use a LinkedIn profile.\nResumes are the standard work history document companies ask for in the job application process.\n\nPros\nCustomization: Resumes can be tailored to highlight the most relevant experiences and skills for a specific job.\nClarity and brevity: They allow for concise, focused information that can immediately signal your fit for a role. If you don’t want to include a section, you don’t have to.\nFormality: Resumes remain a staple in traditional hiring processes, expected by most employers.\nCons\nRigidity: Unlike LinkedIn, resumes don't allow for real-time updates or interactions.\nLimited space: The recommendation is one-page resumes for very early career folks and 2 for everyone else (though you are of course free to do a longer resume!) But given that recruiters often spend most of their time on the first page of your resume, you have to be really strategic about condensing your experience down to the most important information. \nStatic: Once sent, a resume doesn't offer the dynamic, public engagement like LinkedIn and other social platforms provide.\nChallenges with LinkedIn Easy Apply feature\nWhile LinkedIn’s Easy Apply button offers a convenient one-click application process, this ease can result in a deluge of applicants—raising the competition and diluting the chances of any one candidate standing out. Although some applications allow you to import your LinkedIn profile, this can require significant editing to fit traditional resume formats, and not everyone wants all of their projects and metrics out for the world to see.\n\nExample of a LinkedIn job posting\nBut most importantly, most job applications still ask for a resume. Ultimately, LinkedIn is a social platform. While employers may want to also take a look at your profile, they will almost always have preference for your resume.\n\nImport Your LinkedIn Profile\n‍\n\n‍Why Your LinkedIn Profile Shouldn’t Replace Your Resume\nLinkedIn has carved out its niche as a professional networking powerhouse, essential for making connections and getting noticed by recruiters. \n\nIntegrating your LinkedIn profile URL and portfolio links into your resume's header alongside other contact information can bolster your application, offering the best of both worlds. However, LinkedIn's format and social nature mean it cannot fully substitute for a tailored resume. Tools like Teal’s LinkedIn Profile review can help optimize your online presence for professional success.\n\n‍\n\nYou Still Need a Resume in 2024!\nThe job market is evolving, and so is the way we apply for jobs. But in 2024, most companies are still looking for a resume as part of the job search. It’s easier for recruiters to quickly scan a resume, and standardized practices are also important from an equity perspective.\n\nA resume also gives you more control to tailor your application to the job as opposed to hoping that a recruiter can connect the dots between your LinkedIn profile and your resume. \n\nThis customization is what helps you demonstrate your fit with a specific job in a way that your LinkedIn may not. Teal’s Design Mode—part of their AI Resume Builder—can help you craft visually appealing resumes that highlight your unique qualifications while still ensuring that your resume is digestible for a recruiter and hiring team!\n\nBuild Your Best Resume\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nBottom line: Use your LinkedIn profile and resume together\nUltimately, the question isn't whether you need a LinkedIn profile or a resume but how best to utilize both in your job search. LinkedIn gives you a platform where you can build your personal brand while networking and marketing yourself to help attract more opportunities. Your resume gives you the opportunity to show how your skills and experiences match the needs of a specific job and company.\n\nAnd in the tough job market of 2024, you need both!\n\nSign Up for Teal, It's Free\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan a LinkedIn profile show tailored experiences for specific job applications like a resume can?\nHow does the level of detail in a LinkedIn profile compare to that of a resume?\nIs it acceptable to just provide a LinkedIn profile URL when a job application asks for a resume?","URL Slug":"need-resume-if-linkedin"}}]}

But with remote work and global hiring on the rise, employers are reviewing more applicants than ever, meaning your CV needs to stand out in content and presentation. A disorganized CV format could cost you an opportunity—no matter how qualified you are. If recruiters can’t quickly grasp your key qualifications, they'll simply move on.\nSo, how do you get it right?\n‍\nIf you want the best CV format for your experience without more research and manual work, try our Resume Builder.\n‍\nUnderstanding the Curriculum Vitae (CV)\nA Curriculum Vitae, or CV, is a record of your academic and professional accomplishments. More than just a high-level account of your qualifications, it’s a comprehensive document that highlights your career history, academic achievements, and specific skills.\nPreviously in the United States, CVs were used in academia, research positions, law, and medicine—where detailed accounts of publications, research, and presentations are necessary.\nBut CVs are not longer limited to those fields.\n‍\nAs the job market becomes more global—with remote work increasing and, according to a survey by Deloitte, 35 percent of organizations allowing employees to work remotely from other countries—employers are hiring candidates from different regions. This shift means more roles are accepting CVs simply because it is often the norm outside of the U.S.\nIn addition to global hiring, CVs are being accepted more widely because they allow applicants to provide a more detailed overview of their qualifications, which is especially valuable in a competitive market or in specialized fields that require more depth, expertise, and industry-specific knowledge.\n‍\nDifferences between a CV and a resume\nThough often used interchangeably, a CV and a resume serve different purposes.\nA resume is a more concise summary of your work experience and skills, tailored for a specific job and typically running one to three pages. While still tailored to every unique job, a CV is a more exhaustive document that provides a deeper look at your academic and professional achievements.‍\nWhen and why to use a CV\nIf you fall outside of any of the industries above and are applying within the U.S. market, use a CV when you are:\nRequired by a prospective employer\nAccepted, and it's the primary (and best) document you have to offer\nNeeded to showcase extensive research or publications\nNecessary to highlight specialized skills or qualifications in a detailed manner\n‍\nWhat is a CV format?\nA CV format refers to the layout and structure of your Curriculum Vitae. The way you organize and present your information can significantly impact how potential employers perceive your qualifications.\nJust like resumes, there are different Curriculum Vitae formats to choose from, each serving a purpose depending on the stage of your career and industry.\n‍\nWhy a CV format is important\nA clear, organized, professional CV template highlights your strengths and makes it easier for hiring managers to assess your fit for the role quickly.\n‍\nGood curriculum vitae formatting is also important because it:\nGrabs attention: By using a clean layout with bold headings, bullet points, and plenty of white space, your CV becomes more visually appealing and easier to read.\nOrganizes career experience: Arrange your sections logically, listing your career experience in reverse chronological order. This allows employers to quickly see your most recent roles and understand your career progression.\nHighlights achievements: Your CV should showcase your key accomplishments with impact. Use bullet points to clearly present your achievements and back them up with measurable details (think data, percentages, or numbers).\nPresents a professional image: Consistent font, alignment, and spacing signal attention to detail, while proofreading ensures you avoid errors that could detract from your credibility.\n‍\nTypes of CV formats\nWhen selecting the right curriculum vitae format for your job search, it’s important to understand the available options. Each format offers unique advantages, and choosing the best one largely depends on your experience and the role you’re targeting.\nWhether you need to emphasize a solid career progression or showcase your skills for a career change, picking the right format can make a big difference.\nBelow are some of the most common CV formats. You’ll learn more specifics about each later in the article.\n‍\nReverse-chronological CV format\nThis is the most traditional CV format. In it, your work experience and education list your most recent accomplishments first. It’s an ideal format for those with a steady, consistent work history.\n‍\nSkills-based CV format\nAlso known as a functional CV, the skills-based format emphasizes your abilities over your job history. It can be ideal if:\nYou’re changing careers\nHave significant employment gaps\nWant to focus on specific strengths\nInstead of organizing your experience by job titles, it’s structured around key competencies. This lets you draw attention to what you bring to the role—even if your path hasn’t been the most traditional.\n‍\nCombination CV format\nA combination CV merges elements of both the chronological and skills-based formats.\nThis format is particularly effective if you have a solid work history but also want to highlight key skills. It allows you to strike a balance between showing career progression and demonstrating the talents you’ve honed over time.\n‍\nBonus: Creative CV format\nUsed primarily in fields like art, design, or media, this format allows for more visual and creative expression. A creative template is not recommended for U.S. roles due to applicant tracking systems (ATS) unless specifically requested.

You'll also find CV examples—including one and two-column options—to help you decide which format fits your career and industry needs.\n‍\nPros and cons of CV formats\nEach curriculum vitae format comes with its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Here’s a quick overview:‍\n1. Reverse-chronological CV\nThe most widely accepted and popular format, this is also called a chronological CV. And it's ideal in most situations.\nThis CV format emphasizes your career progression by listing career experience from newest to oldest, showcasing your most recent positions and accomplishments at the top. The best part? This format is widely accepted across most industries and is best for anyone who wants to highlight a consistent career trajectory.\n‍\nHere are 9 free reverse-chronological templates you can use for free.\n‍\nTeal Note: The standard curriculum vitae format uses two columns, with sections like education and skills typically on the right side. However, depending on the type of CV you choose, you can opt for a more simple, one-column layout.\n‍\nHow to format a chronological CV\nIn a reverse chronological CV, the layout follows a straightforward structure, with your work experience listed from the most recent to the earliest roles. Most CVs in this format use two columns, placing sections like Education and Skills on the right for easy access. However, if you prefer a more streamlined look, a single-column format works just as well.\nRegardless of the layout you choose, the main focus remains on presenting a clear timeline of your career history, making it easy for employers to track your professional growth.\n‍\nA chronological CV typically includes the following sections in this order:\nContact information\nPersonal statement (as long as it adds value)\nCareer experience (in reverse-chronological order)\nEducational background\nSkills\nOptional: Certifications, Awards, and Professional Associations\n‍\nHow a chronological CV format is organized\nA chronological CV is organized by time, with your most recent roles at the top. It’s designed to highlight your professional growth and recent achievements.\nEach role includes your job title, employer, dates of employment, and key accomplishments—ideally quantified to demonstrate impact. Education and skills sections typically support your experience by showcasing relevant qualifications.\n‍\nWhen to use a chronological CV format\nA chronological CV is perfect when you have a steady work history that reflects growth in your career. This format is particularly useful in industries like finance, law, and healthcare, where employers prioritize experience and career progression.\nIt works best if your goal is to emphasize your professional development and showcase how your recent roles have equipped you for the position you’re applying for. By highlighting your career trajectory, you demonstrate a clear path of advancement that aligns with the expectations of these fields.\n‍\n2. Skills-based CV\nA skills-based CV, also known as a functional CV format, emphasizes your abilities and expertise over your work history. This format can be useful for those changing careers, professionals with gaps in employment, or individuals with varied job experience.\nInstead of focusing on your job titles and dates, a skills-based CV highlights the specific skills that make you an ideal candidate for the role.\n‍\nHow to format a functional CV\nIn a skills-based CV, the focus shifts from the timeline of your employment to your key skills and accomplishments. This format allows you to showcase your expertise by organizing your CV into distinct skill categories. Under each category, you’ll provide examples of relevant experiences, projects, or achievements that demonstrate your abilities.\nWhile many skills-based CVs use a two-column layout for efficiency, you can opt for a one-column approach here, too. This layout places sections like Education, Certifications, and Publications directly beneath your Career Experience, offering a streamlined and straightforward presentation.\n‍\nPro Tip: If you're looking for some inspiration, check out these CV examples and use them as a guide to format your own. Or, use one of our functional templates to save yourself time.

Combination CV\nA combination CV merges the best of both the chronological and skills-based CV formats. It allows you to highlight your career progression and the key skills you’ve developed over time.\nThis format is ideal for professionals who want to showcase a strong work history while emphasizing particular skills—preferably tech and tools—aligning with the role they’re applying for. It’s a flexible option that works across many industries and career stages.\n‍\nHow to format a combination CV\nIn a combination CV, your work experience and skills are given equal importance.\nBegin with a Skills section that highlights the abilities most relevant to the job. This is followed by a chronological listing of your work history. While this format can be presented in either one or two columns, a two-column layout often works best, with education and additional sections placed on the right for easy reference. Just be cautious not to overload each page with too much detail.\n‍\nA combination CV includes the following sections in this order:\nContact Information\nPersonal Statement (optional)\nSkills Section (highlighting key abilities)\nCareer Experience (in reverse-chronological order)\nEducation\nOptional: Certifications, Awards, and Professional Associations, etc.\n‍\nHow a combination CV is organized\nA combination CV equally showcases both your skills and work experience. After your contact details and personal statement, it starts with a Skills section, allowing you to highlight your most relevant competencies right away.\nThis is followed by a chronological listing of your career experience, offering context for how your skills have been applied in real-world scenarios.\nThis balanced layout not only highlights your capabilities but also shows how they’ve contributed to your past roles, making it easier for employers to see the full picture of your qualifications.\n‍\nWhen to use a combination CV\nA combination CV is ideal for mid-career professionals who want to highlight a blend of skills and experience. It works well if you have a solid career history but also want to emphasize certain abilities that make you a standout candidate for a specific role. It’s particularly effective in roles that require a mix of hard and soft skills, such as management, marketing, or tech positions.\n‍\nCombination CV format example\n‍\nPro Tip: Still not sure which option is best for you? Take advantage of Teal’s CV Builder and its flexible design to seamlessly switch between different formats.\nWhether you’re using a chronological, skills-based, or combination CV, you can easily rename sections, move them to different positions, and customize your layout—all without the hassle of manual formatting.\n‍\nCurriculum Vitae format best practices\nA well-formatted CV can make a world of difference in how employers perceive you.  Here are some best practices to help you get it right every time you hit apply.\n‍\nKeep it clear\nKeeping your CV easy to read is important. It ensures hiring managers can quickly understand your qualifications. Here's how:\nWrite with a clean and easy-to-read 10- or 12-point font\nKeep the formatting consistent throughout\nBreak up text with white space\nDon't overload one page with too much information\n‍\nUse CV bullet points\nBullet points are a great way to make your CV more readable.\nThey allow the reader to scan your document and recognize key information. Use them to list your:\nSkills\nProfessional accomplishments with impact\nCertifications or degrees\nBe consistent \nConsistency makes it easier for hiring managers or recruiters to read and understand what you bring to the table.\nEnsure consistent formatting for headings, font sizes, and bullet points.\n‍\nTailor your content\nTailoring your CV to the specific job connects the dots between what you've done before and how you can bring that experience to a new position.\nRather than sending out the same generic CV with every application, take the time to customize it to the specific job and company.\n‍\nTo tailor your CV:\nReview the job description\nNote the required skills, qualifications, and experiences.\nCustomize your CV by emphasizing the skills and experiences aligning with the job requirements.\n‍\nUse an ATS-friendly CV format\nEspecially in the U.S., recruiters use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to organize applications during the hiring process.\nTo make sure your CV parses correctly into these organizational systems, make sure to use an ATS-friendly CV template that's widely accepted and easily scanned by any modern ATS.\n‍\nCV formatting mistakes to avoid\nEven a strong CV can be undermined by common errors. To make sure your CV stands out for the right reasons, here are some mistakes you should avoid:\nOvercrowded layout: Don’t try to cram too much information into your CV. Use white space wisely to give the document a clean, organized look.\nInconsistent formatting: A professional CV needs to be consistent. Make sure your font sizes, styles, and spacing are uniform throughout the document.\nNeglecting achievements: Simply listing job responsibilities isn’t enough. Highlight your accomplishments using numbers or measurable results to make your experience more impactful.\nCreative formats for ATS applications: While creative CVs may look visually appealing, they can be a nightmare for ATS systems.\nLeaving out essential details: Skipping basic sections like Contact Information or neglecting to include your academic background can leave gaps in your CV. Always cover the essentials.\nTypos and grammar mistakes: Double-check your CV for errors. A small typo or grammatical mistake can make you appear less detail-oriented.\nIncluding unnecessary personal information: Personal details like your date of birth, marital status, or nationality are not needed on most CVs, especially in the U.S.‍\nHow to format a Curriculum Vitae with Teal\nStep 1.

This makes it crucial to get the structure right from the start to avoid unnecessary formatting headaches later on. Here's a step-by-step guide to help:\n‍\n1. Choose the right CV template\nOpen Word and click \"File\"> \"New.\"\nIn the search bar, type \"CV\" or \"Resume.\"\nBrowse through the templates and select one that aligns with your style and industry.\nIf none of the templates match what you need, you can start with a blank document and format it manually.\n‍\n2. Set up margins and spacing\nEnsuring that your CV has enough white space helps with readability. Set your margins to 1 inch on all sides:\nGo to \"Layout\"> \"Margins\"> \"Normal.\"\nUse line spacing of 1.15 or 1.5 to prevent your text from looking too cramped. To adjust:\nSelect your text, go to \"Home\"> \"Line and Paragraph Spacing,\" and choose your preferred setting.\n‍\n3. Use a professional font\nGo to \"Home\" and select your desired font and size (between 11 and 12 points).\nEnsure headers stand out by using bold or a slightly larger font size. But remember, if you change one header, you have to change them all.\n4. Create section headings\nClearly defined sections make your CV easier to navigate.\nTo create consistent headings, highlight the text, and use the \"Heading 1\" or \"Heading 2\" options in the \"Styles\" section under \"Home.\"\n‍\n5. Align and organize details\nFor job titles and dates, align them consistently using the tab or ruler function to keep them straight across the page.\nTo use the ruler, go to \"View\" and select \"Ruler,\" then drag the tab stop to align your text.\n‍\nChoose the best CV format with Teal\nThe format of your CV matters.

And with the right combination resume templates or examples, you can effectively bridge the gap between your past experiences and future ambitions.\n\nRename and reorder resume sections in seconds using Teal's AI Resume Builder.\n\n‍\n\nWhat is a combination resume?\nA combination resume incorporates elements of both functional resumes and reverse-chronological resumes. It allows you to showcase your relevant skills and your work history in a balanced way. \n\nThis format typically starts with a clear professional summary, then highlights your hard skills, followed by a reverse-chronological listing of your work experience.\n\nCombination resumes are particularly useful if you have diverse skills or varied work experiences and want to showcase these elements effectively. It's ideal for those making a career change, re-entering the workforce, or who have gaps in their employment history. \n\nBy emphasizing your skills upfront, you can draw attention to what you can do rather than when you did it. For job seekers looking to emphasize both their skills and experience, the combination resume template is an excellent choice.\n\n‍\n\nHow does a combination resume compare with other formats?\nWhile the chronological resume focuses primarily on work history and the functional resume emphasizes skills, the combination resume strikes a balance between the two. This resume approach offers the flexibility to highlight the aspects of your professional profile that are most relevant to the job title you're applying for.\n\nThat’s what makes it a strong option compared to other resume formats. \n\nIt's important to remember that a combination resume still maintains a chronological order in its work history section. It's not just about listing skills but also about demonstrating how these skills have been applied throughout your career.\n\nFor recent graduates, this format can highlight educational experiences, while for those pivoting careers, it can focus on relevant projects or volunteer work that aligns with the new role.\n\n‍\n\nHow to format a combination resume\nA combination resume, as its name implies, combines elements of both chronological and functional resumes. This format allows you to highlight your most relevant skills and experiences while providing a clear timeline of your work history.\n\nKey sections of a combination resume\nHeader: This includes your name, contact information, and, optionally, links to your professional online presence (like LinkedIn).\nProfessional Summary: A brief, impactful section encapsulating your career highlights and key skills.\n\"Skills\" section: A list or bullet points showcasing your most relevant skills. Remember, this section should be tailored to the specific job you're applying for.\nProfessional experience: Focus on accomplishments, impact, and how you used your skills for each role rather than just duties. Keep in mind every job should be relevant to the role you're applying for.\nEducation: Your educational background, often listed in reverse chronological order.\nAdditional sections: Depending on your experience, this can include certifications, awards, volunteer work, or personal projects.\nThe beauty of a combination resume lies in its flexibility. \n\nTypically, after the header and professional summary, the skills summary comes next, immediately showcasing your most relevant abilities. The professional experience follows, providing context and proof of your skills. \n\nEducation and additional sections come at the end, supporting the overall narrative of your resume.\n\nThat said, there’s a slight difference in format depending on the context.\n\n‍\n\nCombination resumes for recent graduates\nThe combination resume format particularly benefits recent graduates lacking extensive work experience.\n\nInstead, they can substitute their educational experience, including relevant projects and courses, in a prominent position.\n\nThis approach allows them to highlight their potential and the skills they've acquired through their education, which are relevant to the job they're applying for. The format would still maintain a reverse chronological order, ensuring it is easy to read and professionally structured.\n\nCombination resumes for a career pivot \nFor individuals making a career pivot, the combination resume format provided above allows them to emphasize transferable skills and relevant projects or volunteer work. These elements can replace or complement the traditional work experience section. \n\nThis approach helps in showcasing how their skills and experiences, even from different fields, are applicable to the new role they are targeting. Again, maintaining a chronological format ensures clarity and structure, which is essential for any professional resume.\n\nIn both cases—for recent graduates and career changers—a combination resume serves its purpose well, balancing the skills and experiences relevant to the new role while maintaining a clear, chronological format.\n\n‍\n\nHow to write a combination resume\nHere’s a detailed guide to writing each section of your combination resume.\n\n1. Header\nAs the first impression, your header should clearly display your name, contact information, and any professional links like LinkedIn. \n\nMake sure it’s easily visible at the top of your resume. A professional-looking header sets the tone for the rest of the document.\n\nThe header of a combination resume\nStart your combination resume with a professional header.\n2. Professional summary\nThis is where you craft your elevator pitch. The goal is to summarize your career journey and highlight skills that transfer well to the new role. \n\nMake it engaging, concise, and focused on why you’re a great fit for this career shift.\n\nHere’s an example of a professional summary for Sarah, a junior marketer looking to enter a mid-level role:\n\nDynamic junior marketer with 3+ years of experience specializing in digital campaigns, SEO, and social media strategies. Proven ability to boost web traffic and conversion rates through innovative and data-driven approaches. Seeking to leverage creative problem-solving and market analysis skills in a challenging mid-level marketing role.\n\nPro-tip: Try Teal's Resume Summary Generator to write tailored, position-specific summaries in a matter of seconds.\n\n3. Skills summary\nList hard skills like tools or programs that are directly relevant to your new career.\n\nIn a combination resume, this part immediately showcases your most relevant capabilities and will ideally be a balance of hard and soft skills relevant to the job description. \n\n4. Professional experience\nStart with your most relevant job roles, even if they aren't in the new career field. Focus on achievements and demonstrate how you used transferable skills to have an impact.\n\nIf you’re feeling stuck on how to write your professional experiences, use the Problem-Action-Result (PAR) method to articulate your past contributions.\n\nYou can also rely on Teal’s built-in AI to help you draft your resume’s content: \n\nJust be sure to manually check that the information is accurate when you review your resume. \n\n5. Education\nInclude all relevant degrees, certifications, and coursework. \n\nIf you’re a recent graduate or have less professional experience in the new field, this section would be used in place of “Professional Experience.” It can also be expanded to showcase academic achievements, projects, or relevant courses that align with your new career path.\n\n6. Additional sections\nThis is your space to include anything else that strengthens your application. Consider adding sections for volunteer work, projects, languages, or other certifications. Tailor this part of the resume to showcase experiences and achievements that further demonstrate your suitability for the career change.\n\nRemember, the key to a successful combination resume for a career change lies in how well you customize these sections to showcase your transition into a new career effectively. \n\n‍\n\nWriting a combination resume with Teal\nIf you’re just getting started, crafting the perfect combination resume can feel overwhelming, especially when balancing so many elements of your professional journey. \n\nBut Teal’s Drag-and-Drop Editor transforms this challenge into a seamless and intuitive process.

With the right approach, your resume can capture the essence of your career and present you as an ideal candidate for the job. \n\nHere are some essential tips to help you create content that stands out, aligns with the job requirements, and effectively communicates your value.\n\n1. Start with action verbs: Begin each bullet point in your experience section with dynamic action verbs. \n\nFor instance, instead of saying, \"Responsible for managing a team,\" say, \"Led a team of 10 professionals to surpass quarterly sales targets by 13%.\"\n\n2. Quantify bullet points: Whenever possible, include concrete numbers and metrics to quantify the work you’ve done. \n\nFor example, rather than saying \"Improved sales,\" specify with, \"Increased sales by 25% over six months through strategic marketing campaigns.\"\n\n3. Tailor content to the job: Align your resume's content with the job description by incorporating relevant keywords.\n\n If the job listing emphasizes \"project management\" and \"team leadership,\" ensure these terms are reflected in your resume, like \"Spearheaded a project team to deliver on-time solutions in a fast-paced tech environment.\"\n\n4. Write clearly and concisely: Avoid industry jargon and complex sentences. \n\nFor example, instead of saying, \"Utilized cutting-edge methodologies to engender an increase in consumer engagement,\" you could say, \"Applied innovative strategies to boost customer engagement by 30%.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, the key to an effective combination resume is to present a clear, engaging narrative of your career that aligns with the job you're applying for.\n\n‍\n\nWriting a combination resume for career change\nChanging careers can be challenging. You’ve already climbed the ladder in one field, and now you’re starting all over at the bottom wrung. \n\nPlus, you need to quickly and concisely explain the transition to hiring managers so they don’t assume you’re a flight risk. \n\nHere are a few tips for writing a combination resume specifically for a career change. \n\n1. Highlight transferable skills\nWhen transitioning to a new career field, it's essential to showcase skills from your previous roles that are relevant to your new path. Focus on transferable skills that can be applied in various contexts. \n\nFor instance, if you’re moving from a teaching role to a corporate training position, skills like public speaking, curriculum development, and audience engagement are highly relevant. \n\nList these skills in a dedicated section and use specific examples in your work history to demonstrate how you've applied them effectively. \n\n2. Emphasize relevant experience\nYour past roles may have more in common with your new field than you think. Scrutinize your work history to identify projects, tasks, or responsibilities that have a direct correlation with the role you’re targeting.\n\nFor each job you list, focus on aspects that align with your new career. For example, if you’re moving into project management, highlight your experience coordinating tasks, managing teams, or overseeing project timelines.\n\nEven roles in different industries can provide relevant experience, such as managing a project or leading a team.\n\n3. Use the professional summary wisely\nYour professional summary is the first thing employers will read, so it's your chance to make a strong impression. This is where you can express your career change intention and why you are a suitable candidate. \n\nWrite a compelling summary that combines your passion for the new field with your proven skills. \n\nFor example, “Passionate about transitioning into digital marketing, leveraging extensive experience in content creation and audience engagement gained from a successful journalism career.”\n\n4. Include your education and continued learning efforts\nHighlighting your education and any ongoing learning efforts is crucial, especially if they are relevant to your new career path. This shows employers your commitment to the field. \n\nList any recent courses, workshops, or certifications at the top of your education section. For instance, if you’re moving into IT, including certifications like CompTIA or Cisco CCNA can be highly beneficial.\n\n5. Include projects or volunteer work\nNon-professional experiences can be just as valuable as paid roles, particularly when they're relevant to the field you're entering. \n\nInclude any freelance projects, internships, or volunteer work that’s related to your new career. \n\nFor example, if you’re aiming for a career in graphic design, include freelance design projects or volunteer work where you created promotional materials for events. Detail these experiences just like you would a job, focusing on what you achieved and learned.\n\nUsing Teal’s AI Resume Builder\nTeal’s AI Resume Builder simplifies the process of writing a combination resume.

It’s not.\nThe font you choose for your resume isn’t just a stylistic decision—it can make or break whether the ATS can properly scan your resume and if a hiring manager or recruiter can actually read it.\nBelow, you’ll learn how your resume font impacts readability and professionalism. You’ll also find the best fonts for resume writing in your industry, along with tips and examples for choosing the right font and how to format it to ensure your design choices improve the overall presentation.\n‍\nWant to make a free resume with the best fonts for your industry (and the ATS) without a lot of manual formatting? Try Teal's AI Resume Builder.\n‍\nWhy is resume font important?\nYour resume's font affects how employers perceive you. It impacts readability and professionalism, and it can influence the overall look of your document. Different fonts have different personalities, much like voices in a room. Some are bold, others are clean and modern, while a few appear more traditional.\nFont choice is part of your communication style. It can help show what makes you unique. A good font ensures your qualifications and experience are clearly conveyed to recruiters and hiring managers.\n‍\nWhat font should a resume be?\nLike most resume formatting tips that have an \"it depends\" answer, there's really no single \"best\" font for resume writing. The right choice depends on your industry, the job you want, and your personal style.\nCertain fonts for your resume work well in creative fields, while others suit more traditional industries. Pick a font that's clear, professional, and fits your field. It should make your resume easy to read (sorry, script font) without distracting from your content. The best font improves your message without overshadowing it.\n‍\nThings to consider when choosing a resume font\nWhen selecting a font for your resume, several factors come into play. Your choice can significantly impact how potential employers perceive your application, so it's worth taking the time to make an informed decision.\n‍\nIndustry you're applying to\nDifferent industries have varying expectations for resume presentation.\nCreative fields like marketing or advertising often welcome more visually striking fonts, while traditional sectors like finance, law, or healthcare typically prefer formal, classic options.\n‍\nType of job you're seeking\nYour font choice should reflect both the position you're applying for and the company culture.\nEntry-level roles might suit simple, clean fonts\nSenior positions could call for more sophisticated options\nStartups and tech companies often appreciate a more modern sans-serif look\nConservative companies typically prefer classic, time-tested choices\nRemember to maintain consistency throughout your resume for a cohesive, polished look.\n‍\nPersonal brand\nThe font you choose can also reinforce your unique professional identity. If you're positioning yourself as innovative and creative, consider a modern or slightly unconventional font. For a brand focused on reliability and expertise, a traditional, widely recognized font might be more appropriate.\nWhile your font should align with your personal brand, never sacrifice readability for style. A font that's difficult to read or distracts from your achievements won't serve you well, no matter how stylish it may be.\n‍‍\nHow to choose the best font and size for your resume\nYour resume font should be easy to read and should align with the industry norms. Understanding the differences between types can help you make the best decision for your document.\n‍\nResume font styles\nWhen choosing a font for your resume, it’s important to choose between serif fonts and sans-serif font styles. These types are the most commonly accepted and professional.\n‍\nSerif\nA classic serif font has small lines or strokes attached to the end of a larger stroke in a letter or symbol. These fonts are often viewed as more traditional and formal. They're commonly used in industries like finance, law, and education, where professionalism and reliability are key. Examples of popular serif fonts include Times New Roman, Georgia, and Garamond.\nWhy choose a serif typeface?\nClassic and professional\nEasy to read\n\nSans-serif\nA sans-serif font, as the name implies, lacks the small lines at the ends of letters, giving them a cleaner and more modern look. These fonts are often used in tech, design, and creative industries, where a modern and minimalist aesthetic is appreciated. Examples of popular sans-serif fonts include Arial, Helvetica, and Calibri.\nWhy choose a modern sans-serif typeface?\nModern and clean\nLegible in-screen\nThe best font size for a resume\nChoosing the right font size is just as important as the font itself. The sweet spot? Between 10 and 12 points. This range keeps your resume readable without sacrificing professionalism.\nFor your main text, stick to 10 or 11 points. It ensures your content is clear and easy to follow. Want your headings and name to stand out? Bump those up to 12 points. This subtle difference draws attention without being overpowering.\nAvoid using anything smaller than 10 points. While it might be tempting to fit more information on the page, it can make your resume hard to read, which is the last thing you want.\nRemember: Your resume should be easy on the eyes. Prioritize clarity and readability to make the best impression.\n‍\nThe best resume fonts in 2024\nTimes New Roman\nTimes New Roman is a classic serif often used for resumes because of its traditional and professional look. It's a standard font that's easy to read both on paper and \n‍\nPros: The Times New Roman font is a common font that is easily readable, familiar to many readers, and a relatively compact font. A font like this one allows you to fit more information onto a page without sacrificing readability.\nCons: Because it's a common font, using Times New Roman can make your resume look generic or uninspired.\n‍\nArial\nArial is a sans-serif font that is commonly used for resumes because of its clean and modern appearance. It is a commonly used font that is familiar to many readers, which can make your resume easy to read and accessible to a wide audience.\n\n‍\nPros: Arial is very legible, modern, and professional, which makes it a great choice for resumes. With clean and simple design that's easy on the eyes, it can help recruiters quickly scan your resume to find the information they're looking for.\nCons: While Arial is clean and modern, it doesn't have the unique or distinctive look that some other fonts offer, which may make your resume less visually impressive.\n‍\nCalibri\nCalibri is another sans-serif font commonly used for resumes because of its clean and modern appearance. It's a popular choice  because it has a contemporary look that's appealing.\n‍\nPros: The Calibri font was designed specifically for on-screen reading, which means it's highly legible even at smaller sizes. Calibri is a font that's  included on most modern computers and devices, which means it'll display consistently across different platforms.\nCons: Because Calibri is commonly used, it may not help your resume stand out from other applicants.\n‍‍\nAlternative resume fonts\nWhile the classics like Arial and Times New Roman are solid choices, they’re not your only options. If you’re looking to stand out while still maintaining professionalism, consider exploring some alternative fonts that strike the right balance between modern appeal and readability.\n‍\nProfessional fonts for resume\nProfessional fonts are trusted, time-tested, and convey a strong sense of reliability and competence.\n‍\nTraditional and commonly used resume fonts include: \nTimes New Roman\nArial\nCalibri\nGeorgia\nHelvetica\nGaramond\nVerdana\nCambria\nBook Antiqua\nCentury Gothic\nPalatino Linotype\nTahoma\nFranklin Gothic Medium\nLucida Sans\nTrebuchet MS\nThese fonts are available on Google Docs and included in Microsoft Word, too. It's worth noting there's no definitive list of the most traditional resume fonts, as opinions on what constitutes a \"traditional\" resume font can vary.\n‍\nCreative fonts for resume  \nApplying for a graphic design, marketing, or other creative role? Don't be afraid to get experimental with the fonts on your resume.\n‍\nHere are some of the best nontraditional fonts to try.\nDidot\nLato\nMontserrat\nRaleway\nMuna\nRollo\nRoboto\nPoppins\nProxima Nova\nPlayfair Display\nOpen Sans\nMadley\nSwifted\nMuseo Sans\nBebas Neue\nFutura\nJeko\nAvenir\n‍\nATS-friendly fonts for resume\nWhen tailoring your resume for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), it's crucial to choose fonts that are both professional and scannable.\n‍\nHere are a few to choose from that ensure your resume is both readable by hiring managers and compatible with ATS software\nArial\nCalibri\nTimes New Roman\nGeorgia\nRoboto\nOpen Sans\nPoppins\nTahoma\n‍\nThe worst resume fonts to use\nWhen it comes to resume fonts, some can do more harm than good. It's important to steer clear of certain fonts that can make your resume:\nAppear unprofessional\nDifficult to read\n‍\nComic Sans\nComic Sans has been a huge source of memes over the last few years, and it's not the default font you want to add to your resume to spice things up. It's one of the few fonts that's immediately seen as a joke. So unless you're playing up humor for a very specific role, avoid this one!\n‍\nThick fonts\nUsing overly thick fonts can make your resume look cluttered and hard to read. These fonts can overwhelm the content and make your resume appear less professional.\nImpact\nArial Black\nRockwell Extra Bold\n‍\nThin fonts\nThin fonts might look sleek, but they can be difficult to read, especially in smaller sizes or on screens. These fonts often lack the necessary impact to make your resume stand out clearly.\nHelvetica Light\nArial Narrow\nCentury Gothic Light\n‍\nItalicized or heavily leaning fonts\nFonts that are overly italicized or have a strong slant can reduce legibility and give your resume a less formal appearance. It's best to avoid these to keep your resume looking polished and professional.\nZapf Chancery\nBrush Script\nMonotype Corsiva\n‍\nCursive fonts\nCursive or script fonts, though they might seem elegant, are not ideal for resumes. They can be difficult to read in blocks of text and can come off as too informal for most professional settings.\nBrush Script\nPacifico\nFreestyle Script\n‍\nHandwritten fonts\nHandwritten fonts may seem personal and unique, but they lack the formality needed for a resume. They can appear unprofessional and make your resume harder to read.\nBradley Hand ITC\nCaveat\nLucida Handwriting\n‍\nHow to choose the best resume font and format\nChoosing the right font for your resume is crucial. With many companies relying on applicant tracking systems (ATS) to scan and file resumes, it's essential to select a font that is both ATS-friendly and visually appealing to human recruiters.\n‍\nUse a professional and easy-to-read font\nYour font sets the first impression. Opt for professional, clean fonts that are easy to read. Fonts like Roboto, Times New Roman, Poppins, and Helvetica are excellent choices. They ensure your resume is clear and accessible on any device, making them ideal for both ATS and recruiters.\n‍\nUse the correct font size\nFont size plays a significant role in readability. Stick to a size between 10 and 12 points for the main text, ensuring your content is easy to digest. For your name or resume section headings, consider using 12-14 points. This subtle hierarchy makes your resume look organized without being overwhelming.\n‍\nStart creating your resume from a template\nUsing a template ensures font consistency across your resume. Teal's Resume Builder allows you to choose from professional fonts like Times New Roman, Roboto, Poppins, and Helvetica, ensuring your resume is formatted correctly and optimized for ATS scanning.\n‍\nBenefits of Using a Template:\nTemplates maintain uniformity in font size and style.\nPre-set fonts in the template save time, letting you focus on content.\nA template limits time-consuming manual formatting.\n‍\nSpacing in fonts\nProper font spacing enhances readability. Ensure there's enough space between letters, lines, and paragraphs to make your resume easy to read. Overly tight spacing can make your resume look cluttered, while too much spacing might make it seem sparse.\nLetter spacing: Slightly increase resume spacing for better readability.\nLine spacing: Use 1.15 to 1.5 spacing for a clean, readable format.\n‍\nBold and italicize fonts appropriately\nUse bold and italic fonts sparingly to highlight key information. Bold your name and resume section headings to draw attention. Avoid overusing any italics features to maintain a clean, professional resume that's also easy to read.\n‍\nFont-friendly margins\nMargins affect how your fonts are perceived. Proper margins prevent text from feeling cramped and help maintain a balanced layout. A one-inch margin on all sides is typically recommended, giving your fonts enough space to breathe and keeping your resume organized.\n‍\nColors in fonts\nWhile your resume should remain professional, a touch of color can make certain elements stand out. Stick to neutral or dark tones for the main text. If you use color on your resume, limit it to your name or section headings, and ensure it doesn’t distract from the content.\n‍\nCreate a well-formatted resume fast\nThe font on your resume can make or break the readability.

Including some impressive achievements and accomplishments that demonstrate your skills and value can make all the difference.\nBut with so many candidates vying for the same job, how do you make your accomplishments stand out? Well, by highlighting your most impactful achievements to make a lasting impression on potential employers.\nBelow, you'll discover what resume accomplishments are and why they're important for showcasing your skills and value. You'll also learn the difference between resume accomplishments and job duties, best practices for writing unique resume accomplishments, and, see examples of resume accomplishments across jobs, experience levels, and industries.\nStruggling to land interviews with your resume accomplishments? Sign up for Teal today!\n‍\nWhat are resume accomplishments?\nResume accomplishments are specific achievement examples in your past work experience, education, or other relevant areas that demonstrate your resume skills, abilities, and value as a candidate.\nAccomplishments can include any notable contributions or achievements you've made in your previous roles, listing accomplishments such as saving the company money, increasing sales, reducing costs, implementing new systems, earning awards or recognition, completing a project ahead of schedule, or exceeding performance metrics.\nAccomplishments are typically presented in a bullet-point format on a resume and should be quantifiable and measurable wherever possible to provide concrete evidence of your abilities and impact.\n‍\nThe difference between resume accomplishments and job duties\nWhile job duties describe the responsibilities you were assigned, accomplishments highlight the impact and results of your work. Here’s how to differentiate between the two:\n‍\nJob Duties: These are the tasks and responsibilities you were expected to perform as part of your job. They outline what you did on a daily basis.\nFor example:\nManaged a team of sales associates\nConducted market research\nDeveloped marketing strategies\n‍\nResume Accomplishments: Accomplishments, on the other hand, showcase your contributions and the results of your efforts. They demonstrate how well you performed your job duties and the value you brought to your role.\nFor example:\nIncreased team sales by 20% through effective leadership and strategic planning\nIdentified new market opportunities that led to a 15% increase in revenue\nLaunched a marketing campaign that resulted in a 25% boost in customer engagement\n‍\nWhy do you need accomplishments on your resume?\nResume accomplishments define your capabilities and achievements in tangible terms, underlining your value as a candidate for potential employers. Highlighting them on your resume is essential because it demonstrates how you get results and create value in your roles. This approach not only makes your resume more compelling but also sets you apart from other candidates.\nYou need resume accomplishments to:\n‍\nShowcase abilities and strengths\nIncluding accomplishments on your resume is a way to demonstrate your abilities and strengths to potential employers. \nBy highlighting your accomplishments, you provide concrete evidence of your past achievements, which can help convince employers that you have the necessary skills to succeed.\n‍\nDemonstrate value\nListing job duties gives a prospective employer a glimpse into your past roles, but resume accomplishments demonstrate your value. \nThey give potential employers tangible proof of how you've contributed to your previous companies. \nWhether it's surpassing a sales target, implementing a new system to improve productivity, or leading a team project to success, your accomplishments showcase the value you can bring to their company.\n‍\nHighlight impact\nHiring managers look for action verbs tied to achievements. Action verbs highlight momentum and demonstrate proactive engagement.\nWords like \"developed,\" \"led,\" \"improved,\" \"increased,\" and \"managed\" are some of the most common. \nQuantifying your resume with numbers, metrics, and data alongside action verbs backs up an accomplishment statement by demonstrating your level of impact.\n‍\nIncrease hiring opportunities\nWith hundreds of resumes to sift through, hiring managers are looking for candidates who have skills and experience aligning with the position they need to fill. \nBy highlighting your accomplishments, you're providing evidence of your skills and indicating your potential value to the company. This boosts your chances of landing an interview and, ultimately, getting hired.\n‍\nStand out in the candidate pool\nWith so many candidates vying for the same roles, standing out is critical. \nResume accomplishments help differentiate you from other candidates. They act as your unique selling points, demonstrating why you're the best candidate for the job. \nYour resume is also more memorable than those listing duties and job responsibilities.\n‍\nBuild confidence\nThis confidence can be helpful during job interviews because you'll be more able to succinctly showcase your qualifications and respond articulately to questions—leaving a strong and lasting impression on the interviewers.\n‍\nHow many resume accomplishments do you need?\nIdeally, between three and five relevant accomplishments for every position is the overall guideline for the number of accomplishments in your work experience. In your professional summary, include two to three of your most notable achievements. These numbers strikes a balance between showcasing your achievements and keeping your resume concise and readable.\nBy focusing on your most impactful accomplishments, you can demonstrate your value to potential employers without overwhelming them with information.\n‍\nWhere should achievements go on a resume?\nProfessional summary\nOne or two of your top achievements (that align with the role you're applying for) can (and should!) be part of your professional resume summary. Your professional summary is a chance to talk about your career in aggregate and highlight particularly notable results that are directly related to the jobs you're applying for.\n‍\nPro tip: Use the AI technology integrated within the Resume Builder to generate professional summaries that highlight key achievements, work accomplishments, and past successes directly within the Teal platform.\n‍\nWork experience\nFor an experienced professional, achievements should be integrated into your Work Experience section as bullet points under each of your previous roles.\nThese accomplishment statements offer more context for the hiring manager by showing them how your skills and outcomes were relevant to your work. (Any academic achievements should be noted under your Education section.)\nShowcase your achievements in the Work Experience section like this:\n\nHow to write resume accomplishments\nWriting good resume accomplishments can be straightforward if you follow the CAR method: Challenge, Action, Result.\nThis method helps you clearly articulate the impact you've made in your previous roles. By breaking down your achievements into these three components, you can create more compelling statements that highlight your ability to drive results.\n‍\nChallenge\nStart by identifying the challenge or context in which you worked. This sets the stage for your accomplishment and provides necessary background information. It answers the questions: What was the situation? What problem needed solving?\n‍\nAction\nNext, describe the specific action you took to address the challenge. Be clear and concise, highlighting your direct contributions. This section should focus on what you did, how you did it, and any strategies or tools you used.\n‍\nResult\nFinally, detail the result or outcome of your actions. Quantify your achievements whenever possible to give potential employers a clear picture of your impact. This answers the question: What was the result of your action?\n‍\n‍\nWriting compelling resume achievements isn't always straightforward. But with the right approach, you can create an impactful narrative that impresses potential employers. \nWrite Compelling Resume Achievements With AI\n‍\nBest practices for writing resume accomplishments\nBe specific and quantify\nDetails matter, and numbers don't lie. Quantifying your achievements can lend credibility and substance to your resume. \nThink about notable outcomes with a number attached e.g. increasing revenue by a certain dollar amount or percentage, improving project turnaround times from one time frame to another, or academic achievements like a GPA or test score.\nThen, to be specific, instead of saying \"improved sales,\" you could write \"increased sales by 25% in Q1 2023.\" This gives recruiters and prospective employers a clear picture of the scale of your achievements, making your accomplishments more impressive and believable.\n‍\nUse action verbs\nStarting your accomplishments with action verbs can add a punch to your statements. Instead of writing \"was responsible for project management,\" try \"spearheaded a team to complete a project.\" Action verbs give your resume a dynamic and proactive feel, helping to create a powerful image in the minds of potential employers.\n‍\nEmphasize impact\nYour potential employer wants to know the difference you can make. So, when listing your achievements, highlight the impact of your work.\nDid you bring in a major client? Streamline or quicken a process? Reduce company costs? Emphasizing the effects and outcomes of your actions can help prospective employers understand your value. It's also crucial to pair your achievements with the right words.\nAs you analyze your achievements, evaluate your wording and consider alternative resume synonyms to maximize impact.\n‍\nTailor the accomplishments to the job description\nEach job has unique requirements, and tailoring your resume to match these can significantly boost your chances of getting noticed. Here’s how to ensure your accomplishments are aligned with the job you're applying for:\n‍\n1. Leverage the JD\nStart by closely examining the job description for the position you’re targeting. What stands out? What terms or phrases are repeated most?\n2. Incorporate relevant keywords\nAdd the skills and terms you identified in the job description into your accomplishments.\n3. Highlight relevant experience\nFocus on the most relevant achievements that directly relate to the job requirements.\n4. Quantify your achievements\nUse metrics to provide concrete evidence of your impact. Quantifying your results (e.g., \"increased sales by 20%\") makes your accomplishments more compelling and relevant.\n‍\nPro Tip: Want to see how your current resume stacks up to the specific job?

Work accomplishment examples could be:\nIncreased online leads 278% via these social media accounts and marketing channels and improved customer engagement rates 67% over a 12-month period\nImproved cost-per-click of digital ads, resulting in annual marketing savings of over $50,000\nMore accomplishment examples for experienced professionals:\nDeveloped and implemented a new sales strategy that increased revenue by 25% in the first year\nImproved client retention rate by 15% by implementing a new customer service program and training staff to provide exceptional customer service\n \nAccomplishments examples - leadership\nA good leader has the ability to inspire, motivate, and guide their team towards achieving common goals.

Make a resume with Teal's customizable ATS-friendly templates so it can be found by recruiters easily.\n‍\nWhat is an ATS?\nAn ATS, or Applicant Tracking System, is a software application used by recruiters and employers to collect, sort, scan, and prioritize job applicants' resumes. It serves as a centralized database for managing the recruiting process, from posting job ads to screening candidates.\nATS is widely adopted by companies of all sizes, from small businesses to large enterprises across various industries. Recruiters, HR professionals, talent acquisition specialists, and hiring managers are the primary users of this technology.\nApplicant Tracking Systems are most often used early in the recruitment process when job postings attract a high volume of applicants. The software moves the initial screening along more quickly by automatically parsing resumes and ranking candidates based on their qualifications, skills, experience, and other job-relevant criteria specified by the employer.\nBefore learning how to write an ATS-friendly resume, it's important to understand how this technology has advanced over the years.\nThat way, you can write your resume with the most modern best practices in mind.\n‍\nThe evolution of Applicant Tracking Software\n1990s: Emergence of the ATS\nThe arrival of digital job boards like Monster.com resulted in an overwhelming increase in applications.\nEarly ATS systems were developed to lighten the burden on recruiters, focusing on basic functionalities such as keyword scanning, job posting automation, and tracking applicants through the hiring process.\n‍\n2000s: Web-based systems and enhanced features\nThe introduction of web-based platforms marked a shift, making ATS more accessible and integrated.\nThis era brought sophisticated data management, compliance features for new regulations like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the initial steps toward integrating ATS with other HR solutions.\n‍\n2010s: Integration and improved candidate experience\nIntegration with HR systems became deeper and many platforms embraced mobile, reflecting the changing way candidates applied for jobs. ATS providers also began to focus on the candidate experience, making the application process simpler and more intuitive.\n‍\n2020s: AI, analytics, and the drive for diversity\nToday's ATS systems leverage AI and advanced analytics for better candidate matching and insightful reporting.\nThere's a strong focus on reducing unconscious biases and promoting diversity in recruitment processes. Plus, with the importance of data privacy, ATS systems are evolving to align with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.\nWith continuous advancements in technology, ATS is set to further transform the entire recruitment process, making it more efficient, equitable, and candidate-friendly.\n‍\nThe benefits of using an Applicant Tracking System\nApplicant tracking systems offer many advantages to employers. Understanding how they work—and how employers use them—can also give job seekers an edge in the hiring process.\nATS technology allows recruiters and hiring managers to work more efficiently by automating many manual tasks involved in reviewing applications, such as screening resumes and identifying qualified candidates.\nAn ATS can also enhance the job seeker experience.  It’s what allows candidates to submit their materials through an online portal and receive confirmation that their application has been received. Many ATS platforms also allow candidates to check the status of their application and receive updates throughout the hiring process.\nThis level of transparency creates a positive impression of the employer brand.\nMost importantly, applicant tracking systems improve the quality of hiring decisions by supplying a smarter way to evaluate candidates. Recruiters can search for specific skills, qualifications, and experience across thousands of resumes simultaneously.\nThe most qualified applicants rise to the top of the rankings based on relevance to the job requirements.\nWith an ATS, companies avoid overlooking qualified candidates whose resumes may have slipped through the cracks using traditional manual review methods.\n‍\nHow ATS technology works\nApplicant Tracking Systems are a way to manage, scan, filter, and rank candidates by their resumes. Employers use ATS to more efficiently manage the recruitment process. They automatically process resumes and cover letters to extract relevant information like skills, experience, education, and other qualifications.\nA helpful analogy to understand ATS is to think of it as an email spam filter. In the same way spam filters analyze incoming emails to identify and separate junk mail from important messages, ATS software scans resumes to identify qualified candidates whose qualifications best match the job requirements.\nIt's important to understand that ATS is designed to surface and prioritize the most qualified applicants, not arbitrarily eliminate candidates. The system ranks resumes based on how well the content aligns with the job description and requirements specified by the employer or recruiter.\nResumes with higher rankings are moved to the next stage of review, while those with lower rankings may be deprioritized.\nThe ATS is not anti-candidate. It’s not a bot. A human always determines the required keywords and sets the sorting parameters, so a human is always in the loop when ATS candidates are removed from the process.\n‍\nHow hiring managers and recruiters use ATS\nWhen a job posting receives hundreds or thousands of applications, ATS technology becomes an invaluable tool for quickly identifying the most qualified candidates.’\n‍\nStep 1: Set the criteria\nIdentify role requirements: The process starts with recruiters defining the job's specific needs. This could include particular skills, required years of experience, necessary education levels, and relevant certifications.\nInput keywords into the ATS: These job requirements are then translated into keywords and criteria, which are inputted into the ATS software to help filter applications.\n‍\nStep 2: Scan and rank resumes\nATS scan submissions: Once the criteria are set, the ATS begins scanning all submitted resumes. ATS serves as a resume checker by scanning the resume for keywords that match the predetermined criteria.\nRank based on relevance: The software evaluates how well a resume aligns with the job requirements. It considers the presence and frequency of specific keywords throughout a resume, including their professional summary, work history, and skills section.\nPrioritize top candidates: Resumes that demonstrate greater relevance through keyword matching are then ranked higher in the applicant pool for easier identification by recruiters.\n‍\nStep 3: Review and shortlist\nQuick access to top applicants: With the heavy lifting done by the ATS, recruiters can quickly review resumes that have been prioritized by the system.\nShortlist for further evaluation: The most promising candidates, now highlighted at the top of the list, are selected for further evaluation, which could involve interviews and additional assessments.\nHere's what an ATS search looks like from the recruiter's perspective: \n‍\n‍\nAs you can see, the ATS allows recruiters to filter through candidates quickly and efficiently based on role criteria. This initial vetting is a crucial first step in recruiting processes.\n‍\nMisconceptions around ATS technology\nThere are a few common misconceptions about \"beating\" the ATS that should be addressed.\n‍\nMisconception 1: ATS software eliminates applicants\nMany believe that Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) automatically eliminate candidates who don't meet certain criteria.\nHowever, the purpose of ATS software is to help recruiters manage and prioritize applications more efficiently.\nInstead of discarding candidates, these systems sort and rank resumes based on how well they match the job description and key qualifications. The goal is to surface the best-suited candidates before scheduling interviews.\nTherefore, the focus should be on tailoring your resume to closely match the job requirements, which will enhance your chances of getting prioritized by the ATS.\n‍\nMisconception 2: Using white text or hiding keywords\nSome advise using white text or hiding keywords in an attempt to \"stuff\" resumes with relevant terms.\nThat said, most modern ATS can detect this tactic, and it may even get your application rejected for trying to \"game\" the system unethically.\n\"Black hat\" resume tactics like this won't cut it in 2024.\n‍\nMisconception 3: Submitting resumes in PDF format\nAll modern ATS systems can read PDF. PDFs that include several images are the exception. Images can be difficult for ATS software to scan effectively. The ATS may struggle to correctly extract text and interpret the document's structure, such as headings, bullet points, and sections.\nPlain text (.txt) or Microsoft Word (.docx) formats are generally more ATS-friendly. They allow the software to easily recognize and categorize information based on common textual cues and hierarchy, such as headings for experience, education, and skills.\nHowever, PDF resumes are also ATS-friendly.\nIf you’re debating between which format to use, check out this guide on PDF or Word doc resumes. \n‍\nHow to \"beat\" Applicant Tracking Systems\nInstead of trying to \"beat\" the ATS technology, it's better to think about how to best play by the rules. For that, consider the following ATS best practices.\n‍\n1. Use ATS-friendly formatting\nStick to clean and simple formatting when preparing your resume to ensure it is ATS-friendly.\nAvoid using tables, columns, headers, and footers, as these elements can often confuse ATS parsing algorithms. Choose clear section headings and a linear format to facilitate easy reading and interpretation by the software.\n‍\n2. Incorporate relevant keywords\nTo make your resume more effective, carefully analyze the job descriptions and include keywords and skills that match the position's requirements.\n‍\n‍\nIt's important to integrate these keywords naturally within the context of your bullet points and qualifications rather than simply listing or stuffing them, which can appear forced and may be flagged by the ATS.\n‍\n3. Quantify bullet points\nATS systems often favor resumes that quantify your resume. Specify achievements with numbers, percentages, or specific milestones, as these provide concrete evidence of your capabilities.\nInstead of vague adjectives like \"successful\" or \"experienced,\" use precise data points to describe your accomplishments.\n‍\n4. Customize for each role\nTailoring your resume for each job application is crucial. Adjust the skills and experience sections to align closely with the role.\nThis customization helps highlight your suitability for the role and can increase your resume's visibility in the ATS.\n‍\n5.

Plus, informal language might not be effectively parsed or valued by an ATS, which typically scans for more formal, keyword-focused content.\nConsistent professional language: Descriptions like \"I work with awesome clients\" or \"tedious tasks to a robot\" should be revised to a more formal tone and structured to highlight specific skills or bullet points in a way that aligns with common industry keywords.\nContact information: While the basic contact information is present, it could be formatted more conventionally. For example, including a professional email address would enhance the professionalism and ATS friendliness of the resume.\nDate and job title formatting: The resume should maintain a consistent format for dates and job titles. For instance, including the exact start and end month/year for all roles and clearly differentiating job titles from the company and location information can enhance ATS parsing accuracy.\n‍\nAdditional recommendations\nQuantifiable bullet points: Instead of broad statements, including specific, quantifiable bullets is beneficial. For example, \"increased leads by X%\" or \"improved content engagement by Y%\" can provide clear metrics for ATS systems and hiring managers.\nSkill section: Adding a dedicated skills section with specific technical and soft skills relevant to content marketing could improve ATS matching. This section should include industry-relevant skills like \"SEO,\" \"content automation,\" and \"digital marketing.\"\nTo enhance ATS compatibility, you should always use a more formal tone, ensure consistent formatting, and tailor the resume with keywords from the job descriptions to which you are applying.\nThis will help with ATS systems and ensure the resume appeals to human reviewers in higher-level positions.\n‍\n3. ATS-friendly resume template #1 - The best example\n‍\nWhat works\nClear format: The resume uses a simple, straightforward layout, which is good for ATS scanning. There are clear headings and sections (Work Experience, Education, Certifications, Skills), which help an ATS parse the information correctly.\nRelevant keywords: The resume includes industry-relevant keywords such as \"technical support,\" \"system administration,\" \"network security,\" and certifications like \"Microsoft Certified\" and \"Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA).\" These will likely match the job descriptions, enhancing the resume's visibility in applicant tracking systems.\nStandard contact information: Including basic contact information at the top (name, address, phone, email, LinkedIn) is standard practice and ATS-friendly. This ensures easy extraction of contact details by an ATS.\nJob titles and dates: The work experience section lists job titles, company names, locations, and dates of employment. This structured approach helps ATS recognize the progression and duration of employment.\nOverall, this is a strong resume with an ATS-friendly template and professional language used throughout.\n‍\nNOTE: The example above was created in seconds with Teal's AI-Resume Builder.

Increased integration with AI and machine learning\nATS technology is poised to become increasingly sophisticated by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. These technologies will enhance ATS's capabilities in accurately parsing resumes, matching skills, and ranking candidates.\nBeyond sorting applications, AI will also play a crucial role in the screening process through mechanisms like video interviews, which can analyze factors like tone of voice and body language.\nThis trend suggests a move towards more dynamic and intelligent systems that can adapt to the nuances of candidate profiles and job requirements more effectively.\n‍\n2. Emphasis on soft skills assessment\nWhile traditional ATS systems have heavily focused on hard skills and keyword matching, the future will likely see a significant shift toward evaluating soft skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence.\nFuture ATS may require candidates to complete specific assessments or provide detailed examples demonstrating these crucial competencies.\nThis evolution reflects a broader recognition of the importance of soft skills in the workplace and the need for tools that can effectively assess these less tangible qualities.\n‍\n3. Seamless candidate experience\nThe next generation of ATS will prioritize enhancing the candidate experience to make it as smooth and user-friendly as possible.\nExpect to see features like:\nMobile-optimized application processes\nChatbots to instantly answer applicant queries\nIntegrated video interviews\nThese improvements would reduce friction for applicants, thereby attracting a broader pool of potential candidates, and improving the perception of the employer's brand and culture.\n‍\n4. Enhanced data privacy and security measures\nAs applicant tracking systems collect and process increasingly sensitive personal data, there will be a heightened focus on ensuring data privacy and security.\nFuture ATS will likely incorporate advanced security protocols and compliance measures to protect candidate information. This could involve more robust encryption methods, secure data storage solutions, and regular audits to comply with international data protection regulations.\nEnhancing trust and safety will be crucial as the use of ATS expands and as more data is handled digitally.\n‍\nWrite custom ATS-friendly resumes with Teal\nNavigating the job market can be intimidating, especially when faced with the challenge of making your resume stand out in a sea of candidates.

They focus on how you get (or got) results. They also give your resume a feeling of progress while highlighting your ability to handle responsibilities using your skills and expertise.\n\nBelow is a list of power verbs for your resume. You'll also learn more about why they're so important and how to add them to your experience the right way.\n\n‍Want to align the language on your resume with any position? Sign up for Teal for free and try the Job Description Keywords Finder. \n\n‍\n\nWhat are action verbs?\nAn action verb describes a physical or mental action.\n\nUnlike a linking verb that connects a subject to additional information, an action verb indicates what the subject (in the case of your resume, you) of a sentence is doing or did.\n\nResume action verbs can be strong and direct like \"spearheaded.\" They can also be more generic and weak, like \"helped.\"   \n\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nHow to use action verbs in your resume\nYou can use strong action words in your resume to describe what you did in previous roles, clarify past accomplishments and achievements, and highlight skills and abilities.\n\nSo, how do you actually incorporate them the right way?\n\n‍\n\n1. Choose the strongest verb\n‍Start each resume bullet point or sentence with a clear action verb that accurately describes your direct role.\n\nFor example, use \"Managed\" instead of \"Was responsible for managing.\"\n\n‍\n\n2. Pick a verb tense\n‍The exact choice of verb tense in your resume sentences isn't critically important for recruiters. The priority is clear communication.\n\nSome guidelines might suggest strict rules about tense, but focus on what best conveys your experience. And be sure to keep the same verb tense for each unique position.\n\n‍\n\nHere are some tense suggestions:\n\nCurrent position: Use the present tense for ongoing responsibilities in your current role, showing active engagement.\n\nFor example: \"Manage a team of 10, optimizing marketing efforts to increase campaign conversion rates by 30% over six months.\"\n\nPast Positions: Use the past tense for roles or projects you've completed, highlighting your achievements.\n\nFor example, \"Led a marketing campaign, increasing company revenue by 20% over three months through strategic digital advertising, resulting in significant market share growth.\"\n\n‍\n\n3. Highlight results and impact\n‍The #1 resume mistake is listing responsibilities or duties without results. As often as possible, link your action verb to a measurable outcome or significant impact. This approach emphasizes the effectiveness and impact of your work.\n\nFor example: \"Developed a new inventory system that reduced supply costs MoM by 15%.\"\n\n‍\n\nPro Tip: Making improvements to your resume can come down to word selection and language. Need some guidance on when, where, or how to use certain resume phrases? Check out this resume synonym library for specific guidance on finding the best word choice.\n\nGet Started with Teal Today\n‍\n\nWhy is it important to use action verbs in your resume?\nUsing action verbs in your resume is important for several reasons:\n\n‍\n\nMakes a more dynamic and engaging resume\nAction verbs create a sense of motion and activity in your resume, making it more vibrant and interesting.\n\nMeaning that instead of using passive phrases like \"was responsible for\" or \"assisted with,\" strong action verbs convey a sense of action and accomplishment.\n\nFor example, instead of writing \"Worked on user interface updates,\" you could write: \"Developed a new user interface for the main customer dashboard, improving user interaction metrics by 40% over four months, resulting in a 25% increase in customer satisfaction scores.\"\n‍\n\nDemonstrates skills and accomplishments\nAction verbs allow you to move beyond listing tasks to describing how your actions have positively impacted your previous positions.\n\nThey also emphasize the specific steps you took and the measurable outcomes that followed, providing a straightforward view of your contributions.\n\nFor example, instead of saying, \"Responsible for scheduling meetings,\" try something like, \"Organize weekly team meetings for a 12-person department, streamlining communication and improving meeting efficiency by 30% over the past six months.\"\n‍\n\nDifferentiates you from other candidates\nUsing action verbs in your resume helps differentiate you from other candidates by clearly showing the direct impact of your work.\n\nThese verbs show your specific contributions and successes (so how you've managed tasks and solved problems) in ways that are both quantifiable and unique from other candidates.\n\n‍\n\nShows you're results-oriented\nAction verbs in your resume highlight your ability to execute specific outcomes. By emphasizing results through your actions, you demonstrate a focus on achieving goals and improving processes.\n\nVerbs like \"resolved,\" \"solved,\" \"organized,\" \"trained,\" or \"optimized\" can show how you identified or addressed tasks to achieve goals.\n\n‍\n\nWhere to include action verbs in your resume\nIncorporating action verbs throughout your resume does two things. \n\n1. Clarifies your roles and contributions\n\n2. Emphasizes the impact of your actions\n\nHere are some examples of areas where using action verbs can strengthen your resume.\n\n‍\n\nProfessional Summary section\nIn this section of your resume, use action verbs to talk about the most impressive things you've done (relevant to the job you're applying for) alongside the tangible results of those things—similar to a highlight reel.\n\nFor example, \"Growth Marketing Director with 7+ years of experience leading growth initiatives across digital platforms. I've developed and executed strategies that resulted in a 35% increase in customer acquisition. My efforts in optimizing digital advertising campaigns have increased conversion rates by 25% while reducing costs by 20%. Additionally, I've collaborated with product development teams to successfully launch new product lines, achieving a 40% increase in sales.\n‍\n\nUsing Teal's AI feature to create your professional summary\nStruggling with what to say? Use the AI in Teal's Resume Builder to create unique professional summaries directly on the Teal platform.\n‍\n\nWork Experience section\nStart each resume bullet point with a strong action verb that describes your role in specific achievements and impact.\n\nAs often as possible, emphasize the results with specific metrics to underline the significance of your contributions.\n\nFor example, \"Oversaw a team of 10, increasing sales by 20% over the fiscal year with stronger team collaboration and strategic planning, resulting in considerable market share growth.\"\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nProjects section\nWhen talking about relevant projects, use action verbs to underscore your direct involvement and the skills you used. Include specific outcomes to connect the relevance and impact of your work.\n\nFor instance, \"Researched user behavior trends, identifying key patterns that led to the development of a new user engagement strategy. This strategy resulted in a 40% increase in user activity, significantly improving the platform's overall performance.\"\n‍\n\nusing action verbs in your resume projects section\nEducation section\nIf you're a recent grad or haven't had much professional experience, you can use action verbs to describe your coursework. This can showcase the skills you've sharpened in school that are also transferable to the workplace.\n\nFor example, \"Conducted a comprehensive analysis of teaching methods and identified 50+ effective strategies for improving student engagement. The insights from this study were implemented in a classroom pilot program, resulting in a 40% increase in student participation and earning a 97% grade for the project.\"\n‍\n\nusing action verbs in your education project section\n‍\n\nWhat are strong action verbs for multiple types of roles?\nSome action words are more versatile than others. And they can be used across jobs and industries.\n\nThese words describe abilities such as leadership, innovation, and analytical thinking, which are highly valued by employers across different fields.\n\nHere are some action verb examples to use in your resume for multiple types of roles:\n\nAdvised\nAnalyzed\nCommunicated\nConducted\nCoordinated\nCreated\nDesigned\nDeveloped\nEvaluated\nFacilitated\nImplemented\nImproved\nLed\nManaged\nNegotiated\nOrganized\nResolved\nStrategized\nSupervised\nTrained\n‍\n\nResume action verbs for different types of experience\nAny resume can benefit from the strategic use of action verbs, no matter what kind of work you do.\n\nWhether you're a product manager, software engineer, marketing manager, teacher, painter, dog walker, or CEO, your resume is more likely to resonate with a prospective employer if you take the time to use the right adjectives, linking verbs, action verbs and other types of language.\n\nSelecting the perfect action verbs for your resume, where every word counts, might require some effort.

Here’s how to make the most of them in your resume.\n‍\nTailor power words to job descriptions\nTo maximize your chances of getting noticed, align power words closely with the specific job description:\n1. Analyze the job posting: Identify key skills, qualifications, and responsibilities emphasized in the listing.\n2. Highlight relevant keywords: Note industry-specific terms and power verbs used in the description. Tip: Teal's Matching Mode does this for you.\n.\n3. Match your experiences: Select power words that accurately describe your achievements and align with the job requirements.\n4. Incorporate naturally: Weave these words into your resume, ensuring they fit contextually and don't appear forced.\n5. Prioritize placement: Use the most impactful power words in prominent sections like your professional summary and recent job descriptions. If you're writing a cover letter, sprinkle power words throughout but don't stuff them in any one section.\n‍\nBalance action words with concrete examples\nWhile power words add impact, they must be supported by specific, quantifiable achievements:\nStart with a power word: Begin each bullet point with a strong action verb.\nFollow with a specific accomplishment: Provide context and details about what you achieved.\nQuantify results: Include numbers, percentages, or other measurable outcomes whenever possible.\nShow impact: Explain how your actions benefited the company or contributed to larger goals.\n‍\nPower word example in a sentence\nWeak: Responsible for sales increase.\nStrong: Spearheaded sales initiative that boosted revenue by 35% in Q3, outperforming targets by 20%.\n‍\nAvoid overuse and maintain authenticity\nWhile power words are effective, overuse can diminish their impact and make your resume seem insincere:\nUse variety: Avoid repeating the same power words throughout your resume.\nBe truthful: Only use words that accurately reflect your experiences and abilities.\nBalance with simpler language: Mix power words with more straightforward language to maintain readability.\nConsider context: Ensure the power words you choose are appropriate for your industry and career level.\nRead aloud: Review your resume by reading it out loud to catch any awkward phrasing or overuse of power words.\n‍\nReplacing weak words with power words\nNot all words are created equal when it comes to your resume.

They're also objective; you either have a specific skill or you don't (and unlike soft skills, your level of expertise can be measured).\nBut understanding hard skills goes beyond recognizing them.\nHard skills are continuously evolving, with new ones emerging in response to technological advancements (hello, AI!) and changing industry demands. Most industries are adopting new technologies, methodologies, and tools. And because of this, continuous learning and \"upskilling\" to acquire and update hard skills is now an important part of professional growth.\n‍\nHow do hard skills differ from soft skills?\nTraditionally, skills are categorized into two types: hard and soft skills. Resume soft skills highlight more abstract or interpersonal skills—like how well you work with others, while hard skills are more tangible, quantifiable, and directly related to job functions or tasks.\nSoft skills often include abilities like:\nCommunication skills\nLeadership\nEmotional intelligence (EQ)\nProblem-solving skills\nAdaptability\nAs companies (especially across industries like tech, industrial, and engineering) rely more and more on automation and technology, the importance of more human-centered soft skills is often emphasized similarly to hard skills. \nHowever different they may be, these two types of skills are not mutually exclusive. Instead, they're complementary. Most roles or positions require a blend of soft and hard skills for employees to succeed. \nFor example, data analysis requires not only statistical knowledge but also critical thinking and storytelling to transform raw data into actionable insights. Similarly, the rise of remote work emphasizes the need for self-management and effective online communication (think platforms like Zoom and Slack), illustrating the codependence of technical hard skills and soft skills.\n‍\nWhat are technical skills?\nTechnical skills are hard skills. They are abilities learned through training or education that apply to specific work, particularly in fields like IT, engineering, or science. These skills often require the use of complex tools and technologies\nList of technical skills\nAdobe Creative Suite\nApplication Development\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nAutoCAD\nBig Data Management\nBlockchain\nC++\nCAD Software\nCoding\nComputational Design\nComputer Programming\nCSS\nCybersecurity Analysis\nDatabase Management\nDevOps\nHTML\nInformation Security\nIoT (Internet of Things)\nJava\nMATLAB\nNetwork Structure & Design\nPython\nR Programming\nRuby on Rails\nSAS\nStatistical Analysis System (SAS)\nUX Design\nWeb Design\nWeb Development\nXML\n‍\nAre technical skills also hard skills?\nTechnical skills fall under the category of hard skills. These are specific abilities acquired through education or training (like coding, data analysis, and using specialized software). Emphasizing these skills on your resume can highlight your technical expertise, demonstrating your capability to handle job-specific tasks and making you a more attractive candidate to potential employers.\n‍\nHow to learn hard skills\nLearning hard skills is a strategic investment in your career.\nThese skills can be acquired through various means, but the key is to find the learning method that best fits your career goals and current circumstances.\n‍\nOn-the-job training\nOne of the most effective ways to learn hard skills is through on-the-job training. Gaining hands-on experience allows you to apply what you learn in real-world scenarios—deepening your understanding and proficiency.\nMany employers offer training programs or mentorship opportunities to help you develop these skills. Whether it's tackling new software or learning advanced technical procedures, the experience you gain on the job is a great way to learn hard skills.\n‍\nCertifications for hard skills\nCertifications strengthen your career. They're a tangible testament to your skillset, expertise, and dedication to continuous learning.\nDifferent industries value various certifications that highlight diverse hard skills, boosting your credibility and opening up new career opportunities. Consider pursuing certifications in areas relevant to your field, such as project management, IT, or specialized software, to enhance your skill set and marketability.\n‍\nBest hard skills to put on a resume\nShowcasing the right hard skills on your resume can make a significant difference in catching the eye of potential employers.\nThese skills highlight your technical abilities and demonstrate your capability to perform specific job functions. Here are some of the best hard skills to consider adding to your resume.\n‍\nResume hard skills\nIf you're worried you don’t have very specific technical skills that measure up to a particular role, don't get discouraged just yet. There are some general hard skills for your resume that still pack a punch.  \n‍\nProject Management Skills: These skills are about overseeing projects to ensure they're completed on time and within budget. Proficiency in project management software like MS Project, JIRA, or Asana can be a definite plus.\nForeign Language Proficiency: In an increasingly globalized (and remote!) world, being multilingual can be a significant advantage, opening up opportunities in international business and communication.\nDigital Marketing: This encompasses SEO, content marketing, social media marketing, and PPC advertising. A deep understanding of tools like Google Analytics, Facebook Ads Manager, or SEMrush is also a great companion to this skill.\nSalesforce Proficiency: Salesforce is a leading customer relationship management (CRM) tool. Expertise in this platform can be a significant advantage, particularly in sales and marketing roles. (Other CRM platforms include Hubspot, Zendesk, ClickUp, and Active Campaign). \nData Analysis: In today's era of big data, the ability to interpret and use information to make informed business decisions is invaluable. Including any knowledge of data analytics tools such as SQL, Python, and Tableau is also beneficial. \n‍\nResume technical skills \nSoftware Development: This hard skill involves designing, implementing, and testing software (and indicates strong computer skills). Knowledge of languages like Java, Python, or C++ and an understanding of software development methodologies can make you a valuable asset across various industries.\nMachine Learning/AI: With businesses increasingly leveraging AI and ML for decision-making and operations, having this skill can place you on a short list of candidates with hard skills in tech innovation.\nTechnical Writing: The ability to communicate complex information in an easy-to-understand way is critical in many fields. Proficiency in tools like Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, and MadCap Flare could increase your appeal to recruiters and hiring managers.\nCloud Computing: As more businesses move to the cloud, knowledge of cloud service platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud can help boost your prospects.\nCybersecurity: With cyber threats on the rise, knowing how to protect and recover systems, networks, and data from cyber-attacks is crucial. Command of tools like Nessus, Wireshark, or Metasploit can strengthen your credentials.\n‍\nJob-specific hard skills\nJob-specific hard skills are the specialized abilities and knowledge needed to perform particular tasks in a specific job.\nFor example, software engineers may need proficiency in Python or Java, while marketing managers might need different, specific marketing skills like SEO or Google Analytics.\nThe TLDR? Job-specific skills are important because they connect your past experiences directly to the job you're applying for, showing hiring managers that you have what they're looking for.\n‍\nExamples of technical skills\nTechnical skills examples - software engineer\nWhen it comes to software engineering, having the right technical skills is crucial.

It's about strategically adding hard skills throughout your resume to amplify your potential to leave a lasting impression on prospective employers.\n‍\nChoosing the right hard skills \nListing the right hard skills on a resume comes down to understanding what a hiring manager or recruiter is looking for and presenting your relevant hard skills to match these needs. \nSo, how do you choose the best hard skills for your resume?  \n‍\nCreate a hard skills list\nBrainstorm all of your technical abilities, certifications, and education. What industry-specific knowledge and expertise do you have? What project management, analytical, or leadership methodologies and frameworks have you worked with? What software or tools are you proficient in within your field? Once you have your list, store it in one central location for easy access when it comes time to fill out an application. \n‍\nPro Tip: The Teal AI Resume Builder Skills Manager is a great place to do this.\nStore all of your skills in one central location.

Look for words or phrases that indicate tools and technical competencies like \"Google Analytics,\" \"process improvement,\" \"project management,\" \"Python,\" \"content strategy,\" etc.\nThe Teal AI Resume Builder and Job Application Tracker highlight the most important hard skills from any job description so job seekers like you can easily list them on your resume.\n‍\n‍\nMatch your hard skills to the role\nOnce you've identified the key skills required, you should match these with your own. Between hard skills, soft skills, and other requirements, you want to have at least 70% of the qualifications a company is looking for. (But remember, honesty is critical, so only incorporate your actual skills.)\nWhere to include hard skills on a resume \nDemonstrating hard skills on a resume in various sections offers a high-level view of your technical abilities. Dispersing them adds depth and showcases your well-rounded skillset. \nSo, what sections should have examples of your hard skills? \n‍\nProfessional Summary\nIncorporate hard skills in your professional summary or short professional bio to complement your soft skills and most notable accomplishments. \nFor example, if you're a software engineer, one sentence of your professional summary could look like this: \"As a highly skilled software engineer with 10+ years of experience, I have expertise in Python development, database management, and a strong problem-solving mindset.\"\n‍\nWork Experience\nInclude hard skills in your work experience achievements to complement your soft skills and illustrate how you effectively made an impact. \nSo, let's say you increased conversions by 3x through A/B testing and data analysis of landing page copy as an achievement; that would look like this: \n\"Achieved a 3x increase in conversions through A/B testing, effectively utilizing data analysis to identify and implement data-driven solutions that optimized website performance and user experience.\"\n‍\nHard skills section\nCreate a dedicated resume \"Skills\" section to highlight hard skills related to those in the job description.\nA list draws attention to your diverse range of abilities and highlights the unique qualities you bring to the table as a professional. And using a dedicated section prominently showcases your technical expertise and interpersonal skills.\n‍\nHow to tailor hard skills to fit job descriptions\nBy tailoring your resume to every role you apply for, you demonstrate how your skills align with the position's requirements. And this helps hiring managers evaluate how qualified you are.\nThink of your hard skills as ingredients for a recipe and the job description as your cookbook. Creating a dish with delicious flavor requires specific ingredients, and so does the right candidate for a job.\nTo tailor your resume to a role, start by carefully reading the job description—this is your recipe. Pay attention to the skills the employer is looking for (these are the 'key ingredients'). Are they looking for proficiency in a particular language or expertise in a software tool?\nNext, look at your own set of hard skills. (Think of this as your 'kitchen pantry.') Choose those skills that match the ones listed in the job description. And just like the perfect ingredients make a dish flourish, choosing the right hard skills makes you the ideal candidate for the role.\n‍\n\n‍\nHard skills: What to expect in the future job market\nThe future of hard skills is being rapidly shaped by the increase in cutting-edge technology development (particularly AI, machine learning, and data science). \nAs tech progresses, traditional hard skills may need to be supplemented with expertise in newer technology. And the result could be a significant increase in opportunities for those with skill proficiency in these areas.\nAs hard skills become more intertwined with technological innovation, so does the importance of lifelong learning. Investing in education, training, and development will be key for job security, more opportunities, and a competitive edge.\n‍\nUse hard skills to stand out\nUnderstanding and effectively leveraging your hard skills is crucial to standing out in today's job market. And it isn't just about providing a list of your skills; it's about offering a holistic view of your professional journey, demonstrating how those hard skills, with complementary soft skills, have amplified your impact. \nThe Teal AI Resume Builder can help you present those skills with clarity and precision throughout different sections of your resume—highlighting them in a way that resonates with prospective employers.\n‍\nCompare your hard skills with Teal\nWant to make sure you've got the best ingredients for every application during your job search?

During a career change\nIf you're transitioning to a new field or industry, a resume objective can effectively communicate your transferable skills and highlight your motivation for making a career change.\n\n2. For entry-level applications\n If you have limited professional experience, a resume objective can showcase your enthusiasm, motivation, and relevant skills—demonstrating your potential to succeed.\n\n3. As a student or recent graduate\nA resume objective statement helps highlight your educational achievements, internships, or extracurricular activities, while also expressing your career aspirations and goals when you're just starting out.\n\n4. For intra-industry transitions\nSuppose you want to shift your career focus or explore new opportunities within your current industry. In that case, a resume objective can help you communicate your desire to leverage your existing skills and experiences in a new capacity.\n\n5. When returning to work\n For job seekers who have taken a break from their careers, whether for personal reasons or to pursue further education, a resume objective can signal your readiness and commitment to re-enter the workforce.\n\n6. In a non-traditional career path\nIf you have a unique career trajectory or more diverse experiences that aren't immediately apparent from your work history and achievements, a resume objective can help you convey your story and showcase the value you bring to potential employers.\n\n‍\n4 tips for writing a resume objective statement\nTip #1: Understand context\nOnly use a resume objective statement in specific application situations such as:\n\nFor entry-level applications\nAs a student or recent graduate\nFor intra-industry transitions\nWhen returning to work\nIn a non-traditional career path\nTip #2: Quantify your success\nYour resume objective should include relevant numbers, metrics, and data when possible.\n\nTip #3: Keep it simple\nBrevity is key. Your career objective statement should only be 2-3 sentences.\n\nTip #4: Understand the role\nRead the job description thoroughly to make sure you understand the job objective, important skills, and key details. (Use a tool like the Teal Job Application Tracker to pull all of this information for you—in just seconds.)\n\nTeal's Job Application Tracker details\nUse Teal's Job Application Tracker to understand every unique role.\nWhat makes a good resume objective\nA good resume objective goes beyond being clear and concise. Think of it as a high-level overview, used in place of an \"About Me\" section on a resume.\n\nSo what additional points should you consider when crafting yours?\n\nYour resume objective should:\n\nBe tailored to the specific job you're applying for by aligning with the requirements and responsibilities of the position.\nUse impactful and engaging language to grab a prospective employer's attention and leave a memorable impression\nInclude resume action verbs to convey a sense of movement and impact\nShowcase your enthusiasm and passion for the role and company to solidify your genuine interest and commitment to the role\nMistakes to avoid when writing resume objectives\nA good resume objective statement includes specific elements. There are also some common oversights to watch out for:\n\nAvoid using clichés or generic statements that don't show your unique skills\nDon't be vague or ambiguous; be specific about your qualifications and value\nMake sure to clearly articulate your career intentions and the value you offer to employers\n‍\n\nPros and cons of resume objectives\nIf you find yourself wondering, \"Do I need a career objective statement?\" or \"Are resume objectives necessary?\" understanding the pros and cons can help guide you as you decide whether or not a resume objective is right for you.\n\nPros of a resume objective\nCommunicate clear focus: A resume objective provides a concise statement that clearly communicates your career goals.\nFacilitate career transitions: For job seekers changing careers or industries, a resume objective can help bridge the gap between your previous experience and your desired role.\nGuide entry-level job seekers: A resume objective can significantly benefit job seekers with limited professional experience by showcasing enthusiasm, motivation, and any relevant skills.\nEmphasize personal branding: A well-crafted resume objective statement can serve as a branding statement—highlighting your unique strengths, core values, and career aspirations.\nCons of a resume objective\nLack of relevance: In some cases, resume objectives may not provide substantial value if they don't align closely with the specific job requirements set forth by the hiring manager.\nSound generic: A resume objective risks sounding generic or clichéd if it's not tailored and lacks specificity.\nDon't align with shifting hiring practices: In today's market, resume objectives trend towards more concise and targeted professional summaries as a quick overview of your qualifications and achievements rather than a traditional career objective statement.\nExhibit redundancy: In most cases, the position you're applying for is already evident from the job title or objective of the job application itself.\nUltimately, whether or not you need a resume objective statement strongly depends on factors like your career stage and the specific job application. In any case, it's always important to assess the relevance of each of your resume sections and consider whether they add value to your overall application.\n\n‍\n\nWhy is a resume objective important?\nResume objectives are important because they allow job seekers like you to quickly communicate your intentions and highlight how your qualifications align with a prospective employer's needs. And they do this in a way that grabs attention.\n\nResume objectives are most applicable while you're still in school, very early in your career, or if you're changing careers. Think of them as a resume mission statement.\n\nA traditional resume objective focuses on the type of role you're applying for.\nA targeted resume objective is tailored to a specific job or industry.\nA future-oriented resume objective emphasizes your aspirations and goals for career growth.\n‍\n\nAlternatives to resume objectives\nThere's been a shift away from traditional resume objectives influenced by the changing dynamics of the job market. Today employers increasingly prioritize specific skills, experiences, and achievements over career goals and generalized qualifications.\n\nAs a result, modern resumes should focus more on providing a more engaging resume introduction as a professional summary of qualifications and accomplishments directly relevant to the desired position.\n\nInstead of focusing on your career goals, a professional summary provides a snapshot of your relevant skills, experiences, and accomplishments as they align with the job description of the role you're applying for.\n\n‍\n\nAn example of a professional summary\nAn example of a professional summary.\nResume objective vs. professional summary\nA professional summary and resume objective statement might seem very similar, and while they do have some elements in common, there are also a few notable differences.\n\nA professional summary is more of a career statement or overview.\n\nProfessional summaries:\n\nAre concise and targeted\nShowcase your unique value prop in a way that's tailored to the role you're applying for\nDon't include any unnecessary details\nDiffer from a resume objective by leaving out career goals, intentions, and a company's goals\n‍\n\nWriting a professional summary\nIf a professional summary sounds like a better option than a resume objective statement, use Teal's resume maker to create a tailored professional summary with the click of a button.\n\nTeal's generative AI pulls keywords (like technical skills and soft skills) from the job description as well as details from your work experience to create an effective, tailored, resume summary statement.\n\nWrite Your Summary With AI\n‍\n\n‍\n\nWriting a resume objective statement\nWhile a professional summary is often the better option for a resume introduction, you can still use Teal's resume creator to write your resume objective statement.\n\nAll you need to do is log in to your account, navigate to the resume builder, click on the resume you wish to use, then scroll to \"Professional Summaries.\" Here, you can create, save, and choose from as many resume objectives as you need.

Omitting your name or contact details\nInstead of your first name, you can use a pseudonym like your middle name or a generic title like \"Experienced Marketing Professional\" at the top of your resume. And while not recommended for any reason but to protect personal safety, if you opt not to use your name, you should briefly explain why.\nWhen removing contact details, provide a non-work, generic email address, and a Google Voice number. Remember, hiring managers have to be able to contact you for an interview.\n‍\n2. Generalizing your current employer\nIf you're job searching in secret, rather than naming your current company, describe it in general terms.\nFor example, \"Large tech company in Silicon Valley\" or \"Fortune 500 financial services firm.\"\n‍\nBut if you opt to leave off the company's name, you need to describe what they do and who they cater to.\n‍\nPro Tip: The Work Experience section of Teal's AI Resume Builder offers a space below each company for you to include a brief description.\n‍\n3. Focusing on achievements, not titles\nInstead of listing job titles that might be easily traceable to a specific company, you can opt to focus on resume accomplishments and impact. But, you also need to describe your position in detail below the job title or in your professional summary.\nFor example, \"Senior leadership role - marketing department\" rather than \"Director of Brand of Marketing at XYZ Corp.\" Then, write a brief sentence about the position describing what it is.\n‍\nHere's how omitting a title could look:\nSenior leadership role - marketing department\nOversaw the development and execution of comprehensive brand marketing strategies to drive revenue growth and brand awareness.\nIncreased solution awareness by 30% through targeted social media and email marketing campaigns\nLed a team of 15 marketing professionals, improving productivity by 20% through implementation of new project management tools\nBoosted customer engagement by 25% by launching content marketing initiatives and personalized communication strategies based on canceled subscriber behavior\n‍\nAlign your resume with Teal\nRegardless of what details you're omitting and why, your resume always needs to align with the job description of the role you're applying for. You still need relevant skills and experiences to be considered.\nWith Teal's Match Score, you can see how your resume compares to any job description at a glance. You also get suggestions for what details and language you need more of to better align with that unique job.\nMatch Your Resume to a Job\n‍\n‍\n4. Excluding confidential project details\nProjects on a resume can help you showcase your work. You can exclude specific project details and confidential client information while still highlighting your achievements and skills.\n‍\n‍\nInstead of naming specific projects or clients, use more general terms and focus on the outcomes and impact of your work.\nThis approach ensures your resume remains impactful and relevant to the roles you're applying for, even when dealing with projects under NDAs or specific clearance levels, like in the examples below.\n‍\nConfidential Software Development Project\nLed a team to develop a highly secure software solution that increased operational efficiency by 30%.\nManaged the project lifecycle from concept to deployment, ensuring 100% compliance with strict security protocols.\nClassified Financial Reporting Optimization\nDirected a top-secret initiative to streamline financial reporting processes, reducing reporting time by 40%.\nCoordinated with 4 departments to integrate a secure reporting system, improving accuracy and efficiency to 99% while maintaining confidentiality.\n‍\nBy using more general descriptions and project titles, you can protect sensitive information while still showcasing your achievements and the value you bring to a prospective employer.\n‍\nWrite a confidential resume with Teal\nWhile a confidential resume can be a useful tool in certain situations, it's important to consider the pros and cons carefully.\nOn one hand, it allows you to explore new opportunities discreetly and protect sensitive information. On the other, it may make your application less compelling and could raise questions about your transparency.\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you need to create a confidential resume, Teal's AI Resume Builder can help you align your content with each unique application while keeping certain details under wraps.\n‍\nWith Teal, you can:\nInclude general descriptions giving a sense of a company's size and industry without revealing its identity\nAnalyze job descriptions and identify the most important skills to highlight (even when you can't include specific project titles or company names)\nEnsure your resume includes relevant keywords for your industry and the specific job you're applying for\nMake a confidential resume look professional and consistent, even with omitted information\nSign Up For Teal Today\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIs my resume confidential?\nIs it OK to put confidential on your resume?\nHow do you put confidential projects on a resume?\nShould my resume be private?\nHow do I create an anonymous resume?","URL Slug":"write-confidential-resume","Meta Description":"Learn how to write a confidential resume and understand the potential risks involved to protect your job search effectively."}}]}

You can have a strong work history, relevant responsibilities, impressive accomplishments, and undeniable expertise under your belt. But none of those matter if you can’t summarize them in a way that captures the attention of potential employers.\nThat’s why it’s helpful to familiarize yourself with some of the best resume phrases and action words. While your resume content will be as unique as you are, these reliable phrases can give you some new ideas, help you write about your qualifications and abilities, and impress recruiters.\nReady to beat the blank page and put some sentences down on paper? This detailed guide (and long list of resume power phrases) will get you started.\nWant to make a free resume with the best phrases that grab attention? Use Teal's free AI Resume Builder to write action-oriented statements showcasing your achievements and aligning with job descriptions.\n‍\nUnderstanding resume writing phrases: What they are and why they matter\nResume phrases are specific words or combinations of words used to highlight your skills, abilities, knowledge, and achievements on your resume.\nUnderstanding the job market can help you choose the right phrases that align with industry expectations and employer needs.\nIt’s tempting to think the language you use on your resume doesn’t carry much weight, but choosing the right phrases and verbs can make or break your resume in the eyes of a potential employer. For example, take a look at this comparison:\nHandled customer questions and complaints\nResolved customer inquiries and complaints with a 95% satisfaction rate, resulting in a 20% increase in customer retention\nIt’s not hard to see that the second option is far more impressive. And though there are other creative strategies and resume best practices at play in that example (such as quantifying accomplishments), the resume writing itself also makes a world of difference. The second bullet includes several powerful phrases and action words:\nResolved\nResulting in an increase\nSatisfaction rate\n‍\nWhat are the different types of resume phrases?\nThere’s no shortage of ways you can categorize these phrases, but this guide covers three common types of resume phrases:\nAction phrases: Describe specific actions you took\n“Implemented a new inventory system…”\nPower phrases: Describe results you achieved or an impact you made\n“Reduced costs by…”\nDescriptive phrases: Describe your role and responsibilities\n“Managed a team of 10 customer service representatives”\nThere’s a lot of overlap between those categories—especially between action phrases and descriptive phrases. The main difference is that action phrases highlight what you actually did while descriptive phrases focus on your responsibilities.\nEspecially if you opt for using the STAR method on your resume, many of your bullet points will incorporate all three types of phrases at once.\n‍\nGood resume phrase example\n“Led a cross-functional team of 10 to develop and launch a new customer relationship management (CRM) system, resulting in a 30% increase in customer satisfaction and a 20% boost in sales within six months.”\nAction words or phrases: Led, develop, launch\nPower phrase: Resulting in a 30% increase in customer satisfaction and a 20% boost in sales\nDescriptive phrases: Cross-functional team of 10, new customer relationship management (CRM) system, within six months\nThat example illustrates the importance of the right phrases for your resume, but choosing them involves more than opening up a thesaurus while you’re writing. The best resume phrases are:\nConcise: Your document shouldn’t be stuffed with resume buzzwords and cliches. Get to the point and cut out fluff or unnecessary words.\nSpecific: It’s tempting to over exaggerate your responsibilities, but big words aren’t always better. Phrases should clearly describe your role and achievements and increase understanding.\nAction-oriented: Particularly in your work experience section, each of your bullet points should start with a strong resume action verb to demonstrate how you achieved results.\nRelevant: Your resume isn’t intended to be a rundown of all of your tasks and positions throughout your career stages. Relevance is key. The job description will provide helpful clues and valuable insights to guide your resume writing.\nQuantified: Resume phrases are intended to kick start your writing process and not be copied and pasted exactly as they are. Customize them to your experience and supplement them with metrics and real-world examples to add extra impact. \nImprove Your Resume Today\n‍\nWhere should you use resume phrases?\nWondering where to use these short snippets on your document? Most resume phrases are incorporated in two different sections of your resume:\nYour resume summary (sometimes called your resume personal statement)\nYour work experience section\nThese phrases can also be effectively used in your LinkedIn profile.\nIn your summary, these phrases can call attention to your overall career highlights, relevant skills, and the success you’ve achieved. In your job history bullet points, they’ll better describe your contributions and achievements in previous roles.\n‍\n46 resume phrases you need to know\nNow that you have the lay of the land, it’s time to look at some resume power words and phrases you can lean on during your resume writing process to effectively convey the skills, value, and solutions you can bring to a job. \nThe best resume phrases start with action verbs—words that describe an action while emphasizing your contributions and achievements. Need help coming up with some? Check out this comprehensive guide to resume action verbs before you get started.\n‍\nAction phrases for resumes\nUse resume action verbs and phrases to describe the specific actions you took and contributions you made in a previous position.\nAssisted clients\nCreated reports\nDesigned and executed\nDeveloped a process\nDeveloped content\nDrafted documents\nFacilitated meetings\nGenerated ideas\nIdentified opportunities\nImplemented a new system\nMonitored progress\nOrganized events\nPrepared resources\nResolved issues\nSpearheaded an initiative\nStreamlined operations\nTrained staff\n‍\nPower phrases for resumes\nUse strong power words and phrases in your resume to describe the impact you made and the results you achieved (including specific metrics).\nAchieved top performance\nBoosted customer satisfaction\nDrove significant growth\nElevated team performance\nEnhanced product quality\nExceeded targets\nExpanded service offerings\nImproved accuracy\nImproved efficiency\nImproved retention rates\nIncreased market share\nIncreased revenue\nMaximized resources\nMinimized downtime\nOptimized processes\nReduced costs\nReduced turnaround time\nStrengthened client relationships\n‍\nDescriptive phrases for resumes\nUse these to describe what you were responsible for in a previous position.\nCollaborated cross-functionally\nConducted research\nCoordinated efforts\nCoordinated team activities\nEnsured compliance\nHandled customer inquiries\nLed a team\nMaintained relationships\nManaged projects\nOversaw operations\nProvided support\n‍\nResume phrase examples by job\nThe phrases above are flexible enough to be used in a variety of career paths. But it’s helpful to get a little more specific and look at phrases that apply to a certain job. Here are five different types of roles and examples of key phrases to use for each. \n‍\n1. Project manager resume phrases\nAchieved organizational goals\nDetermined cost-saving initiatives\nDeveloped project plans\nEnsured smooth project execution\nIdentified and mitigated project risks\nImplemented streamlined processes\nLed cross-functional teams\nMonitored project budget and timeline\nReduced project costs\nSuccessfully managed multiple projects\n‍\n2.

Check out this guide to resume bullet points to make your snippets short and strong.\n‍\n5 Essential tips for crafting effective resume phrases\nThe above phrases will get your creative juices flowing as you start writing your resume. But as you continue getting your skills and accomplishments down on paper, here are a few best practices to keep in mind when using common phrases.\n‍\n1. Refer to the job description\nThink your next best step is to pick out a few of the above phrases that sound the best to you? Not quite. Your goal is to use phrases that are the most relevant to the role you’re applying for to demonstrate how your qualifications and expertise match the position’s requirements. Understanding the job market can help you select the most relevant phrases.\nReturn to the job description and stay focused on finding key skills and words. Then, select words and phrases that are the best fit. For example, if the job posting mentions leadership several times, then you’ll choose phrases that use words like “led,” “managed,” “supervised,” “owned,” and “spearheaded.”\nStruggling to figure out which words get a lot of importance in the job posting? Attach a job description in Teal’s AI Resume Builder to see your match score and determine how well your resume aligns with the language and skills from the job description.\n‍\nTeal’s Matching Mode shows you how your resume compares to the job description and provides targeted recommendations for how you can improve.\n‍\n2. Quantify your achievements\nIf you only rely on common phrases, your resume likely won’t stand out from the crowd—after all, everybody will describe themselves as a “go getter” or a “team player” on paper.\nEmployers want to see proof not only of the work you’ve done, but why it mattered. Adding metrics to your accomplishments and bullet points shows recruiters the results you’ve achieved in your past jobs.\nThis is another area where Teal can help with its resume bullet point generator. In your resume, click “add an achievement” and then the “write with AI” button. Teal will automatically come up with three options for metric-driven bullet points you can customize and use on your resume.\n‍\nTeal’s AI Achievement feature generates three suggested achievements you can customize and use on your document.\n‍\n3. Use time-based statements\nReducing costs? That’s impressive. But reducing costs in only three months? That’s sure to get a hiring manager’s attention.\nThat’s why it’s helpful to use time-based statements that describe a certain period of time (for example, “in five weeks or within six months”). These also count as descriptive phrases on your resume.\nIn Teal’s AI Resume Builder, use the Analysis Score to see a detailed breakdown of issues on your resume—including where you’re missing time-based statements.\n‍\n‍\n4. Check your verb tense\nMost of the best phrases start with strong verbs, but don’t get so caught up in the language that you forget about using the right verb tense. On your resume, use:\nPresent verb tense (e.g. “manage”) for jobs you currently work\nPast verb tense (e.g. “managed”) for jobs you worked previously\nIt’s a small change that can make your resume clearer and more polished.\n‍\n5. Rely on tools to help you\nEven with the best phrases to guide you, developing your resume can still feel daunting. Fortunately, you don’t have to start from scratch.\nUse Teal’s AI Resume Builder to get over your fear of a blank page and create your strongest resume yet. It can help you:\nAutomatically generate metric-rich achievements and contributions\nCompare your resume to the job description and identify keywords\nProvide suggestions to make strategic improvements to your content‍\n‍\nAdditionally, these tools can also help improve your LinkedIn profile, which complements your resume.\nSomething as simple as a prompt or an example bullet point can spark your creativity and ease the burden of writing your own resume. With Teal in your corner, you’ll feel more confident throughout the writing process so you can craft a resume that does your experience justice and makes a positive impression on an employer.\nReady to put these phrases and best practices to work on your own resume?

Build a free resume with Teal that aligns with the most important ones for every job.\n‍\nWhat are personal skills?\nPersonal skills, also known as soft skills, are transferable abilities that show how you interact with colleagues and contribute to a positive work environment. Imagine a team brainstorming session—your communication skills help you exchange ideas, while teamwork lets you build on each other's contributions. Both competencies rely on personal skills.\nPersonal skills are used in everyday situations at work, from managing projects to effectively resolving conflicts with teammates or clients.\nIn one survey by Business Name Generator, 84 percent of employees and managers thought soft skills were important for new hires. By highlighting strong personal skills on your resume, you show employers you're a well-rounded professional who can integrate into their team.\n‍\nPersonal skills vs professional skills\nProfessional skills, also known as hard skills, are the technical abilities specific to your job or industry. Think coding languages for a programmer, design software for a graphic designer, or financial knowledge for an accountant. If you’re applying for an open role, these skills demonstrate your proficiency in tasks directly related to the position.\n‍\n‍\nThe main difference between personal and professional skills lies in their focus. Personal skills highlight how you work with others and navigate challenges as well as your own innate qualities. Professional skills, on the other hand, demonstrate your technical expertise specific to the job or industry, like knowledge of a particular software program or financial analysis.\nHere are a few different personal and professional skill examples:\n‍\nPersonal skills examples for resume\nLeadership\nCommunication\nTeamwork\nProblem-solving\nTime management\n‍\nProfessional skills examples for resume\nProgramming languages\nGraphic design\nCybersecurity\nData analysis\nWriting skills\nAccounting\n‍\nSome skills are both personal and professional, for example:\nCritical thinking bridges the gap between analyzing a problem (personal) and building a solution (professional). \nDecision-making has aspects of choosing a deadline for a project (personal) or deciding what software to use (professional).\nProblem-solving requires both the ability to come up with creative solutions (personal) and have technical or professional expertise (professional).\nA well-crafted resume balances both soft and hard skills, proving you're a well-rounded professional with the technical chops and collaborative spirit to excel.\n‍\n\n‍\nImagine two equally qualified candidates on paper. Both have the technical skills and experience listed in the job description. But one candidate stands out. Their resume highlights strong personal skills throughout the bullet points, showing off their ability to collaborate effectively, communicate clearly, and adapt to new challenges. This gives the hiring manager confidence the candidate will fit long-term. This is the importance of personal skills in a resume.\nFrom communication and teamwork to problem-solving and adaptability, highlighting strong personal skills creates a more compelling resume, so you stand out as a job seeker.\n‍\nTop list of personal skills for a resume\nOf course, you should only include personal skills you really possess on your resume. At the same time, a resume is your sales pitch. Demonstrate your strongest personal skills rather than listing every single trait.\nHere is a comprehensive list of in-demand skills to consider when writing your resume.\n‍\n1. Communication\nCommunication skills refer to the ability to express ideas clearly and concisely, both verbally and in writing. This allows everyone involved in a project to understand the situation, ask insightful questions, and contribute their expertise.\n‍\n2.

Analyze it to identify key personal skills and qualities that the employer is looking for.\nLook for opportunities to showcase the skills the company values most in your resume skills section. You can do this faster with Teal’s Matching mode!\nWithin Matching Mode in the Resume Builder, you can select a job from your job tracker to match against your resume. You’ll automatically get a list of highly relevant keyword recommendations that you can add to your resume.\n‍\nStep 2: Choose powerful verbs\nReplace bland words like \"skilled\" or \"helped\" with action verbs that showcase initiative and achievement, such as \"spearheaded,\" \"implemented,\" or \"directed.\"\nExample:\n“Orchestrated the adoption of a new payroll software company-wide, leading to a 40% time savings.”\nPro Tip: Use Teal's AI Bullet feature to write impressive resume bullet points in seconds.\nWrite Resume Achievements with AI\n‍\n‍\nStep 3: Quantify your impact\nQuantify your resume by adding results. Did your communication skills lead to a 20% increase in project efficiency? Highlight measurable achievements in your bullet points to strengthen your claims.\nExample:\n“Increased website conversion rate by 12% through A/B testing and website optimization strategies.”\n‍\nStep 4: Tailor to the job\nDon't overwhelm your resume by randomly stuffing words into your experience section. Aim to highlight the top skills that best represent your strengths and align with the job requirements.\nAccording to Teal’s Director of Talent Mike Peditto, “While there isn't a magic number of skills, a long list can become overwhelming and take focus away from the top skills needed for a job. Focus on the skills that appear early and often throughout the job description. Here, you'll likely find the top five to eight skills the job is asking for, above all else.”\n‍\n‍\nTry to personalize your skills section for each job application, emphasizing the skills most relevant to the specific role.\n‍\nStep 5: Craft compelling descriptions\nStructure your skill descriptions using action verbs followed by a specific example of how you used that skill to achieve a positive outcome. Don't just list responsibilities—show what you accomplished or what results you achieved.\nExample:\n\"Built rapport with a diverse clientele, resulting in a 15% increase in client retention rate.”\n‍\nTips for using personal skills on your resume to attract recruiters\nFollow these tips to use your personal skills to stand out to recruiters and hiring managers:\nInclude relevant personal skills from the job description throughout your resume, but avoid keyword stuffing.\nIdentify existing personal skills that overlap with the job description so you can demonstrate a strong fit for the role. You can use Teal’s Matching Mode in the Resume Builder to choose a job and automatically analyze the job description to find the skills the company values the most.\nProvide specific examples from your work experience. Instead of listing \"problem-solving skills,\" describe a challenge you tackled successfully and its impact on the business.\nHighlight skills consistently throughout the application process, from your resume, cover letter, and interviews. Your resume is only one part of the job search process.\nTeal's Matching Mode feature makes it easy to surface relevant hard and soft skills within a job description to add to your resume. It will also help you identify where the overlap lies, so you can quickly add the ones you really possess.\n‍\nThe best way to add personal skills to your resume\nUsing an AI Resume Builder like Teal can speed up the process of adding the right personal skills to your resume.\nFrom the Resume Skills Management feature within the Resume Builder, you can add skills to your resume, or even group them together by adding a category. Drag and drop the skills to rearrange them or toggle a button to sort them from A-Z automatically.\nCreate a Free Resume\n‍\n‍\nIf you’re not sure what personal skills to highlight on your resume, head over to the Matching tab at the top of the screen, then choose a job from your job tracker.\nFrom here, Teal’s AI-powered Matching Mode will suggest what skills and keywords you should add to your resume based on the job description. Aim for an 80 percent match score.\n‍\n‍\nPersonal Skills Examples for Your Resume\nBeyond specific job skills or technical expertise, job seekers also need to bring personal skills to the table. Here are some examples of how professionals can showcase personal skills in their resume, whether you’re a new graduate or a seasoned professional.\n‍For an experienced professional\nOne common personal skill to highlight as an experienced professional is leadership. Experienced professionals are expected to guide and support others, so it’s important to demonstrate leadership skills, especially when applying to management-level roles.\nFor example, a bullet point on your resume could look like this: \n“Successfully mentored and coached junior team members, contributing to their professional development and increasing team productivity by 20%.\"\n‍\nFor a new graduate\nAs a new grad, your work history might be lighter, but you can still highlight personal skills like teamwork. Teamwork is an important skill in just about any job. As a new grad, whether you’ve completed internships or group projects in class, this is a skill you can highlight in your resume.\nFor example, you could write a bullet point for a past internship like this: \n“Collaborated effectively with a team of five to develop an Instagram strategy that increased engagement by 40%.”\n‍\nFor a professional targeting a technical role\nBe sure to highlight personal skills that complement your hard skills when applying to technical positions. Whether you’re applying for a job as a data analyst, a software engineer, or something else, highlighting your analytical skills demonstrates your ability to approach challenges logically and strategically.\nFor example, you might want to demonstrate that you have a strong analytical mind. A bullet point on your resume could look like this: \n“Analyzed customer data to identify trends and inform strategic decision-making, resulting in a 10% improvement in customer satisfaction.”\nTo further improve soft skills for your career, read our guide on interpersonal skills.\n‍\n‍\nYes, you should add personal skills to your resume\nWork experience might be the foundation of your resume, but strong personal skills are key to landing your next job. However, crafting a resume that effectively showcases these skills can be tricky.\nThat’s where Teal makes your life easier. With Teal’s AI Resume Builder, you can not only create a detailed skills section, but also use AI to generate powerful work bullet points that demonstrate your personal skills and accomplishments in context for greater impact.\nSign Up, It's Free\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is an example of a personal skill?\nWhat are personal skills and examples?\nWhat is an example of personality on a resume?","URL Slug":"best-personal-skills-resume"}}]}

Many employers are moving toward skills-based hiring, evaluating your core competencies. In fact, according to Salesforce’s 2023 digital skills survey, 82 percent of leaders surveyed stated that skills are the most important attribute when evaluating candidates. \nYour core competencies refer to your hard and soft skills, abilities, and personal qualities. If the competencies on your resume match the key qualifications listed in the job description, you have a better shot of grabbing a hiring manager’s attention.\nSystematically listing your core competencies on your resume communicates that you have the skills and attributes required for the role.\nThis guide on adding core competencies to a resume covers how to identify your core competencies and how to list core competencies on your resume.\nStruggling to land interviews with your resume? Get started with Teal’s AI Resume Builder for free.\n‍\nWhat are core competencies?\nCore competencies are attributes that show your proficiency in a particular skill or ability. Your core competencies are made up of your unique personality traits, professional experience, and key skills. These are broad one- or two-word terms that highlight what you bring to the table. \nFor example, a manager might list “Leadership” as a core competency. An event coordinator could list “Problem-solving.” A sales professional could list “Persuasion.” When done right, resume core competencies quickly illustrate your professional assets and knowledge.\n‍\nWhat do core competencies mean on a resume?\nCore competencies on a resume are typically a short list of the main attributes and strengths a candidate brings to the role. You might have a range of core competencies, but because your resume offers limited real estate, only list the ones that directly pertain to the position. \nAnother word for core competencies on a resume is core capabilities. Other near synonyms for core competencies include core qualifications, strengths, specialty, expertise and talent.\n‍\nCore competencies vs skills on resume\nWhen you’re job hunting, there’s an emphasis on putting your best skills on your resume. While eerily similar, core competencies are different from skills. So what does core competencies mean on a resume compared to skills?\nAlexandria Agresta, a leadership development expert and employee retention and wellbeing consultant explains that:\n“Core competencies encompass a broader range of attributes, including attitudes and behaviors, that are essential for organizational success often known as the ‘soft skills.’”\nIn comparison, she describes skills as:\n“Specific abilities or expertise that are often technical or task-oriented, such as proficiency in software, languages, or processes.”\nCore competencies and skills are different, though the two overlap in some ways.\n‍\n\n‍\nHere are a few examples that illustrate the differences between competencies vs. skills.\n‍\n\n‍\nTo understand the difference between core competencies and skills, check out this post on the resume skills section.\n‍\nImportance of core competencies in a resume\nResume core competencies distill your professional attributes and strengths in a couple of words or less. Including core competencies in a resume is important because they succinctly showcase your strengths.\nWhen a hiring manager is scanning resumes in seconds, your core competencies can pop out and make you stand out from other candidates.\nHaving a list of core competencies can also get your foot in the door. Many companies use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) as part of the hiring process. ATS software can pick up on specific keywords. So if your resume has competencies that match what’s in the job ad, you may have a higher chance of moving forward to the next step. \nUnderstanding which core competencies to add comes down to understanding the job description. Teal’s Matching Mode helps you add relevant keywords from the job description to your resume. Having keywords that match the role can show your core competencies to a hiring manager. \n‍\n‍\nAs a job seeker, you know there are many stages between submitting an application to getting hired. The goal of an application is to score an interview. Having the right core competencies listed could make your application rise to the top. \nKnowing which competencies to highlight when can make the difference between recruiters seeing you as a strong candidate or an average one.\n‍\nHow to identify your core competencies\nIt might be easier to identify your skills or achievements, which seem more specific and tangible. Core competencies can be more difficult to pinpoint, as they’re overarching and broader. Here’s a step-by-step guide on identifying your core competencies for your resume.\n‍\nStep 1: Take an inventory\nStart by taking an inventory of your personal traits that help you succeed in the workplace. Consider your unique capabilities and skills and how they’re used at work. \nTo identify your core competencies, Agresta shares her expertise, providing these three tips to get started:\n1. Self-Assessment: Reflect on your strengths, achievements, and feedback received from peers and supervisors. Consider the aspects of your work where you consistently excel and feel most engaged.\n\n2. Feedback: Seek input from colleagues, mentors, and supervisors who can provide insights into your strengths and areas of excellence.\n\n3. Professional Development: Engage in training, workshops, and educational opportunities to enhance and recognize your core competencies.\nUsing these tips, you can look both internally and externally to help guide you to make your own list. \n‍\nStep 2: Create a list\nAfter taking an inventory, create a list of all of your core competencies. They are typically only one or two words, not full sentences or explanations. Some core competencies examples include:\nCollaboration\nCommunication\nTeam-building \nCultural competency\nTechnical skills\nConceptual thinking\nManage Your Resume Skills for Free\n‍\n‍\nJotting down your core competencies gives you a list to choose from and return to for other job applications.\n‍\nStep 3: Narrow down options\nHere’s the tough part. Once your list is complete, narrow down your options. Since your resume has limited space, it’s generally recommended to include a maximum of five core competencies on your resume.\nDirk Matthews, senior director of Alumni Relations at Columbia College Chicago and President Elect-Elect (president in 2025) at the National Career Development Association (NCDA), recommends adding core competencies that are in demand by prospective employers. \n“When I work with students or adults in developing their careers, I have them focus on their skills and how they fit into competencies desired by employers. For example, one of the key competencies employers look for [in job seekers] is communication. Various skills make up [communication], including writing or public speaking.”\nThere’s data to back that up, too. According to The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Job Outlook 2024 report, out of eight career readiness competencies communication was rated the most important. Teamwork and critical thinking came in second and third place, respectively. \nSo while you narrow down your options, look at which core competencies are in demand. \n‍\nStep 4: Compare competencies to job descriptions\nOnce you have your short list of five core competencies, compare them to what the job requires and what the company is looking at in a candidate. Core competencies might be listed in the job description or on the company website. \nBoost Your Resume with Keywords\n‍\n‍\nIf your competencies don’t match, you may want to swap some out, replacing with options from your comprehensive list that are a better fit. \nAnd what if your core competencies don’t match at all? It might mean the position or the cultural fit isn’t ideal for you at the moment. \nIn addition to surfacing the right skills with Teal’s Matching Mode, Teal’s Resume Skills Management feature can help identify and manage your best core competencies and group them according to job families, so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel for every application.\n‍\n‍\nExamples of core competencies\nWhat are core competencies on a resume and why are they important? Core competencies include your personal strengths, certifications, and expertise. They can differentiate you from other candidates \nThere are many different types of core competencies and each company may be looking for something different. But there are some competencies that recruiters and hiring managers look for when vetting candidates. \nHere is a list of core competency examples for your resume that are in demand:\nCommunication: Shows your ability to share ideas and information clearly in a variety of ways (writing, speaking) to many different people (managers, customers, stakeholders). \nAdaptability: Highlights your ability to shift and make changes quickly in an evolving environment. \nProblem-solving: When presented with challenges, the ability to find solutions to problems when they arise. \nStrategic planning: The ability to identify a company’s long-term goals and how to reach them.\nLeadership: The skills required to inspire, motivate, and manage a team successfully. \nTeamwork: The ability to work well with others to accomplish larger goals and objectives.\nDecision-making: Navigating the complexities of making an informed decision on important matters. \nInitiative: The innate drive to pursue or complete tasks and projects without direction. \nEmpathy: Being able to put yourself in someone else’s shoes and behave in a way that takes others into consideration. \nConflict resolution: The ability to work towards a resolution among conflicting parties in a diplomatic and empathetic way.\nCustomer-centered: Working in a way that prioritizes customer satisfaction to build long-term relationships and achieve company goals. \nRelationship building: The ability to connect with others and build organic relationships with customers, staff, stakeholders, community, etc.\nAnalytical: Using critical thinking to process data and evaluate challenges and potential solutions.\nResults-driven: The ability to stay focused and motivated to achieve results with excellence.\nIntegrity: Working and behaving in a manner that upholds morals and ethics. Being honest and forthcoming, with a high level of discretion. \nDiversity: Valuing and promoting diverse communities and experiences in the workplace. \nFlexibility: The ability to go with the flow and not hold too tightly to ways of working or outcomes. \nCreativity: Generating ideas and possibilities that are outside of the box. Additionally, may refer to a person with an artistic skill set such as design, writing, photography, etc. \nTime-management: Demonstrates the ability to establish project timeframes and meet deadlines. \nDetail-oriented: The ability to look at things on a micro-level—always dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s.\nIf you’re looking for core competencies for your resume, this list is a start. You can add your own or take some from the list. Just make sure your professional experience and abilities back up your stated competencies.\n‍\n30 examples of core competencies by position\nThe list of core competencies above can provide inspiration and a starting point.

If you don’t see your role listed, you can use a position that’s skill-adjacent to help you identify your core competencies.\n‍\nHow to list core competencies on your resume\nAfter you identify core competencies, narrow them down based on the position. Once you have the list ready, here’s how to list core competencies on a resume:\n‍\nCreate a resume core competencies section \nMany people wonder where to put core competencies on a resume and the place that makes the most sense is under your name and contact information. You want them front and center so potential employers can see them right away. \n‍\nChoose a format\nRemember, your core competencies should be short and sweet. When you add them, choose a format and be consistent. You can use either bullet points or vertical lines to separate them. \nCore competencies on a resume example #1\nCommunication\nLeadership\nStrategic Planning\nCore competencies on a resume example #2\nCommunication | Leadership | Strategic Planning \n‍\nAdd them to your resume \nThe final step is to put your competencies on your resume. Double-check the spelling and formatting. Review the job description again so you can feel confident you’re adding the best ones. \nPro tip: some organizations actually publish the core competencies they’re looking for, removing the guesswork. That way everyone is on the same page with what’s needed to excel and serve in the role. Of course, you should only list the core competencies that match your strengths, so you’re not starting the relationship with a lie or getting caught in an awkward moment. \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) outlines the top eight core competencies required for special agents to excel, including: \nCollaboration\nCommunication\nFlexibility and Adaptability\nInterpersonal Ability\nInitiative\nLeadership\nProblem Solving and Judgment\nOrganizing and Planning\nIf you want to apply for a role with the FBI, identify what items on the list match your core competencies. Then you can create an FBI core competencies resume section. \nSome examples might look like:\nCommunication\nPlanning\nAdaptability \nLeadership\nOr, you could use vertical bars to keep core competencies to one line: \nCollaboration | Initiative | Problem Solving | Flexibility\nTo see if you can find any intel, search the name of the company you’re applying to and “core competencies.”\nIt’s not just companies that use core competencies either. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) published the 15 core competencies for medical students entering school:\nService orientation\nSocial skills\nCultural competence\nTeamwork\nOral communication\nEthical responsibility to self and others\nReliability and dependability\nResilience and adaptability\nCapacity for improvement\nCritical thinking\nQuantitative reasoning\nScientific inquiry\nWritten communication\nLiving systems\nHuman behavior\nAfter graduation, doctors are in a public-facing role where quick thinking and adaptability are key. They work with a range of people and handle sensitive information. AAMC clearly communicates the core competencies required to excel in this position. \nYou don’t need to work for the FBI or become a doctor for core competencies to be relevant. Every organization has them whether they publish them or not.\nUsing the Resume Skills Management feature inside Teal’s Resume Builder can streamline this process for you. \n‍\n‍\nWhy you need to add core competencies to your resume \nHaving a core competency section on your resume makes it easier for hiring managers to assess your strengths and identify whether you’re a good fit. Tailor your resume and core competencies for every job so it's specific to each role and company. \nCompanies want a candidate whose core competencies can help them fill the gaps and drive results.

Here’s how to make an informed decision:\n‍\nAssess your current skills and experience\nStart by evaluating your existing skill set and identifying gaps that could be holding you back from your dream remote job. Consider using self-assessment tools and seeking feedback from colleagues or mentors. Align your certification choices with your career aspirations and the skills most in-demand for your target remote roles.\n‍\nResearch industry demand and job market trends\nStay informed about remote job market trends by:\nUsing job search platforms to analyze in-demand skills for remote positions\nFollowing industry blogs and reports on remote work trends\nNetworking with professionals in your target field to gain insights\nIdentify certifications that are frequently mentioned in job postings for your desired remote worker roles. This ensures that your investment in a certification will yield tangible results and benefits in your remote job prospects and search—because you’re building the qualifications employers are already looking for.\n‍\nConsider time and financial investment\nWeigh the costs of certification programs against the potential career advancement benefits. For example, is it worth the certification fees and study material costs? Is it worth the time required for preparation and taking the exam? Weigh these factors against the potential salary increase or new job opportunities you’d get with your certification.\nWhen you’re researching certifications, develop a realistic study schedule that balances your current work commitments with your certification goals. Consider starting with a less time-intensive certification to build momentum and confidence before tackling more challenging ones.\n‍\nMaximizing the value of your certifications\nOnce you’ve earned your certifications, it’s crucial to leverage them effectively in your search for jobs and career development.\n‍\nUpdate your resume and online profiles\nIt’s crucial to showcase your new certifications on your resume and professional profiles, so human resources professionals like recruiters and hiring managers can quickly spot your qualifications.\nThis is also a great way to help make your resume stand out with applicant tracking systems (ATS), as there may be filters for resumes that have these certifications.\nSo, how do you list them?\nOn your resume, if you have multiple certifications, list them in a dedicated section. \n‍\nTeal's AI Resume Builder has a certifications section where you can list all your certification titles, dates and details.\n‍\nIf you have one certification, you can include it in your professional summary.\n‍\nCreate an effective professional summary in seconds with Teal's AI Professional Summary Generator.\n‍\nOn your LinkedIn and other professional profiles, update your profile’s “Licenses & Certifications” section. You can also update your headline and summary on your LinkedIn profile to reflect your new qualifications.\n‍\nLeverage certification communities\nMany certifications come with access to professional communities. Make the most of these networks by:\nJoining LinkedIn groups related to your certifications\nParticipating in online forums and discussions\nAttending virtual events and webinars to expand your professional network\nSharing your certification journey on social media to attract potential employers\nThis is a great way to meet like-minded individuals and learn more about their career journeys—and you never know when a job opportunity might come your way!\n‍\nContinue your education and recertification\nWhile getting a certification is exciting, there’s always more to learn. Stay current with industry changes and maintain the value of your certifications. \nMake sure to keep track of recertification requirements and deadlines. For example, some certifications may require you to accumulate a certain number of continuing education units (CEUs) to maintain your certification, including going to workshops, taking online courses, or participating at conferences.\nWhether you consider pursuing advanced levels of certifications to further distinguish yourself, or keep an eye out for new certifications that come up that can help you be a pioneer in your field, certifications are a great way to level up your career.\n‍\nNavigating the remote job market with your new certifications\nOnce you've secured the right certifications, it’s time to put them to work in your job search.\n‍\nTailor your job search using your credentials\nFocus on positions that value your newly acquired certifications:\nUse job boards specializing in remote work, such as We Work Remotely or Remote.co\nSet up job alerts for remote positions matching your certifications\nLeverage your certification provider’s job board or career resources, if available\nReady to supercharge your remote job search? Teal’s Job Search board can help you organize and prioritize remote and hybrid job opportunities that align with your new certifications.\n‍\n‍\nPrepare for remote job interviews\nWhen interviewing for the remote worker positions, be well prepared to showcase your certifications and remote work readiness to human resources professionals and hiring managers.\nStart by preparing examples of how you’ve applied your certified skills in real-world scenarios for behavior questions. Then, compare your knowledge and certifications to the job requirements, and prepare answers on how your knowledge and certifications match the company's interests.\nFinally, because you’re preparing for remote interviews, be prepared to speak about your proficiency with remote collaboration tools and your ability to work independently. Because working remotely is more common, you may not get specific questions on this topic, but it’s still important to demonstrate your proficiency working and collaborating remotely. \n‍\nLeverage certifications during salary discussions\nYou can use your certifications as leverage when discussing compensation: \nResearch salary ranges for remote positions requiring your certifications\nArticulate how your certified skills add value to the company\nConsider the total compensation package, including remote work benefits like flexible hours or home office stipends\n‍\nSecure a remote job with Teal\nIn the evolving world of remote work, certifications serve as powerful tools to enhance your career prospects and earning potential.

The good news: AI isn't as daunting as it sounds. By the time you finish reading this article (which we wrote with some help from ChatGPT, by the way!), you'll have more confidence in your job search process and know how to use ChatGPT like your own professional resume writer.\n\nLet's dive into the basics: What ChatGPT is, how you can make the most of it as a job seeker, and which prompt examples to use to create a standout resume.\n\n‍\n\n\n‍\n\nWhat's ChatGPT?\nChatGPT (which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a groundbreaking artificial intelligence tool making waves for its sophisticated use of natural language processing (NLP) technology—and an AI language model called GPT-3—to help people communicate with computers more naturally and intuitively, and the results produce some incredibly human-like text.\n\nIn fact, GPT-3 is such a powerful tool that we've incorporated it into our AI resume creator, so you can create cover letters tailored to particular roles and write bullet points and professional summaries for your resume without having to toggle back and forth between ChatGPT and your Resume Builder. (There are even more GPT-3 integrations coming soon!)\n\n‍\n\nThe benefits of using ChatGPT in your job search\nThe average job search can take quite some time—so it's no wonder job seekers want to do everything they can to speed up the process and land their dream job as quickly as possible.\n\nChatGPT is a powerful tool, and when used strategically, it can help job seekers in today's competitive job market reach their career goals even faster.\n\nFive key benefits of leveraging artificial intelligence throughout your job search process:\n\nIt saves time. ChatGPT can help you quickly generate quality resumes, cover letters, and other job search materials, saving you hours compared to writing everything from scratch.\nIt improves the quality of your job search materials. It's unlikely that materials generated by ChatGPT will be 100% perfect—but they're a great starting point. By providing you with prompts, suggestions, and even relevant keywords to include, ChatGPT can help improve the quality of your job search materials and highlight your strengths and accomplishments in a way that aligns with what recruiters are searching for in applicant tracking systems and catches the attention of hiring managers.\nIt increases your chances of getting an interview. One of the best ways to stand out in a crowded job market and impress potential employers is to submit a tailored resume to the role you're applying to—but when you're applying to hundreds of roles, you need a way to do that at scale. You can do it with a purpose-built resume builder (like the Teal Resume Builder) or get similar results from ChatGPT. Either way, customizing your resume so that it highlights the relevant skills for a specific job demonstrates not only your qualifications but also your understanding of what the potential employer is looking for and can increase your chances of getting an interview.\nIt helps you stand out from other applicants. We can hear the concern now: \"But what if ALL job seekers start to use ChatGPT for the resume-writing process? Won't that make everyone's materials look and sound exactly the same?\" Not necessarily. With the right ChatGPT prompts tailored to your specific needs (and to a wide range of job descriptions), you can differentiate yourself and present the most confident version of yourself to recruiters and hiring managers.\nIt builds your confidence. This brings us to our next point. The job search process can be stressful, exhausting, and challenging for your mental health—but ChatGPT can help you feel more confident in your job search by providing you with guidance and support, which, in turn, can help you stay motivated and focused on your job search goals. One of the most anxiety-inducing parts of the job application process: Interviews. And the way ChatGPT can help you with preparation is unparalleled (for example, explaining exactly how your work history and professional background tie into the requirements listed in specific job postings).\n‍\n\nCan ChatGPT write a resume?\nYep—and so much more.\n\nThere are countless ways to use ChatGPT for your resume, whether for core tasks (like crafting bullet points for your resume, writing cover letters, and optimizing your LinkedIn profile) or more complex use cases (like identifying the relevant keywords in a specific job posting so you know exactly what skills to highlight, turning your existing resume into one that better aligns with the job requirements, and even preparing interview questions for your potential employers).\n\nThe best part about ChatGPT is that it allows you to automate the more tedious aspects of your job search, which gives you more time to be strategic about your process and submit quality applications to more jobs at scale.\n\nIn this article, we'll focus specifically on the best ChatGPT prompts to use for your resume.\n\n‍\n\nWhat are ChatGPT prompts?\nPrompts are suggestions, questions, or ideas for what ChatGPT should write or say next and are based on the context of the conversation or the topic being discussed—something that sets ChatGPT apart from a standard Google search.\n\nThe more unique and specific the prompt, the more powerful the output will be. For example, let's say you're job searching but don't have an example resume or resume template to work off of.\n\nYou could type into ChatGPT, \"I'm a software engineer. Write 5 bullet points for my resume.\"\n\nChances are the results would be good—but if you just get a little more specific with your prompt (e.g., \"Write 5 bullet points with metrics for a software engineer based on the following job description, and include the keywords machine learning, Python, and Java\") and the results will be even more impactful.\n\nHere are five best practices to get the most out of ChatGPT prompts for your resume:\n\nBe specific: When using ChatGPT for your job search, it's important to choose prompts that are specific to the role you're applying for. This will help you create materials that are tailored to the position and demonstrate your relevant skills and experience.\nCustomize the prompts: ChatGPT prompts can be a great starting point, but it's important to customize them for your specific situation. Use the prompts as a guide and adapt them to your own experiences and achievements. You can even specify things like tone of voice and word or character count.\nUse multiple prompts: Don't rely on just one or two prompts to create your job search materials; instead, use multiple prompts to generate a range of responses tailored to your specific career goals.\nEdit and proofread: Just like any other writing, it's important to edit and proofread anything generated by ChatGPT before submitting it. Make sure the content flows well, the wording is typo- and error-free, and the metrics are accurate. You should be able to speak to every bullet point on your resume if asked about it in an interview.\nUse ChatGPT prompts as a supplement, not a replacement: While ChatGPT can be a helpful tool for job applicants in their search, it shouldn't replace your own creativity and perspective. The results are meant to provide suggestions—not be copied and pasted word-for-word. Think of these ChatGPT resume prompts as a supplement to your own ideas and insights, not a replacement entirely.\n‍\n\nHow to use ChatGPT prompts for resume writing\nNow that you understand the basics of ChatGPT and how it can help your resume stand out, let's get into the various ways you can use ChatGPT to write your resume—and the exact ChatGPT prompts to use for the best results.\n\nWe'll touch on four main ways to use ChatGPT to write a high-quality resume:\n\nCreate a resume from scratch\nTailor your existing resume to better match specific job descriptions\nWrite effective resume bullet points\nCraft resume summaries and professional summaries\nBefore we get started, you'll want to grab a copy of your resume.

The prompt we used: “Write resume achievements with metrics based on these job responsibilities.” Then paste the job description into ChatCPT and watch the magic happen! ✨ Save this post to try it later. #chatgpt #chatgpt3 #jobsearch #resumetips #careertok #resume #jobseeker ♬ If We Ever Broke Up - Mae Stephens\n‍\n\nUse these ChatGPT prompts to write a summary of your experience\nShould you include a professional summary at the top of your resume?\n\nLike many other parts of the job search, the answer is nuanced. The short answer: it depends. Some recruiters and HR professionals would argue that resume summaries are a waste of precious space— but we think they can be helpful if you have a longer work history (roughly five-plus years of experience), as they're an opportunity to talk about your career in aggregate.\n\nIf you're a job seeker with less than five years of experience, skip the professional summary and jump right into your most recent work experience instead; if you're a recent graduate with no work history, start with your educational qualifications and relevant certifications. No matter what, don't take up valuable resume real estate with an objective statement. (Anyone reading it will know your goal is to get the job!)\n\nAnother friendly reminder that although ChatGPT can provide suggestions, they're not always 100% accurate. Edit as needed to make sure the metrics are correct and the tone and voice sound like you.\n\nHere's how to leverage ChatGPT's ability to summarize and synthesize information and craft a professional summary:\n\nPull up the job listing you're interested in in the Teal Job Application Tracker.\nIn another tab or window, pull up a copy of your resume in the AI Resume Builder.\nOpen ChatGPT in a third tab or window.

For example, content managers with an understanding of AI workflows are paid higher than regular content managers.  \nFor example, you might have a experience in data analysis and decide to pursue a certification that deepens your expertise in a specific tool or technique. This would make you more competitive in roles that require advanced analytical capabilities.\n‍\n2. Evaluate certification providers\nNot all certifications are created equal. Here’s what to look for:\nCheck the reputation and recognition of the certifying organization: Is it a name that carries weight?\nFor example, certifications by Google or Harvard X are more reputed than an Edtech startup. \nLook for providers that offer unlimited access to course materials and quizzes so you can refer to your course when you’re in a position to implement the learnings. Download course content from free courses online where your access expires after completion.\nRead reviews and testimonials from past participants: What are others saying about their experience? Does it cover the skills you’ve shortlisted? Does it include helpful downloadable templates or checklists?\n‍\n3. Consider your time commitment and learning style\nMake sure the certification fits your lifestyle:\nAssess the time required to complete the certification: Can you realistically commit?\nDetermine if the learning format suits your preferences: Do you thrive on video lectures or do you prefer reading?\nCheck if there's flexibility in completion deadlines: Can you pause and resume as needed?\n‍\nHow to get the most out of your online certifications \nOnline certifications should collect dust in your digital drawer.

And they might prevent your resume from passing the initial screening. While one or two small oversights may not disqualify you, they can certainly raise questions and doubts.\nThe good news? Most resume red flags are completely avoidable. Below, you'll learn the top thirteen resume red flags and some ways (and tools) to avoid them, so your resume gets noticed for all the right reasons.\nStruggling to get interviews with your resume? Sign up for Teal's resume maker to avoid resume red flags.\n‍\nUnderstanding resume red flags\nRed flags on your resume are anything that might make a recruiter or hiring manager hesitate to move you forward What many people think of as red flags, like frequent job hopping or employment gaps, aren't always the biggest issues.\nRed flags can be anything from small typos to larger concerns that make someone question a candidate's qualifications or professionalism. For example, listing a current job with no achievement-based bullets for several years might seem a bit off. Or a resume with complicated formatting or too much personal info could be distracting.\nAt the end of the day, red flags are warning signs that suggest you may not be the right fit.\n‍\n‍\nWhy resume red flags matter\nRecruiters and hiring managers use red flags to filter out those job seekers who may not be the best or most qualified for a position. This helps streamline the hiring process to focus on the most promising job candidates.\n‍\nImpact of resume red flags\nWhen a recruiter or hiring manager spots resume red flags, it can overshadow your actual qualifications and experience.\nFor example, if you're a job seeker who has a resume with multiple spelling errors, it suggests a lack of attention to detail. A resume with inconsistent formatting can indicate a disorganized approach. These seemingly small issues can make it difficult for recruiters to trust your judgment or reliability.\nThe major takeaway? Resume red flags can lead to missed opportunities. Even when you're highly qualified for a position, red flags can cause your resume to be overlooked in favor of a candidate who presents their qualifications better.\nBuild a Resume Worth Noticing\n‍\n13 resume red flags\nYou know why they matter and the impact they can have on your job search; now it's time to learn the most common red flags in a resume and how to fix them.\n‍\nResume red flag #1: Lack of results\nOne of the top resume mistakes made by job seekers is listing responsibilities instead of quantifiable bullets that highlight results. Employers want to see what you've accomplished, not just what you were asked to do.\nResponsibilities are your job duties; accomplishments are the highlights; results and impact are what you achieved.\nHow to fix it: Focus on quantifiable bullets. Use metrics, percentages, and concrete numbers to showcase your successes.\nFor example, instead of saying, \"Managed a team of sales representatives,\" say, \"Managed a team of 10 sales representatives who exceeded sales targets by 20% each quarter.\" This highlights your impact and demonstrates tangible outcomes.\n‍\nPro Tip: If you're feeling stuck, try Teal’s AI to highlight your accomplishments. With Teal's customizable AI, you can add relevant keywords, write prompts, or attach the job description to align the output with any role—all in the same place you write your resume.\nAdd Results With AI\n‍\n‍\nResume red flag #2: Graphics or heavy design\nWhile creative designs might look impressive, they often can't be parsed by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), meaning your resume might not even be seen by a recruiter.\nATS are used by many companies to file and sort resumes, and they often struggle to scan non-standard formats correctly.\nGraphics and heavy designs can also distract from the content of your resume. Recruiters need to quickly find key information, and a cluttered layout can make this difficult. Instead of focusing on aesthetics, prioritize clarity and readability.\nHow to fix it: Use a clean, simple format. Avoid images and graphics so your resume can be parsed by the ATS. Teal's ATS-friendly templates are simple and come in creative, modern, and traditional formats.\n‍\nResume red flag #3: Generic employment history\nVague or generic experience details (this also includes generic AI-generated content) can make it hard for recruiters to understand your unique skills. Phrases like \"Responsible for managing projects\" don’t give enough information about what you actually did or the impact it made.\nThe bottom line? The areas of expertise on your resume should be unique and specific.\nHow to fix it: Provide specific examples of accomplishments and results. And use action verbs and quantify your bullet points where possible. Instead of using generic descriptions, provide concrete examples of your accomplishments.\nFor example, \"Led a cross-functional team to deliver a new product line, resulting in a 15% increase in revenue within the first year.\"\n‍\nIf you're not sure how much or how little detail you need, Teal's Built-In Resume Guidance provides detailed directives for each section of your resume so you know what you need to talk about and how specific you need to be.\n‍\n\n‍\nResume red flag #4: Irrelevant information\nIncluding too many irrelevant jobs or details can make your resume seem unfocused. This can look like listing hobbies, personal interests, or jobs that have no relation to the position.\nYour resume should be a targeted document that highlights your relevant experience. Irrelevant information can clutter your resume and make it hard for a hiring professional to see your value quickly.\nHow to fix it: Showcase the top ten percent of your experience that's one hundred percent relevant to the job. Remove details that don't directly support your application or the specific role you're targeting.\n‍\nResume red flag #5: Failure to tailor\nSending the same resume for every job application is one of the biggest resume red flags. Why? Well, just like no two jobs are the same, no two resumes should be either.\nEmployers want to see that you’ve taken the time to tailor your resume to their specific needs. And a generic resume suggests a lack of effort and understanding of the specific role.\nTailoring your resume (and cover letter!) involves customizing it to highlight the skills, experiences, and bullets most relevant to the job. This shows that you have a clear understanding of the job requirements and how your background makes you a strong candidate.\nHow to fix it: Align your details with the unique job description. Customize each application to highlight your most relevant experience. Use the job description as a guide to identify the key skills and qualifications that you should emphasize on your resume.\n‍\nIf you want to see where you stand quickly, Teal's Matching Mode gives you a Match Score, so you can see how your resume compares to a job.\nCompare Your Resume\n‍\n‍\nResume red flag #6: Missing keywords\nMany companies use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to file resumes. Missing crucial keywords can prevent you from being found by a human recruiter searching the system for specific skills and qualifications.\nKeywords are terms relevant to the job you're applying for. And they're usually found in the job description.\nHiring professionals search for these terms to find a candidate's resume that matches the job description. If your resume doesn’t include the right language, it may be automatically filtered out.\nHow to fix it: Identify important keywords from the job description and incorporate them into your resume.\n‍\nFollow these steps:\nRead the job description carefully\nIdentify important keywords and phrases (especially frequently used words or phrases)\nMatch these keywords to your skills and experience\nIncorporate the keywords naturally into your resume\nReview and make sure the keywords fit the context of your accomplishments\n‍\nPro Tip: Want to skip the steps above? Teal's Job Application Tracker and AI Resume Builder pull the top keywords from any job description as hard skills, soft skills, and other important language. Then, easily add them to your resume.\nFind JD Keywords\n‍\n‍\nResume red flag #7: Incorrect length\nNo resume is the perfect length. But there are some guidelines that can help you decide what works best for your experience.\nYou don't need to be a resume genius to understand that long resumes can overwhelm recruiters as they're difficult to read with too much detail. On the flip side, resumes that are too short might not provide enough information about your work history and qualifications. At the end of the day, the ideal length for a resume depends on your experience level and industry.\nHow to fix it: Aim for one to three pages, depending on your experience and industry standards. Balance detail with brevity to keep it concise and comprehensive.\nFor entry-level positions, a one-page resume is usually enough. For more experienced candidates, a two- to three-page resume may be more appropriate.\nThe key? Everything on your resume should be relevant to the job, and there should be enough information for a hiring manager to connect what you've done to what they need.\n‍\nResume red flag #8: Inconsistent formatting\nInconsistent formatting can make your resume hard to read and give an impression of carelessness. This includes variations in font sizes, styles, and the overall layout.\nA consistently formatted resume is easier to read and looks more professional. It shows you pay attention to detail and take pride in your work.\nHow to fix it: Use a consistent format throughout your resume. Here are some ways to do it:\nBalance white space\nUse clear headers, and maintain uniform bullet points. Here are a few tips:\nUse the same font style and size throughout\nAlign your text\nUse resume bullet points to list achievements\nAlign bullet points, dates, and job titles\n‍\nRather than submitting a poorly formatted resume that takes hours to structure, Teal's customizable formatting does all of the work for you without the need for manual adjustments.\nFormat Your Resume\n‍\n‍\nResume red flag #9: Misleading claims\nLying on your resume (or even heavily exaggerating) has a cost. And it can lead to serious consequences if discovered by employers. Misleading claims can damage your reputation and result in job offers being rescinded.\nEven if you have employment gaps or what feels like excessive job hopping, honesty is the best policy when it comes to your career history.\nRecruiters and hiring managers can verify your employment and most additional claims through background checks and references, so it’s important to be truthful about your qualifications and experience.\nHow to fix it: Highlight your genuine achievements in a way that makes sense for the job you're applying to. Focus on presenting your real strengths and accomplishments in a positive light. Remember, you actually want to be able to do the job.\n‍\nResume red flag #10: Incorrect or missing contact information\nMissing or incorrect contact details can prevent people from reaching you. This includes your phone number, email address, and even your LinkedIn profile.\nMaking sure your contact information is accurate and up-to-date is crucial for communication. Even a simple mistake like an incorrect digit in your cell number can mean missed opportunities.\nHow to fix it: Regularly update your resume and double-check your contact information to ensure accuracy. Make sure your email address and phone number are correct, and include a link to your LinkedIn profile URL if applicable.\n‍\nResume red flag #11: Unprofessional email address\nUsing an unprofessional email address can make you seem less serious about a job application (or about your career as a whole). TLDR? It's definitely time to say goodbye to deltachifratparty0770@aol.com.\nEmail addresses that include nicknames, slang, or other unprofessional elements can create a negative impression and are a major resume red flag.\nHow to fix it: Create a professional email address using a format like firstname.lastname@example.com. If your preferred email address is already taken, consider adding a middle initial or your industry to make it unique.\n‍\nResume red flag #12: Personal information\nIncluding personal information like your political stance, marital status, or other unrelated details isn't just irrelevant but can also lead to unconscious bias and distract from your key accomplishments..\nHow to fix it: Personal information that isn't directly related to your qualifications or job performance should be omitted from your resume. Stick to professional details only. Keep your resume focused on your relevant skills, experience, and achievements.\n‍\nResume red flag #13: Spelling and grammar mistakes\nTypos and grammatical errors can make you appear unprofessional and inattentive to detail.\nProofreading your resume is essential to ensure it's free of errors. Even a single typo can detract from the professionalism of your resume and reduce your chances of landing an interview.\nHow to fix it: Use a spell-check tool or have someone proofread your resume. Watch out for common errors and ensure your resume is polished and professional.\nHere are a few tips:\nRead your resume out loud\nUse a spell-check tool\nAsk a friend or colleague to review your resume\n‍\nAvoid resume red flags with Teal\nResume red flags can derail your job applications, but avoiding them can easily boost your chances of landing an interview for your dream job.

It can give the impression you're out of touch with current job market trends and probably doesn’t highlight your value in a way that's relevant to each job.\nBut what exactly makes your resume outdated? And how can you fix it?\nBelow, you'll learn the telltale signs your resume needs a refresh and how to update it quickly—without the frustration of starting from scratch.\n‍\n‍\nStruggling to land interviews with an outdated resume? Try Teal's Resume Builder with easy import and update yours for free.\n‍\nWhat is an outdated resume?\nAn outdated resume is one that doesn't align with current job market best practices for content, formatting, and design.\nIt might contain irrelevant information, lack clear sections and impactful bullet points, or fail to align with the specific job you're applying for.\nApplying for jobs with an outdated resume can hurt you during the hiring process. Why? Hiring professionals have limited time. In fact, with so many job applicants, recruiters spend only a few seconds reviewing your personal details on the first pass. An outdated resume may immediately (whether right or wrong) signal you aren't current in your industry or serious about your job search.\nFortunately, there are a few clear signs to look for.\n‍\n11 signs your resume is outdated\nMaybe you haven't updated your resume for the past few years. (Or maybe you've never updated it at all.) In either case, if you're asking, 'Is my resume outdated?' and spot any of these red flags, it's time for a revamp.\n‍\nSign 1: You include a physical address\nIncluding a full street address in your resume contact information is no longer necessary. Your address takes up valuable space. Instead, just list your city, state, and zip code.\n‍\nSign 2: You use an outdated email address\nAn old email like sweetiepie99@hotmail.com isn't great for your professional image. Stick with a current, straightforward address using your name and a modern provider like Gmail.\n‍\nPro Tip: Teal’s Built-in Guidance walks you through each resume section so you’re never left guessing about what to include or what doesn’t belong.\n‍\nSign 3: You use a resume objective\nResume objectives have fallen out of favor. Rather than focusing on what you hope to achieve in your next role or your career goals, a tailored professional summary that highlights your most relevant skills and experience is a more modern option.\n‍\nSign 4: You list all of your work history dating back to your first job\nUnless you're an entry-level candidate and this is your first resume, there's no need to include every position you've ever held. \nFocus on the last 10 to 15 years of relevant experience to keep your resume concise. The recruiter for a Director of Content Marketing at a tech company doesn't need to know about the swim lessons you taught in high school or college.\nStill not sure? Check out this guide for how many jobs you should list on a resume.\n‍\nSign 5: Your resume lacks results and achievements\nOne of the biggest resume mistakes to avoid is just listing your responsibilities. Today's resumes need to go beyond simply listing job duties. What did you do? How did this impact the business? Incorporate measurable accomplishments and outcomes to show results.\nPro Tip: AI makes it easy to write standardized and impactful bullet points for every job.\nWrite Achievements With AI\n‍\n‍\nSign 6: You include references or \"references available upon request\"\nHiring managers assume you'll provide references if needed, so there's no reason to use resume space on this outdated phrase. Rather than adding references to a resume, have a separate reference sheet ready to provide when asked.\n‍\nSign 7: Lack of clear sections and headings\nA cluttered resume with poor organization and a hard-to-distinguish resume format is difficult for both human readers and applicant tracking systems (ATS) to navigate. Use clear section headings to break up content and guide the reader through your qualifications.\n‍\nSign 8: Large blocks of text instead of bullet points\nDense paragraphs are hard to read quickly and can obscure key details. Use concise resume bullet points starting with strong action verbs to make your accomplishments (and impact!) stand out.\n‍\nSign 9: No updated certifications or continuing education\nIf a certification or similar accolade is no longer relevant or expired, it doesn't belong on your resume. In addition, in today's evolving workplace, it's important to show you've invested in ongoing professional development.\nHighlight your most recent and relevant certifications on your resume and remove outdated details.\n‍\nSign 10: Your resume isn't tailored to the job description\nGeneric, one-size-fits-all resumes simply don't cut it in today's job market. Compared to just five years ago, there are significantly more applicants vying for each position. As the market trends towards global hiring, you’re competing with the world—not just your city.\nRather than using one resume for every job application, analyze the job posting for key requirements, language, and other important details and tailor your content accordingly. This targeted approach shows how you’re a strong fit for the role and sets you apart from the competition.\nCompare Your Resume to a Job\n‍\n‍\nSign 11: Your resume isn't optimized for ATS systems\nAs the market becomes more digital, many companies rely on applicant tracking systems (ATS) to scan and organize resumes. These digital filing systems have to be able to parse your resume correctly. Optimizing your content and layout for these systems with an ATS resume is crucial to avoid an unreadable resume.\n‍\nHow to fix an outdated resume using Teal\nNow that you know how to spot an outdated resume, you can fix those issues in a few steps with Teal's AI Resume Builder.\nFirst, all you need to do is create a Teal account and upload your current resume to get started—no copying and pasting or trying to toggle between your resume and another program.\n‍\nMake sure all of your details scan into the correct sections, then, because you have an existing resume, run a Resume Analysis.\nTeal's Resume Analysis will help you identify:\nQuality issues\nMisalignments with modern best practices\nOpportunities to improve sections of your resume with strategic suggestions\nTeal's suggestions will help you create a more modern document that makes a better impression on potential employers.

It's time to upgrade to a more professional email address that incorporates your name. Platforms like Gmail, Hotmail, and Outlook are free to use.\n‍\nFix 3: Replace your objective statement with a professional summary\nYou're applying for a job. A hiring manager will assume you want the position; you don't need to tell them. Remove any details about your goals or why you want a specific job.\nA good professional summary showcases your most impressive skills and experiences. Think of this section as your highlight reel.\nIf you're feeling stuck on what to say, try Teal's generative AI.\nTeal's AI condenses your experience in an impactful way so you can present a high-level overview of your best professional accomplishments.\nUpdate Your Summary With AI\n‍\n‍\nFix 4: Focus on relevant, recent experience\nUnless you have a large gap in your career, your resume should only include your most relevant and recent positions from the last 10 to 15 years.\nAnd everything you incorporate should be aligned with the specific job you're applying for.\nWith Teal, you can check (or uncheck) the boxes next to the most relevant experience for each unique job without deleting important details.\n‍\nFix 5: Highlight accomplishments with impact\nWhile what you've done in each position is certainly important, what's more important is how you've done it and the results you achieved.\n‍\nIf you're having trouble formulating resume bullet points, try the formula below:\nSuccess Verb (e.g., increased, improved, reduced) + Noun + Metric + [Strategy Optional] + Outcome = 1 bulleted achievement\n‍\nFor example:\nOriginal resume bullet point:\nResponsible for managing social media accounts and creating content\nImproved resume bullet point:\nBoosted social media engagement by 40% within 6 months by implementing a data-driven content strategy and leveraging user-generated content, resulting in increased brand awareness and a 25% increase in website traffic.\n‍\nBut don't work harder than you have to. Teal also has an AI for your achievements to help you write resume bullet points that align closely with the job you're applying for.\nWith Teal's AI, you can match your resume to a specific job description, add a specific prompt, or suggest keywords to customize the output, then let AI take care of the rest.\nWrite Resume Bullet Points With AI\n‍\n‍\nFix 6: Remove references sections\nDelete references unless a particular company asks for them during the application process—this includes the phrase \"references available upon request.\"\nThe outdated practice of adding references on a resume wastes valuable real estate that could be used to showcase more of your achievements and impact to potential recruiters and employers.\n‍\nFix 7: Organize with clear sections and headings\nEach section of your resume should have a clear header and title so hiring professionals know what they're looking at.\nUse Teal's Drag-and-Drop Editor to arrange or even rename your sections in the order that works best for your experience.\nFor example, if you're applying to a role in a more technical field, move your Skills section beneath your professional summary to immediately highlight you have the right aptitudes for the job.\n‍\nFix 8: Use concise bullet points\nReplace lengthy paragraphs with concise bullet points that are easy to scan.\nYour resume bullet points should:\nQuantify your achievements with relevant data and metrics to demonstrate your impact.\n\nFor example: \"Increased sales revenue by 25% within the first quarter by implementing a new marketing strategy.\"\nFocus on the specific actions you took and the results you achieved rather than just listing your responsibilities.\nHighlight your most relevant skills and experiences that align with the job description. Use industry-specific keywords to make it easy for a recruiter to find your resume when they search an ATS for specific skills or qualifications.\n\n‍\nFix 9: Showcase only your latest training and certifications\nRemove any outdated or expired certifications. If you have any updated accreditations or certificates, add a dedicated \"Certifications\" or \"Professional Development\" section to highlight your most recent and relevant qualifications.\n‍\nFix 10: Tailor your resume to each job\nEvery job description is different. And that means no two resumes should be the same. Each time you apply, your resume (and cover letter!) should showcase the experience that is relevant to that unique job.\nUse Teal's Matching Mode to see how your content stacks up to a specific posting. Teal will give you a Match Score with a breakdown of how well your resume aligns with the language, keywords, and skills of the job with optimization suggestions for improvement. Just incorporate the suggestions to increase your score to 60-75%.\nMatch Your Resume to a Job\n‍\nFix 11: Optimize for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)\nThe ATS are electronic databases used as digital filing systems. They help hiring professionals get organized, and job seekers get found through quick keyword searches.\nWhile the ATS aren't bots trying to auto-reject your resume, they do need your resume to be scannable so it can be read (and searched for) by a human hiring professional.\nTeal's simple resume templates and PDF download option are designed for ATS compatibility.\n‍\nSome other ways to optimize for the ATS are:\nUse clear headings\nOnly rely on simple formatting\nIncorporate relevant keywords throughout each section\nAvoid using images, charts, or other graphics that may not be parsed correctly\n‍\nRevamp your outdated resume with Teal\nBy identifying outdated elements and leveraging Teal's tools for targeted fixes, you can create a polished, impactful, modern resume that resonates and increases your chances of landing interviews.\nTeal's AI Resume Builder offers tools like Matching Mode, Resume Analysis, and a Drag-and-Drop Editor to help you quickly update and optimize every section of your resume for maximum impact.\nDon't let an outdated resume hold you back from landing a new job.\nSign Up For Teal Today\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is considered outdated on a resume?\nAre resumes outdated?\nDo employers really care what your resume looks like?\nWhat are three items that should not go into a resume?","URL Slug":"signs-resume-outdated-fixes"}}]}

Small errors can be costly. Strategic improvements? These can open the doors.\nIn this article, you'll learn 20 resume dos and don'ts that can help you sidestep errors and focus on what matters. From highlighting your qualifications with metrics to aligning your experience with job requirements, these tips will guide you in writing a stand-out resume—free of avoidable mistakes.\n‍\nWant to avoid resume mistakes from the start? Use Teal's resume maker with built-in analysis to identify gaps and areas for improvement.\n‍\nWhat is a resume?\nA resume is a document that summarizes your professional experience, education, and skills. Often your first point of contact with a prospective employer, this document provides a brief overview of your relevant qualifications, allowing them to assess your fit for a position quickly.\n‍\nWhat makes a good resume?\nA good resume highlights your qualifications and makes a positive impression on potential employers. Above all else? It's relevant to the job you're applying for and easy to read at a glance.\n‍\nHere are some key elements to focus on that help make a resume strong:\nRelevance:  Focus on roles, achievements, and impact that showcase what you've done and align with a position's requirements.\nClarity: Use clear headings, bullet points, and consistent formatting to guide the reader through your information without confusion.\nSpecificity: Use quantifiable metrics, like \"Led a team of 10 to increase sales by 20% in one quarter,\" to demonstrate your impact.\nKeywords: Incorporate job-specific keywords and phrases found by recruiters searching Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).\nClean Design: Avoid overly complex layouts, images (if you're in the US), and graphics that can distract from your content and make it hard for your resume to parse through an ATS.\n‍\n\n‍\n20 Resume dos and don'ts\nNow that you understand what makes a good resume, it's time for the specifics. In fact, resume writing doesn’t have to be hard if you know what to focus on and what to avoid. The resume dos and don'ts below will guide you on what to include, what to sidestep, and how to present your qualifications best.\n‍\n1. Do include up-to-date contact information\nDo you have your contact information listed clearly at the top of your resume? If not, be sure to add it. All you need is city and state—no need to include a full street address or zip code.\nYou should also add a professional email address and phone number, as well as your optimized LinkedIn profile URL (linkedin.com/in/yourname). A personal website or portfolio is also a great addition. If you're updating an older resume, make sure you include the correct contact information if you want hiring managers to be able to reach you.\n \n2. Don’t include your address, age, religion or political affiliation\nYour resume should only focus on information directly related to your professional qualifications and fit for a job.\nIncluding personal details like your address, age, religion, or political affiliation is unnecessary and can lead to unintended bias or discrimination.\nBeyond bias concerns, employers simply don't care about these details. They're interested in your skills, experience, and how you can contribute to their org, and personal details take the focus away from what you bring to the table and aren't relevant. All that to say: your resume should reflect your professional persona, not personal aspects of your life.\n‍\n3. Do include a target title\nYour target title sits above your professional summary and is the title of the position you're applying for. Depending on the role and company, this may vary from application to application.\nIncluding a target title on your resume:\nMakes it clear you're applying to a specific role\nOptimizes it to be searching within the ATS for that position\nHighlights relevant experience and skills\nAlign with the job posting to connect your skills to that specific role\nNeed some inspo? Here are some examples of marketing manager resumes that nail the target title.\n‍\n4. Do customize your professional summary statement\nA professional summary offers a succinct overview of your best achievements. It's what drives a hiring manager to dig deeper into your resume. Customizing this section for each job application ensures that your experience is tailored specifically for a role.\n‍\nHere's how to customize your professional summary:\nStudy the JD: Identify the key skills and experiences the employer is looking for. Note the language and keywords (like hard and soft skills) used.\nHighlight relevant experience: Choose the most relevant experiences and bullet points that match the job description and show your results and how you got there.\nUse specific metrics: Include quantifiable accomplishments that offer proof of success in similar roles. For example, \"Developed and implemented strategy to scale AI content production 3X over Q3 using Claude, Airtable, ChatGPT, and Pipedream, resulting in an 8% month-over-month increase in organic traffic.\"\n‍\n5. Don’t use a generalized objective statement or summary\nOne of the easiest resume mistakes to make is including a career objective. Including a generalized objective statement or resume summary can make your resume blend in with the rest. Employers aren't looking for where you want to go or something irrelevant you've achieved; they want to know two things:\nWhat you've done\nCan you do it again for them\nAvoid vague statements like \"Seeking a challenging position in a reputable company\" and discussing your career goals. Just focus on showcasing your value prop and how it aligns with the specific role you're applying for.\n‍\n6. Do highlight relevant experience and skills\nOne of the most important resume best practices is that your resume should emphasize the experience and skills that are most applicable to the job you're applying for.\nHow do you do it?\nCarefully review the job description\nIdentify the key qualifications the employer is looking for\nHighlight your relevant work experience and skills that match those requirements and incorporate the language from the JD\nUse specific examples to demonstrate your expertise and show how your background makes you a strong candidate\n‍\n7. Don’t include work experience that's outdated or irrelevant\nListing every job you’ve ever had can clutter your resume and dilute its impact.\nFocus on the most recent and relevant positions that showcase your qualifications for the job at hand. Remove outdated or irrelevant work experience that doesn't add value to your application. This keeps your resume concise and ensures that the most important information stands out to hiring managers.\n‍\n8. Do tailor your bullets to align with the job description\nAligning your bullet points with the job description can significantly increase your chances of getting noticed.\nHere’s how to get it right:\nReview the job listing: Identify the key responsibilities and skills required.\nHighlight relevant accomplishments: Focus on achievements and examples that match relevant skills and qualifications. For instance, if the job requires leadership or technical skills, mention instances where you successfully led a project or team or the tools and tech you used for a specific result.\nIncorporate keywords: Use the terms and phrases from the JD to demonstrate alignment with the role. (This also helps your resume get found by recruiters searching Applicant Tracking Systems for specific terms.)\n‍\n9. Don’t copy the job description word for word\nAligning your resume with the job description is important, but avoid copying it verbatim. This can make your resume appear unoriginal and even dishonest.\nInstead, describe your relevant experience and skills in your own words, showcasing your unique voice. Highlight how your background aligns with the role without directly copying the description. This approach demonstrates your ability to express your qualifications clearly and effectively while showing a deeper understanding of the position and your suitability for it.\n‍\n10. Do include keywords from the job description \nYou've already heard about keywords. Incorporating keywords from job descriptions into your resume:\nMakes it searchable for specific terms that hiring managers search for within the ATS\nShows how what you have to offer aligns with a specific job\nTo find the most important keywords, identify the terms and phrases used in the job posting and weave them naturally into your resume. (Think: relevant skills, tools, and industry terminology.)\nRemember: The keywords in your work history, skills, and summary have to, at the very least, resemble the job duties for the role you’re applying for. Irrelevant keywords won't paint a clear picture as to why a recruiter should hire you over other job seekers.\n‍\nPro Tip: How can you determine what those exact words are? One way is to save the job description in Teal  and look at the highlighted keywords. Within the Job Description Keyword Finder, you’ll see the top skills you should include on your resume to increase your chances of getting an interview.\n‍\n‍\n‍\n11. Do use data and action verbs to show the impact of bullet points\nIf action verbs show movement and data offers proof, then used together in your resume, they create a powerful narrative of your impact.\nYou see, action verbs demonstrate initiative and leadership, while quantifiable data provides concrete evidence of your achievements. This combination allows a hiring manager to clearly visualize your contributions and effectiveness in previous roles.\nFor example:\nIncreased sales by 20% in six months by implementing targeted email campaigns and social media promotions, resulting in 2x revenue growth.\nReduced operational costs by 15% by optimizing supply chain management and automating routine tasks, leading to substantial savings and a 92% operational efficiency rate.\n‍\n12. Don’t exaggerate or falsify metrics\nAvoid exaggerating or falsifying metrics on your resume. While it might seem tempting to inflate your experience to get noticed, this can backfire during interviews, reference checks, or even after you've started the job. Stick to accurate and truthful representations of your accomplishments. This approach maintains your credibility and allows you to discuss your bullet points confidently throughout the hiring process.\n‍\n13. Do include your most recent and highest level of education\nWhile formal education isn't everything, this information is important to some employers as it can be a key factor in their hiring decisions. (This is one of those keywords or phrases to check the JD for!)\nList your highest level of education using the chronological resume format. Begin with your most recent educational achievement and work backward.\n‍\nYour Education section should include:\nName of the institution\nDegree earned\nGraduation date\nOptional: Any relevant honors and your GPA if it's 3.9 or above and you're a recent graduate.\nIf you have relevant certifications or additional training, be sure to include those in a separate certification section as well, as they can further demonstrate your qualifications.\n‍\n14. Don’t include irrelevant projects, volunteer work, or education\nWhile you don't necessarily need a one-page resume and adding additional experiences can be valuable, any projects, volunteer work, or education you include should be relevant to the job you're applying for.\nIrrelevant information can clutter your resume and distract from your most important qualifications. Focus on including experiences that directly support your application and demonstrate your fit for the role. This keeps your resume focused and clear.\n‍\n15. Do include hard skills\nDon't overlook hard skills on your resume. If a job listing emphasizes specific software or technical proficiencies, include your relevant experience. While an exact match isn't necessary, a significant gap could be problematic.\nFor example, if you've used CRM software and the listing mentions Salesforce and HubSpot, include these by name.\nNeed more guidance? you can find the most important hard skills by position in this collection of resume examples.\n‍\n16. Don’t include obvious soft skills \nAvoid listing obvious soft skills like \"communication,\" \"teamwork,\" or \"problem-solving\" in your resume writing. These skills are important, but they are often assumed and can make your resume seem generic. Instead, demonstrate these skills through your accomplishments and experiences.\n‍\nFor example:\nShow, don’t tell: Rather than stating you have excellent communication skills, describe a situation where you successfully led a team project or negotiated a key deal.\nBe specific: Highlight bullet points that naturally reflect your soft skills, such as \"Led a cross-functional team to complete a project ahead of schedule\" or \"Negotiated a contract that resulted in a 15% cost reduction.\"\n‍\n17. Do use active voice when writing your resume\nUsing active voice in your resume makes your bullet points clear and impactful. Active voice emphasizes your role in your accomplishments.\nFor example, here's how active voice highlights direct contribution and responsibility compared to passive voice:\nPassive voice: \"A new marketing strategy was developed, increasing sales by 20%.\"\nActive voice: \"Developed a new marketing strategy that increased sales by 20%.\"\n‍\n18. Don’t incorporate too many creative elements\nWhile incorporating creative elements in your resume can showcase your skills and dedication, overdoing it can be overwhelming. Do your best to stick to more basic resume formats and design.\n‍\nIt’s best to steer clear of:\nHard-to-read fonts\nUncommon margin sizes\nLow-contrast color combinations\nPhotos\nGraphics\nUnconventional layouts\nThese elements, while adding character, can also distract from your qualifications and make your resume difficult for both hiring managers and applicant tracking systems (ATS) to parse.\n‍\nPro Tip: For a clean, professional look, consider using Teal's free templates in the AI Resume Builder. Each template is designed to be ATS-friendly and easy to read, suitable for any industry or level.\n‍\n19. Do make sure you meet at least 70% of the job requirements\nYou don't need to meet 100% of a job's requirements to apply. Aim for roles where you match about 70-80% of the criteria.\nResearch from LinkedIn shows that women apply to 20% fewer jobs than men due to a belief that all qualifications must be met.  This simply isn't true. You don't need to meet 100% of the requirements to apply for a job.\nIn today's job search culture, everyone should feel comfortable applying—even if they don’t meet every criterion. But your resume should still reflect that you meet the basic requirements listed in the job posting.\n‍\n20. Don’t overlook the importance of a cover letter\nEven if it's not explicitly requested, including a cover letter can pair well with your application.\nCover letters provide an additional opportunity to highlight your relevant experience and explain why you’re the perfect fit for the job. Use your cover letter to personalize your application, showcase your motivation, and give more context to your top bullet points.\n‍\nCheck your resume with Teal\nIf you want to understand how resume dos and don'ts apply to your content, try Teal's Resume Analysis. Use it to find gaps, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, helping you refine your resume for better results.\n‍\n‍\nCommon resume mistakes to avoid\nEven the most well-crafted resumes can have resume mistakes that hinder your job search. In this section, you'll learn the most common resume errors to avoid so your application stands out for the right reasons.\n‍\n‍\nAvoid using the same resume for every application\nCustomizing your resume for each job application is crucial. Using the same resume for every job can make you appear unfocused and uninterested. Instead, tailor your resume to highlight the skills and experiences most relevant to the position you're applying for.\n‍\nAvoid making your resume too long\nYour resume doesn't need to be lengthy to be impactful. If you have fewer than ten years of experience or are pivoting careers, aim to keep your resume between one and two pages if possible.\nA concise resume is easier to scan and forces you to focus on the most relevant hard, soft, and transferable skills and experiences for the job you're applying to.\n‍\nAvoid using complex vocabulary\nUsing complex vocabulary or company-specific acronyms that aren't widely understood can make your resume confusing. Keep your language clear and straightforward. Here's how:\nUse common terms: Describe your skills and experiences in universally understood language.\nAvoid jargon: Only use industry-specific terms if they are well-known and relevant to the job.\n‍\nAvoid spelling and grammar mistakes\nSpelling and grammar mistakes can leave a poor impression on potential employers. They suggest a lack of attention to detail and professionalism.\nProofread your resume carefully. Review it multiple times and use spell check and grammar tools to catch any errors. Consider asking a friend or mentor to review it as well, providing a fresh perspective to catch mistakes you might have missed.\n‍\nAvoid using a generic file name\nA generic file name for your resume can make it difficult for recruiters to find and identify your document.\nBe specific: Use a resume file name that includes your full name and the position you’re applying for, such as Kayte_Grady_Senior_Copywriter_Resume.pdf. This ensures your resume stands out and is easy to locate.\n‍\nAvoid including your professional headshot\nIn the US, Including a professional headshot on your resume is generally unnecessary and can lead to unintended bias. Focus on your skills and experiences instead.\n‍\nAvoid including references in your resume\nUnless specifically requested, there's no need to include references on your resume. This can take up valuable space that could be used to highlight your qualifications.\nMaximize space: Use the space to detail your skills and experiences instead.\nProvide upon request: Be prepared to provide references when asked during later stages of the hiring process.\n‍\nCreate a strong resume with Teal\nResume dos and don'ts help you understand what works and what doesn't in today's market.

From picking a simple design to adding measurable achievement-based bullets, you'll get all the tips you need to create a resume that grabs attention and makes a strong impression.\nStruggling to create an easy-to-read resume? Make a free resume with Teal today.\n‍\nWhy you need an easy-to-read resume\nAn easy-to-read resume allows hiring professionals to spot your key qualifications and achievements quickly. A clean and professional format highlights your skills and improves your chances of being correctly parsed by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).\nAn easy-to-read resume also:\nSaves time: With hundreds of applications to review, recruiters and hiring managers can quickly digest well-organized and straightforward resumes.\nDemonstrates professionalism: A polished resume reflects your attention to detail and communication skills.\nBoosts ATS compatibility: Many companies use ATS to organize and file resumes. A simple, well-formatted resume is more likely to be successfully parsed by these systems.\n‍\n9 tips for an easy-to-read resume\nMaking your resume easy to read doesn't have to be complicated. These nine tips will help you craft a document that's easy on the eyes and packed with the right details to help you stand out during the hiring and recruitment process.\n‍\nTip 1: Keep design simple\nWhen it comes to resume design, less is more. While you want your resume to convey your personality to some extent, the primary focus should be on what you bring to the table.\n‍\n‍\nA clean, straightforward resume layout allows your qualifications to take center stage. Here's why simplicity matters:\nA clutter-free design makes it easier for hiring managers to quickly scan your information.\nComplex designs with images, graphics, or charts can confuse ATS systems, potentially causing your resume to be rejected before a human ever sees it.\nA simple design conveys a sense of maturity and focus on substance over style.\nHere's how to do it:\nStick to a clean, minimalist design with clear sections and consistent formatting.\nUse subtle design elements like lines and slightly larger headers to separate sections if needed.\nAvoid ornate borders or excessive color that could distract from your content.\nThe sample resume below shows how a clutter-free resume design makes it easy to see value quickly.\n‍\n‍\nTip 2: Choose a professional font\nThe right font can make a significant difference in your resume's readability. Opt for standard, easy-to-read fonts such as:\nPoppins\nArimo\nTinos\nRoboto\nRoboto Mono\nCrimson Pro\nOpen Sans\nWork Sans\n‍\nThese fonts are not only professional but also widely compatible with various systems. Avoid quirky or overly stylized fonts that may be difficult to read or might not render correctly on all devices.\nFont size matters, too. For body text, stick to 10-12 point font. You can go up to 14 or 16 points for section headers, but avoid anything larger, as it can look unprofessional.\nRemember: the goal is to make your resume easy to read, not to showcase your knowledge of obscure typefaces. When in doubt, choose a classic, widely used font that won't distract from your content.\n\nTip 3: Use a clear format\nA professional, well-organized resume format helps guide the reader's eye through your resume.\nChoose a common resume format like a reverse chronological resume, which lists your work experience starting with the most recent job and working backward, making it easy for recruiters to see your career progression.\nAlternatively, consider a hybrid resume that combines elements of both chronological and functional formats, allowing you to highlight your skills and experiences while still providing a clear employment history.\n‍\nYou should also:\nUse consistent spacing throughout\nAlign text to the left for easier reading\nUse bold or italics sparingly to highlight key information\nStick to a one or two-column layout\nThe key? Consistency. If you bold job titles, make sure all job titles are bold. If you use bullet points for one job description (and you should!), use them for all job descriptions. This cohesiveness creates a visual rhythm that makes your resume easier to scan and understand.\n‍\nDesign your resume with Teal\nWant to flexible resume design without a lot of tedious work?\nTeal's Design Mode offers a variety of professional templates to choose from and makes it easy to create a polished, ATS-friendly resume without the hassle of starting from scratch or manually formatting.\n‍\nWith Teal, you can:\nChoose from multiple professional templates\nCustomize resume colors and fonts to match your personal brand\nRearrange your resume sections to match your career journey\nEasily adjust spacing and formatting for a clean, polished look\nEnsure your resume is ATS-compatible\nDesign Your Resume With Teal\n‍\n‍\nTip 4: Opt for resume bullet points\nLong paragraphs can be overwhelming and difficult to skim. Instead, use bullet points to present your accomplishments and responsibilities.\nResume bullet points improve scannability, help highlight your achievements, and create white space making your resume easier on the eyes.\n‍\nHere's how to make the most of bullet points:\nStart each bullet with a strong action verb (e.g., \"Developed,\" \"Implemented,\" \"Increased\")\nFocus on bulleted achievements and results rather than just responsibilities\nKeep each resume bullet to 1-2 lines for maximum impact\nUse 3-5 bullets per job or section to avoid overwhelming the reader\nRemember, the goal is to provide a snapshot of your most impressive accomplishments that are relevant to the job you're applying for, not an exhaustive list of everything you've ever done.\n‍\nTip 5: Incorporate headings\nHeadings act as signposts, guiding the reader through different sections of your resume. Here are the section headings most hiring professionals look for.\nWork Experience\nEducation\nCertifications\nSkills\nOptional\n– Projects\n– Awards and Scholarships\n– Volunteering and Leadership\n– Publications\n‍\nNote: The headings above do not include the following resume sections: Contact Information, Target Job Title, and Professional Summary. These sections sit at the top of your resume and tend to be self-explanatory.\nFormat your headings consistently. For example, you might make them bold these words on your resume and make them slightly larger than the body text. This creates a clear visual hierarchy that guides the reader's eye through your resume.\n‍\nTip 6: Add white space\nWhite space, or negative space, is the empty area between sections in your resume. Proper use of white space reduces visual resume clutter, improves overall readability, and helps important information stand out.\n‍\nTo incorporate more white space:\nUse appropriate margins (usually 0.5 to 1 inch on all sides)\nAdd space between sections\nAvoid cramming too much information onto a single page\nUse line spacing of 1.0 to 1.15 for body text\nThink of white space as giving your content room to breathe. Just as a cluttered physical space can feel overwhelming, a resume without decent white space can be difficult to process.\nHowever, be careful not to go overboard. Too much white space can make your resume look sparse or lacking in content. Strike a balance between providing enough information and maintaining readability.\n‍\nTip 7: Keep it concise\nHiring managers and recruiters have limited time to review each resume, so a concise, focused resume is more likely to be read in its entirety.\nThe goal here is to provide a clear and impactful snapshot of your most relevant qualifications and experiences. By keeping your resume concise, you make sure that the most important information stands out and can be quickly absorbed.\n‍\nTo keep your resume focused:\nYou don't have to cram everything into a one-page resume! Aim for 1-3 pages unless you're in a field that requires a CV or more extensive detail.\nInclude only relevant experience and soft and technical skills that directly relate to the job requirements of the role you're applying for.\nUse action verbs and remove unnecessary words to keep your descriptions clear and powerful.\nTailor your resume for each job application, highlighting the most pertinent information for that specific role.\n‍\nTips for keeping your resume concise\nFocus on the last 10-15 years of experience unless earlier experience is highly relevant to the position.\nEliminate outdated resume skills or technologies that no longer add value to your application.\nRemove high school information if you have a college degree unless it's specifically relevant.\nCut \"fluff\" words and phrases that don't add substantial value to your descriptions.\nWhen in doubt, ask yourself: \"Does this information help show why I'm a great fit for this specific job?\" If the answer is no, remove it This approach ensures your resume remains impactful and easy to read.\n‍\nPro Tip: If you don't want to start a resume from scratch or delete important details every time you hit apply, the Teal AI Resume Builder stores your entire career history as one base resume.\nThen, when it's time to apply, just check the boxes next to the skills and experience relevant to that specific job—no more wasteful and time-consuming copying, pasting, or deleting.\n‍\nTip 8: Use numbers and data\nQuantifying resume achievements adds credibility. It offers concrete proof of your experience and helps hiring professionals understand the scope of your accomplishments.\nFor example:\n\nImplemented a targeted marketing strategy that increased sales by 25% over six months, boosting overall revenue and market share.\n\nDeveloped and executed a comprehensive management plan for a team of 12 developers, resulting in a 30% increase in project completion rates and improved team cohesion.\n\nDesigned and implemented enhanced training procedures, reducing customer complaints by 40% and significantly improving customer satisfaction and retention rates.\nThese specific, measurable results are more impactful than vague statements and help your resume stand out.\n‍\nTips for incorporating numbers and data:\nUse percentages to show improvement or growth\nInclude dollar amounts to demonstrate financial impact\nSpecify the size of teams or projects you've managed\nMention time frames to provide context for your bullet points\n‍\nTip 9: Avoid jargon and fluff\nWhile using industry-specific keywords is important, avoid overloading your resume with jargon or buzzwords. Instead, opt for clear, simple language that anyone can understand. Replace resume buzzwords and clichés like \"team player\" or \"think outside the box\" with specific examples.\nFor example:\n\nInstead of: \"Excellent communication skills\"\nTry: \"Delivered weekly presentations to C-level executives, resulting in approval of new $500K project\"\n\nInstead of: \"Results-oriented professional\"\nTry: \"Increased customer satisfaction scores by 15% through implementation of new service protocols\"\n‍\nRemember, your goal is to show potential employers your value clearly. Using simple language and real examples makes it easy for hiring managers to see what you bring to the table and how you can help their team.\n‍\nCreate an easy-to-read resume with Teal\nAn easy-to-read resume looks professional and quickly communicates your value to potential employers.\nWith Teal AI Resume Builder's Flexible Resume Design, you can create a clear, compelling resume that balances looks and content to highlight all of the right details without the fluff or manual work.\nDon't let a hard-to-read resume stand between you and your next opportunity.\nSign Up for Teal Today\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the easiest resume to read?\nWhy is the resume easy to read?\nHow should you format your resume to make it easily readable?","URL Slug":"easy-read-resume-tips"}}]}

Take a quick look at LinkedIn, and it's easy to find 'over 100 applicants' for just about any remote job. With so many candidates for every position, hiring professionals have only a few seconds to take the first pass on each resume. If yours is too long, too disorganized, or too detailed, it will probably be overlooked.\nIn this post, you'll learn why you should clean up your cluttered resume and seven tips to make it clearer, polished, and organized—highlighting your unique value and making it easier (and faster) for you to land an interview.\nTrying to land interviews with a cluttered resume? Sign up for Teal and clean it up today.\n‍\nWhy you should declutter your resume\nA cluttered resume can have a negative impact on your job search.\nWhen your resume is unclear, disorganized, unfocused, or full of irrelevant details that take up unnecessary space, it becomes difficult for hiring managers to identify your key qualifications and fit for the role quickly. They can easily miss important information because it's buried or simply lose interest and move on to the next candidate.\n‍\n‍\nDecluttering a resume can help you:\nImprove readability: A clean, well-organized resume is easier to read and allows hiring managers to quickly see your key qualifications.\nHighlight relevant details: By focusing on the most relevant skills and experiences, you make sure your resume showcases how you're the right fit for a job.\nMake a strong first impression: A minimalistic resume with room to breathe looks more professional and makes a positive visual impact.\nIncrease comprehension: Clear, concise content helps recruiters understand your value prop without having to sift through unnecessary details.\nResume cleanup is about more than just removing words or adding white space; it's about strategically presenting your strengths in a way that grabs attention.\n‍\n7 tips for decluttering a resume\nA clean, concise resume will help you make a strong first impression. Below are seven tips to declutter your resume to showcase your unique value.\n‍\nAnalyze your resume\nFirst, you want to check your resume score by uploading your current resume to Teal and navigating to Resume Analysis. This helps you uncover any glaring gaps or oversights in your content.\nResume Analysis scans for quality issues, giving you a breakdown, suggestions for improvement, and a score that changes in real-time as you make adjustments—ensuring your professional summary, bullets, and skills align with modern best practices.\nScan Your Resume\n‍\n\n‍\nOnce your Resume Score is at least 60%, it's time to spring-clean your content.\n‍\nTip 1: Trim excess details\nWhen it comes to resumes, brevity is key.\nOne of the biggest mistakes job seekers can make is trying to include every single detail of their work history, education, and skills.\n‍\nTo trim excess details:\nPrioritize: Focus on your most recent and relevant experience (focus on your last 10-15 years of experience), especially in the top third of your resume, where hiring managers look first\nUse bullet points: Break down your achievements and results into bullet points for easy reading\nLimit length: Your resume length should span one to three pages unless you're an executive or applying for a role that requires more in-depth information (like academia, law, or the medical field)\n‍\nNot every detail of your work history is equally important for each application.\nRelevant information means focusing on the skills, experiences, and bullets that are most applicable to a specific job you're applying for. Tailoring this information helps show prospective employers how you're an ideal fit for a position.\nIn Teal, just check (or uncheck) the boxes next to the most relevant details for each unique job. If you don't have a specific job in mind yet, check the boxes next to the details that best represent your most recent experience and core strengths.\n\nTip 3: Use resume bullet points wisely\nWhen it comes to presenting your work history, resume bullet points are your best friend. They make your resume more readable and help highlight your key accomplishments. Here's how to use them:\n‍\nFocus on impact and results\nEach job should have 3 to 5 bullet points that emphasize your bullet points with results rather than just listing responsibilities.\nFor example, instead of saying, \"Managed a team,\" try something like, \"Led a team of 10 to exceed quarterly sales targets by 20%.\"\n‍\nBe specific and quantify\nWhenever possible, quantify your bullet points. Numbers, metrics, and data grab attention and give a clear picture of your impact and results.\nFor instance, \"Developed and implemented new service protocols based on customer feedback and industry best practices, resulting in a 15% year-over-year increase in customer satisfaction.\"\n‍\nUse action verbs\nStart each bullet point with a strong resume action verb to convey a sense of movement and initiative. Words like \"achieved,\" \"improved,\" \"designed,\" and \"implemented\" are powerful and direct.\n‍\nTailor to the job\nCustomize your bullet points for each job application to highlight the skills and experiences most relevant to the position.\n‍\nKeep it concise\nAim for bullet points to be one to two lines long. Avoiding long-winded explanations can help shorten your resume, getting straight to the point.\n‍\nPro Tip: If you're stuck on how to talk about your proven track record, Teal’s customizable AI can guide you in writing better resume bullet points that stand out. Add a job description, specific keywords, or a prompt to generate tailored output.\nWrite Resume Bullet Points With AI\n‍\n‍\nTip 4: Align language with every job\nUsing clear and simple language on your resume ensures hiring managers can easily understand your qualifications. Avoid complex jargon and align your skills, qualifications, and language with the job description. This helps you present yourself as the perfect fit for the role.\nTeal’s Matching Mode can help you align your resume language to every job description. It gauges how closely your resume matches the job requirements, giving you a score and helping you improve that score with suggested hard skills, soft skills, and other important language without guesswork or filler. This results in a cleaner, more focused resume that highlights your most relevant qualifications and skills.\nMatch Your Resume to a Job\n‍\n‍\nTip 5: Focus on clean design\nWhile the appearance of your resume isn't as important as the content, it's no secret that resume design impacts readability.\nA well-designed resume ensures hiring managers can quickly find and understand your key qualifications.\nResume design tips:\nUse white space by breaking up text with more space to make your resume readable\nAssign headers to each section to help organize your content\nChoose a readable font that's professional and easy to read\nAvoid graphics or images on your resume so it’s clean and ATS-friendly\n‍\nWith Teal’s Design Mode, you can declutter your resume content quickly. Teal offers flexible, customizable resume formatting for a personalized, clear approach:\nTemplates: Choose from modern, traditional, or creative designs\nSections: Reorder and rename sections to fit your experience\nStyle: Select fonts, accent colors, and line height\nSettings: Format dates, locations, and experiences\n\n‍\nTip 6: Proofread and review\nProofreading is crucial for a polished resume. Here’s a quick checklist to ensure your resume is error-free:\nSpelling and Grammar: Double-check for typos and grammatical errors\nConsistency: Ensure consistent formatting, font, and style\nClarity: Verify that your points are clear and concise\nContact Information: Make sure your contact details (like your email and LinkedIn profile URL) are up-to-date and professional\nProfessional tone: Maintain a professional and polished tone throughout\nAccuracy: Cross-check dates, job titles, and bullet points for accuracy to avoid lying on your resume\nRelevance: Ensure all information is relevant to the job you're applying for\n‍\nTip 7: Regularly update\nTo avoid an outdated resume, tracking bullet points once per month and saving them in Teal can help keep your resume current and ready whenever you need it.\nRegular updates ensure your resume highlights your recent and relevant bullets, new skills, and updated career chronology. This proactive approach keeps you prepared for new opportunities without the stress of last-minute revisions.\nWith Teal, you don’t have to delete past experiences; you can store your entire career history for free and pick and choose what to include based on the job.\n‍\nDeclutter your resume with Teal\nEvery word on your resume should earn its valuable space. A cluttered, messy resume can hold you back from landing an interview because hiring professionals might not see your value at a glance.\nTeal's AI Resume Builder offers tools like Matching Mode, Resume Analysis, and Design Mode to help you quickly declutter and optimize every section of your resume for modern best practices and maximum impact.\nDon't let a cluttered resume hold you back from landing an interview.\nSign Up For Teal Today\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan a resume be too cluttered?\nIs a crowded resume bad?\nCan a resume be too cramped?","URL Slug":"declutter-resume-tips"}}]}

Yes, you heard that right—editing, not resume writing. \n\nWhy? Because crafting a professional resume doesn't stop at putting your qualifications and experiences on paper. That's just the start—the first draft. The real magic happens in the editing process. It's through meticulous editing that your resume transforms into a compelling narrative that grabs the attention of the hiring manager and gets you closer to your dream job. \n\nIn this blog post, you’ll learn seven essential resume editing tips that will help you avoid common mistakes and make your resume stand out in the crowded job market.\n\nDon’t rush it: Understanding the importance of resume editing\nIn your job search, your professional resume serves as your first impression. It’s submitted along with your job application and shares your skills, best qualities, achievements, work history, and professional experiences with a potential employer.\n\nWhile getting all of your content down on paper is the hardest part, you can’t overlook the importance of editing in creating a professional resume that helps you land job interviews and pursue your career goals. \n\nWhen you invest time and energy into resume editing—whether you rely on a resume writing service, use a resume builder, or go the DIY route—you:\n\nPresent yourself as a polished, professional, and detail-oriented job seeker\nShowcase your best qualities and key skills with quantifiable results and impacts\nCreate a tailored resume that matches the description for the specific role you’re applying for\nWrite about your experiences in a way that’s keyword optimized and improves your chances of getting through applicant tracking systems (ATS)\nImprove your chances of impressing hiring managers, landing job interviews, and potentially even getting hired faster\nRegardless of whether you’re dusting off an existing resume or starting from scratch, the resume editing process isn’t something to skip or speed through. Dedicate some time to carefully reviewing your document to make sure it showcases you to potential employers in the best light.\n\nTeal’s Resume Builder can help you draft your perfect resume. You can add achievement-based bullet points using helpful prompts, suggestions, and examples. Or, click the button to have AI generate bullets for you (and then adjust accordingly).\n\nAnd when it comes time to review your resume with a fine tooth comb, Teal’s Spell Checker makes it easy to spot and fix errors. Unlike other online resume builders, you can also use Teal’s Resume Checker to identify gaps and improvement areas. Doing so will streamline the resume editing process and help you create your very best resume. \n\nHow to edit a resume: Best practices\nYou’re ready to roll up your sleeves and put on your “resume editor” hat. So, how do you tackle this step—especially when you don’t consider yourself a professional resume writer? Before you get started, keep these best practices in mind: \n\nGive yourself plenty of time\nWhen you feel rushed, you’re bound to miss things or make mistakes. Dedicate plenty of time to reviewing your document.\n\nHow long you need to spend will depend on the length of your resume (an entry level resume is understandably shorter than an executive resume that lists a long employment history) and how much tailoring you need to do.\n\nBut in general, job seekers should plan to spend at least an hour proofreading and fine-tuning a resume—even longer if they’re reviewing their cover letters at the same time.  \n\nRead it backwards\nHere’s a helpful editing hack: Try reading your resume backwards (meaning, from the bottom to the top). Doing so forces your brain to focus on each sentence rather than skimming to the bottom. Reading backward makes you more likely to catch grammatical errors, patch up punctuation mistakes, remove unnecessary details that make it obvious you used a resume template, and spot any other missteps.\n\nReread in another font\nChanging your font style can also help as you edit. Not only does it make your document look fresher to your eyes (which is important when you’ve been staring at it for so long), but research shows that text style also impacts our cognitive processes which improves your chances of catching more mistakes. \n\nEnlist the help of a friend\nThere are plenty of professional resume writing services that can help you get this done. But, if you’re staying focused on free solutions, ask a trusted friend to take a look at your resume, provide some constructive feedback, and complete a thorough edit. \n\nDon’t know anybody you’d trust with this important task? Teal’s free Resume Builder can do the hard work for you and take you from first draft to final product with clarity and confidence. \n\nCommon resume mistakes to avoid\nBefore we delve even further into the heart of the resume editing process, let's shine a spotlight on some common resume blunders that can make hiring managers push your application aside. Avoiding these resume mistakes is the first step toward crafting an irresistible resume.\n\nIncluding a career objective\nBack in the day, it was common to begin a resume with a career objective. It might have sounded something like, \"Seeking a challenging role to utilize my skills by...\" \n\nBut today, it's seen as outdated and space-consuming. Instead, HR professionals prefer a resume headline or professional summary that focuses on your skills and achievements and shows them what you bring to the table rather than what you hope to gain. Make it about them, not you.\n\nLengthy and dense resumes\nThe quickest way to lose a hiring manager's attention is by presenting them with a text-heavy, multi-page document. Remember, recruiters often scan hundreds of resumes, so it's important to keep yours concise and to the point. Aim to keep your resume to one page when possible, and make sure every word counts.\n\nIncluding irrelevant information\nYour resume isn’t an autobiography, but a tailored document showcasing why you're the perfect fit for the specific role you're applying for. Including information that doesn't relate to the job at hand, such as hobbies or personal details, can distract the hiring manager from your pertinent skills and experiences.\n\nPoor formatting and design\nFinally, subpar formatting can be a real deal-breaker. Even with stellar qualifications, a resume that's cluttered and hard to read can land in the rejection pile. \n\nClarity and simplicity reign supreme when it comes to your resume format. The best resumes use a clean, professional font, ensure ample white space for maximum readability, and are structured so that key selling points and qualifications are easily noticeable.\n\n7 resume editing tips\nWith some careful editing, you can work your way toward a professionally written resume (or at least, one that seems like it was written by a professional). Here are seven must-know editing tips to create a way-better-than-good resume that helps you land a job interview and score your next job. \n\n1. Tailor your resume to the job description\nNo two jobs are the same, so your job applications shouldn’t be either. The more your resume speaks to the specific role and company you're applying for, the more you'll stand out. \n\nResearch the company, understand the role requirements, and mirror the language used in the description. Highlight the specific areas of your work experience, certifications, and relevant volunteer work that align closely with what the employer is seeking.\n\nTeal’s AI Resume Bullets feature will help you produce metric-driven bullet points to include with your work history, using keywords from your target job description. It’s a fast and simple way to get past an applicant tracking system and present yourself as an obvious fit. When you’re ready to see how your current resume stacks up against the job, use Matching Mode to run a comparison and see which edits you can make to better position yourself.\n\nSign Up, It's Free\nTo understand more about the different parts of a resume and how to tailor them, check out our comprehensive guide. \n\n2. Use action verbs and quantifiable achievements\nHere’s a philosophy that professional resume services rely on: Recruiters care less about what you did and more about why it mattered. \n\nOne of the key aspects to focus on while editing your resume is showcasing your achievements with bullet examples—especially those that align with the job role you're seeking. It's not just about stating what duties you performed in your previous roles, but about emphasizing the results you delivered and the impact you had.\n\nDid you boost sales by 20% or lead a team to successfully complete a critical project? Maybe you streamlined a process that led to a 10% reduction in operation time or costs. Ensure these accomplishments stand out on your resume. Quantifying these successes with specific numbers provides hiring managers with tangible evidence of your capabilities and the value you can bring to their organization.\n\nWhile those numbers do a lot of the talking themselves, start each of your work history bullet points with a powerful action verb. Mix them up so that each bullet starts with something different (you don’t want to say “managed” over and over again). \n\nIf you need help, Teal’s Resume Builder will weave metrics into your bullet points and suggest strong action verbs to increase your impact.\n\n3. Keep your resume concise and relevant\nRecruiters are busy people (sometimes reviewing dozens of resumes, cover letters, and LinkedIn profiles each day). Therefore, your resume should be as concise as possible while still conveying your relevant accomplishments. With Teal’s Analysis Mode, you can see how your resume compares to the posted job and make strategic improvements. \n\nA good resume makes every word count. Instead of listing every job you've ever had, focus on the most relevant ones. A well-structured, succinct resume can make a powerful impression.\n\n4. Use a professional format and layout\nResumes aren’t about style over substance (simpler is always better), but the visual appeal of your document matters. Even if you have a great resume with all the experience and skills an employer is looking for, inconsistent fonts, mismatched bullet points, or cluttered information can turn off recruiters. \n\nEnsure you use a simple, clean layout with consistent formatting throughout. Bullet points should align; dates should be in chronological order; and fonts should be easy to read. Teal’s resume templates are a great place to start when creating a professional resume. \n\nfree resume templates\nCheck out Teal's free resume templates to make resume editing easy\n5. Proofread and edit your resume\nNothing can tarnish a good first impression like spelling or grammatical mistakes—they suggest sloppiness and a lack of attention to detail. After you finish writing, proofread your resume thoroughly to check for typos.\n\nTeal’s Spelling and Grammar tool offers built-in guidance to ensure your resume and cover letter are polished up and error-free. \n\nBut you don’t have to just rely on spellcheck. Read it aloud, have someone else review it, or rely on some of the other editing tips shared earlier. A flawless resume proves you care about your work and showcases professionalism in your job search.\n\n6. Update your resume regularly\nCreating a professional resume isn’t a one-time task. While your career evolves, your resume should too.\n\nWith that in mind, make a habit of frequently revisiting your resume and making any necessary updates—whether it’s to add a new job, swap out your skills, or implement advice you got through career coaching. \n\nYour career can be unpredictable, and regularly updating your resume means you always have a polished resume to start with if and when your dream job presents itself. \n\n7. Seek professional help if needed\nFeel intimidated by the task of creating your own resume? You can try a free resume builder like Teal to craft a resume online that puts your best foot forward in your job search. You’ll find resume templates and plenty of other features that take the stress and confusion out of both writing and editing your resume. \n\nOr, you can enlist professional resume writing services or a resume writer to do the work for you. Be aware that opting for resume services doesn’t mean you’ll get to be completely hands-off, though. You’ll need to work closely with resume services to feed them information about your history and experience. \n\nPlus, a professionally written resume can be costly. Exactly how much you can expect to pay will depend on your experience level, but the typical range for entry-level services is between $150 and $450 and more than $750 for an executive resume writer (and you can likely only use these finished resumes once for whatever role it was tailored for).\n\nA free resume builder like Teal is far more cost-effective. Plus, it gets the job done just as well and with an equal amount of elbow grease from your end. If you’re willing to put in a little investment and want the best value, the premium package (Teal+) gets you even more helpful features like unlimited AI uses and email templates for a price that’s way more affordable than most resume writing services. \n\nHow to edit a resume in different formats\nWe’ve covered a lot, but now let’s talk briefly about the actual logistics of editing. How you go about making tweaks and updates will depend on your existing resume format. Here’s a look at three of the most common ones.\n\nHow to edit a resume in PDF\nPDFs are typically meant to be static and read-only files, which means they’re notoriously tough to edit. If your resume is in this file format, your best bet is to sign up for Adobe Acrobat (there’s a seven-day free trial, but after that you’ll have to pay) and edit within that program. There are other free solutions to edit a resume in PDF, but most of them are glitchy and clunky to use. \n\nHow to edit a resume in Word\nThings are a little more straightforward when editing your resume in Microsoft Word—provided you already have access to Word. If not, you’ll need to pay for the program or upload your Word document to a different word processor like Google Docs or Pages. However, that will likely introduce some wonky formatting adjustments and other headaches when transferring between programs. \n\nHow to edit a resume on LinkedIn\nIf you built your resume using LinkedIn’s Resume Builder, editing is pretty easy. Click the “more” icon to the right of the resume you want to change and then select “edit” to make your changes. \n\nBut while it’s straightforward, we wouldn’t recommend this route. Your LinkedIn profile isn’t tailored to a specific job, which means it lacks the information and impact you need to make your resume stand out. Plus, many users say the resume templates are lackluster and the experience is cumbersome. \n\nInstead of purchasing Word or Adobe or tearing your hair out while you edit in different formats, try Teal. You can import your LinkedIn profile or copy-and-paste your resume for easier saving, editing, and tailoring for each job.\n\nTake your resume to the next level with Teal\nYou can’t overstate the importance of a well-crafted and refined resume in your job hunt. And while that might make you tempted to enlist the help of a resume writing service, Teal is a far better and more cost-effective way to go.\n\nWhy pay hundreds for a single resume review that gives you a document that’s only suitable for one job when you can use Teal to create impressive, tailored resumes for all different types of positions (and for only $9 each month)?\n\nTeal is a no-brainer fit for your job search—and it’ll help you present yourself as a no-brainer fit for the job you want.

Like the stock market, job demand changes with the tide of the economy and perceived value. \nFor example, over the last two decades blogging and copywriting were highly in demand. Today, social media marketing and video skills have overtaken writing as the most in demand for marketing teams. As AI spreads across industries, prompt engineering and machine learning are emerging as high-demand skills.\n‍\n‍\nIn short, these skills are in demand because they aid companies in keeping up with efficiency standards or leading innovation. They often impact a company’s bottom line, as they’re related to either improvements to their product or popularizing their product in the market. \nThis article covers rising in-demand skills and how to feature them on your resume.\n‍\nWant to show the right skills on your resume? Build a free resume with Teal's guidance and skill matching today.\n‍\n7 top in-demand skills\nWhile soft skills have become increasingly important to companies, according to the 2024 State of the Workforce Skills Gap, technical skills will always be the foundation for every new job opening.\nIn truth, these in-demand skills usually are the job. For instance, one skill might be coding or cloud computing. If those are the skills requested in a job opening, that’s the basis for the work you’d do.\nOften, a combination of the right in-demand skills can earn you even more money. Teal's Skill Generator helps identify the key skills the company is after and its Skill Manager helps you group skills to use repeatedly on certain resumes for similar roles and easily show or hide skills from certain resumes.\n‍\n‍\nSo, if you’re looking below for high-paying skills to acquire to increase your income, you might consider it a new direction for your life altogether.\n‍\nAI skills in demand\nAI has permeated just about every industry, improving technologies that already exist, adding features to SaaS tools, and bringing entirely new tools and opportunities to the market. \nTake Teal’s AI Resume Builder as a prime example of this. It has the features you’d expect any resume builder to have (and then some)—like the ability to generate cover letters and reword your bullet points and responsibilities based on details from your work history and the job description.\n‍\nBut the addition of AI allows users to boost their bullet points by finding the perfect phrasing, adding assertive language, and highlighting numbers. \nA third of all SaaS companies are now marketing some AI features or capabilities. Because of that, the jobs with some level of AI in the description are growing. \nWith this surge, the ability to work with AI is one of the most high-income skills in the job market right now. \n‍\nJobs in AI\nCloud computing engineer\nData modeler\nMachine learning engineer\nAI engineering\nAI research assistant\nPrompt engineer\nAI consultant\nAnd so much more. Here are two AI hard skills, along with related jobs:\n‍\nIn-demand skill 1: Language Programmer\nMany people looking to get into coding think they need to excel in programming languages like Julia, Python, C++, and Javascript. \nBut most companies have established use cases for SQL (rather than Python) and use an SQL database to store their data. Being able to query the exact data you need is exceptionally handy, and makes language programming one of the most in-demand skills in today's job market.\nWeb development skills are also increasingly in demand, especially for those interested in creating and maintaining dynamic websites and applications.\n‍\nLanguage programmer jobs\nAI engineer\nMachine learning engineer\nAverage language programmer salary: Entry-level AI engineers make around $118,000 per year, while the average salary for an AI engineer is around $156,000 per year.\nMost lucrative industries for language programmers: According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the tech industry hires more AI engineers than any other sector, understandably. The finance and healthcare industries are close behind.\nDegree and skills required for language programming: Taking a look at several job descriptions for AI engineers, you’ll see a Bachelor’s degree is the most requested level of education (at minimum), with a wide array of tracks running from computer engineering to electrical engineering. \nMost of these job openings also require some experience in robots and autonomous systems. \n‍\nIn-demand skill 2: Data modeling and analytics\nAnalytics ranks in the top ten on LinkedIn's top skills list. Almost all analytical skills are the highest paying skills right now, and just about any job with “analyst” in the title will benefit from SQL and Excel expertise, just as with language programming.\n‍\nThough technical expertise and skills in data analysis are highly in demand, they’re also more prevalent than engineering. In other words, the market is flooded with job seekers looking to hold an analyst title. It’s a competitive industry, but according to LinkedIn, there are 180,000+ data modeling job postings on their site alone.\nMachine learning is also a critical component in data modeling, helping to automate and improve predictions and insights from data.\n‍\nData jobs\nData analyst\nData scientist\nData engineer\nData architect\nTechnical manager\nBusiness intelligence developer\nAverage data modeler salary: The average salary of a data modeler is around $105,000 per year, though this total may vary with bonuses or commissions (on average, $135,000 per year after bonuses). \nMost lucrative industries for data modelers: Healthcare and pharmaceuticals, finance, and retail tend to be the largest hirers of data modelers, with the financial industry paying the highest salaries among them. \nDegree and skills required for data modeling: You’ll likely need a bachelor’s degree in either data science, computer science, information science, mathematics, or another related field, according to various job listings. \n‍\n‍\nIT skills in demand\nIn-demand skill 3: Cybersecurity and cloud security\nAccording to the 2024 Pluralsights Tech Forecast, “cloud security is a persistent skills gap—and orgs will need cloud-specific policies, organization-wide security experience, and hands-on experience in Azure, GCP, and AWS to fill it.” \nOrganizations are working on staying lean, while still trying to build up their cloud architecture in the face of much more commonplace AI-generated cyberattacks. This makes anyone with skills in cybersecurity in demand in the current job market. \n‍\nCybersecurity and cloud jobs\nSecurity engineer\nRisk analyst\nSecurity architect\nCybersecurity consultant\nCloud network security engineer\nIT security analyst\nCloud compliance\nSecurity office\nSoftware architect\nAverage cybersecurity salary: The average salary for someone in cybersecurity is $121,000 per year to $222,000 per year. However, the variety of positions in cybersecurity and your location will have a large impact on your earning power.\nMost lucrative industries for cybersecurity: Financial institutions remain one of the largest targets for hackers and cyberattacks, naturally making them one of the largest talent seekers of cybersecurity professionals. \nA long-standing shortage of cybersecurity professionals has separated cybersecurity as one of few high-income skills if you’re looking for a profession with many opportunities. \nDegree and skills required for cybersecurity professionals: The minimum education for a cybersecurity job is a bachelor’s in cybersecurity. You should also develop skills in coding, risk management, policy configurations, firewalls, and computer forensics. \nSoft skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication are crucial to cybersecurity. \n‍\n‍\nIn-demand skill 4: Sales\nThe ability to sell will likely remain an important skill for the foreseeable future. Companies will always need to close deals and increase revenue. \nThere also tends to be a lack of job seekers in sales, particularly for sales leadership roles requiring management skills, making it a rewarding skill to develop if you’re interested in a high-paying career with low technical or computer skills. \nInterpersonal skills are particularly important in sales, as building and maintaining client relationships is key to success.\nSales jobs can vary wildly though. For instance, the industrial market doesn’t have “recurring” revenue, and focuses more on MRO (maintenance, repair, and overhaul). They won’t move you off accounts each year and request that you spend more time developing relationships. You might take trips to facilities each day or week to develop those relationships. \n‍\nSales jobs\nSales representatives\nSales manager\nSales director\nLicensed sales professional\nAverage salesperson salary: The average salary of a sales professional in the US is $81,000 per year. \nMost lucrative industries for salespeople: The tech industry remains one of the largest employers of sales professionals, as well as one of the highest-paying industries. \nDegree and skills required for salespeople: You don’t typically need to have a degree or certificate to get into a sales role. But you might need to be familiar with some of the sales tools many companies use, particularly their CRMs (customer relationship management systems). \nThat isn’t to say an education isn’t helpful in sales, or that you won’t need one in some industries. \nYou might have a degree in Horticulture and sell supplies for large landscaping companies. You could even have a background in cybersecurity and switch to sales, selling cybersecurity implementation on DoD construction projects to general contractors. \nThe benefit of a sales career is there’s generally a role for job seekers with people skills and any type of background. \n‍\nMarketing skills in demand\nMarketing is in a constant state of flux. But with generative AI, the removal of third-party cookies, growth gaining popularity of podcasting and video marketing, LinkedIn’s shift to a TikTok-like video platform, the change as of late has been dramatic and it seems companies are still adjusting.\nOne thing that has remained steady in the marketing world, though, is the need for content. While written content (such as articles) has long-held reign, the business growth across platforms like TikTok has led to a surge in demand for social media marketing and video development skills.\n‍\nIn-demand skill 5: Video editing\nThe U.S. Department of Labor and Statistics show there are around 28,000 video editors already employed across the United States. But this doesn’t account for self-employed video editors.\nWhile some companies do keep video editors on staff, the freelance market for video editors is large and thriving.\nThis is largely thanks to the rise of marketing teams using TikTok and YouTube, and now, as LinkedIn switches to a more TikTok-style format, this demand will only increase. \nDigital literacy is crucial for video editors, as they need to navigate various software tools and platforms efficiently.\n‍\nVideo editing jobs\nDirector of video production\nVideographer\nMultimedia production specialist\nVideo content creator\nFilm editor\nAverage video editor salary: The average salary for a video editor in the United States is $65,000, according to the Department of Labor and Statistics.\nMost lucrative industries for video editors: The film and television industries are one of the most prominent employers of video editors, but this is a drastically different brand of editing than you’d employ for an agency or company. \nMost video editors that work outside of film and television work as part of the marketing department. Even this work can vary wildly. You could work within healthcare systems, universities, nonprofit organizations, marketing agencies, or small to enterprise companies. \nDegree and skills required for video editors: Like sales, video editing positions don’t necessarily require a degree. They can be entirely self-taught, particularly if you start your career as a freelancer and work your way in-house from there. \nHowever, you may need experience using particular tools or software used within the company, such as this listing requiring experience with After Effects and Adobe Studio.\n‍\nIn-demand skill 6: social media\nSocial media managers are high in demand right now as more and more companies try to humanize their products and services by putting a face to their name. They often do this by adding policies that encourage their employees to build their own audiences on a social channel and by having the company’s CEO build their audience. \nSome companies (Wendy’s is a great example of this) use their brand mascot as a personality across social media. \nBehind every one of those accounts is a social media manager or content marketing manager. Even CEOs will often have a ghostwriter managing their account.\nWith the prevalence of social media today, community building is a necessary method of getting in front of customers, putting it alongside other high-income skills.\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) skills are also valuable for social media managers to ensure their content reaches a broader audience.\n‍\nSocial media jobs\nSocial media specialist\nSocial media strategist\nCommunity manager\nAverage social media specialist salary: The average salary for a social media specialist in the United States is $56,000 per year, according to ZipRecruiter. \nMost lucrative industries for social media specialists:  E-commerce and retail industries are the largest employers of social media specialists and also the largest spenders on social media advertising. SaaS, travel, and hospitality are also big employers in social media. \nDegree and skills required for social media specialists: While you can get a bachelors in marketing, communications, journalism, media, or other related arts track, it’s not always a requirement for a position in social media. It can be entirely self-taught, particularly if you’re freelancing. However, you will find that larger companies tend to request a bachelor's as a minimum level of education.\n\nTrade skills in demand\nThe labor market has been facing considerable declines in job seekers for decades but are now facing significant losses for companies, particularly in manufacturing and construction. \nAs a result, companies have increased salaries by nearly 20 percent, and competition for acquiring skilled candidates is at an all-time high. It’s likely this trend will continue. \nBecause of that, it’s a good time to develop trade skills. \n‍\nIn-demand skill 7: Construction \nAt the end of 2023, there were over 300,000 job openings in construction across the United States. The majority of companies with openings are having a hard time filling them. \nOf course, this is a wide field, and it’s not completely clear which skills are most vital within construction. However, there is a general need across the U.S. for welders, cutters, and solderers. Electricians and heavy equipment operators are also high on the list of needed skills. \nAdaptability skills are crucial in construction, as projects can change rapidly and workers need to adjust to new tasks and environments.\n‍\nConstruction jobs\nElectrician\nWelder\nSolderer\nHeavy equipment operator\nProject manager\nConstruction laborer\nAverage construction worker salary: The median salary for a construction laborer is around $40,000 per year. \nMost lucrative industries for construction workers: Construction is an industry all on its own, but real estate development looks to maintain its place as one of the most profitable niches.\nDegree and skills required for construction workers: If you’re looking to become a construction manager, executive, or architect, you’ll need, at minimum, a bachelor’s degree in construction management, civil engineering, or architecture. However, the education requirements for construction laborers are much lower.\nYou might have gone to a trade school for your high school diploma, and that can certainly qualify you for most laborer jobs. Most employers are more concerned with your experience in the field. \n‍\nTeal's AI features can help you highlight these in-demand skills. Simply scroll to the skills section, click “add skills,” and enter your skills individually, or add a comma between them to enter them in one pass.\n‍\n‍\nFuture-proof your career with in-demand skills\nWhile there is no way to predict which skills will remain in demand, certain skills are likely to remain important for the foreseeable future.\nFor instance, companies will always need to sell and market their products or services. While the particular high demand within marketing will always vary, it will still be a lucrative department in every industry. \nTechnical skills like analytics, coding, and cybersecurity are also likely to remain vital skills for the next few decades, particularly as AI progresses and industries adapt.\nIf you can combine in demand skills, it’s likely you’ll always have a job. Besides the ability to seek positions in multiple industries and for many job titles, you would also have the skill set to start your own business.\n‍\n\n‍\nWhichever skills you decide to develop, you need to feature those skills effectively on your resume.

Make a free resume with less hassle using Teal’s AI Resume Builder.\n‍\nTypes of resume writing services\nWhile the goal of professional resume writing services is to create a resume that’ll land you a job, each type of resume service goes about it differently.\n‍\nResume writing services from a company\nLarger companies that employ hundreds of freelance resume writers are a popular choice for many job seekers with a decent budget and a longer timeline with their applications.\n‍\nPros\nThe benefit of this type is the company is optionality. Some may even have in-house writers dedicated to your specific industry or role and can provide insights into previously successful resumes. \n‍\nCons\nSome resume writing services are large enough that they don’t dedicate one person or team to your account. Instead, you’ll have multiple people working on your resume, and the communication between them might not be stellar. They also might keyword stuff rather than weaving them in naturally.\nOne job seeker from Reddit shared their experience using a professional resume writing service: \n“I went with a resume writing service, and they clearly outsourced it to a country where English is not the most commonly spoken language. It was terrible and rife with errors. Luckily, I got my money back.”\nCreate Unlimited Resumes for Free\n‍\nSpecialized resume writing services\nThese are services dedicated either to your industry or career level, such as executive resume writing services, which often offer career training as well. \nThese services often have a directory of writers they vet and certify to write resumes for their specific industries, so you know you’re getting a professional. Typically, you’ll have a dedicated writer or team rather than subcontracted writers, editors, and reviewers.\n‍\nCons of specialized resume writing services\nWhile they’re more tailored and often include specific skills to help you land more interviews, they tend to be more costly. You might also have deal with delays in your ability to apply, as you go through a series of interviews with the service to ensure they’re truly capturing your work experience.\n‍\nResume writers\nYou can, of course, hire a professional resume writer that is unaffiliated with any company. These writers often work for themselves as a freelancer or small business, and have niched down into one particular area of resume writing.\n‍\nCons of working with a professional resume writer\nWhile they might have specialized industry knowledge, they're likely not familiar with the nuances of modern hiring tech or recruiting. They could just be a good writer that passed a training program to become certified in resume writing.\nTeal’s Director of Talent, Mike Peditto, echoes this with his statement:\n\"Some resume writers rely on a bit more of an outdated style that puts a large focus on visual appeal above the user experience of the reader. They often rely heavily on graphics, charts, tables or other design tactics that not only may get lost in an ATS, but also tend to focus on the items a recruiter doesn't need to see right away. This can be be more distracting than valuable to somebody quickly doing a pass through of the resume looking for key information.\"\n‍\nBuilding a resume with a resume builder\nA resume builder is a tool that allows you to create and customize your resume again to match the position you’re applying for. \n‍\n‍\nThis can be advantageous, since you understand your work history and industry better than anyone else. You also know which skills you want to highlight more depending on the role and how well you match it. \nAnother benefit is cost per resume. You can create as many resumes as you’d like, allowing you to tailor the resume to every single application. Whereas most services will provide you with one polished resume that isn’t tailored to a specific role, unless you’ve requested such. \n‍\nCons of using a resume builder\nIf your writing skills aren’t strong, you might not fully highlight your skills and experience without the help of AI features, not available in every resume builder. And while AI will assist in the writing, you will still want to personalize it. Teal gives you the best of both worlds with AI writing and ability to pull keywords from the job description, allowing you to better tailor each resume at scale.\n‍\n‍\nYou also might need to rely on templates to ensure you’re using the correct formatting to meet standards for an ATS.\n‍\n7 top resume writing services\nCalling anything “the best” is subjective to the criteria. Our criteria for determining the best writing services includes:\nSpeedy delivery\nGood pricing\nWriting skills commensurate with your level of education, expertise, and career\nNo recruiter or hiring manager is going to spend ages pouring over the details of your resume.

It’s an indicator of your people skills and how you make others feel. \nOf course, you’re human. You experience a range of outside emotions that you might occasionally expose to your colleagues. For better or worse, coworkers will respond to your social cues. It’s what they associate with you, and it rubs off on them, altering the entire vibe of the office.\nBut how can you gauge your level of people skills (or Trait Affective Presence)? How do you know what skills are most important in the workplace?\nIn this article, you’ll learn the most essential people skills and some tips on how to improve them. \nStruggling to land interviews with your resume? Get started with Teal’s AI Resume Builder for free.\n‍\nThe most essential people skills for any job\nAnyone who has ever relied on a network of colleagues and friends in their industry to get a job knows just how valuable people skills truly are. \nWhen people like you, they’re willing to put your name forward for roles even if they’ve never worked with you directly. After all, most jobs are looking for someone who doesn’t just fit a role but also fits a company culture. \nBut there’s more to it. People skills are sometimes integral to the job. \n‍\n1. Communication\nWhen you master communication, you’re able to comfortably speak in front of crowds and communicate effectively to earn buy in for your ideas. Both are keys to success in several professions. Just take it from Warren Buffet who, in an interview with Business Empires, said:\n “The best investment you can make is in yourself. Take communication skills— these students are getting their masters and they’re learning all of these complicated formulas. But if they just learn to communicate better, both in writing and in person, they increase their value 50 percent. You have to be able to communicate your ideas.”\nIf you’re a poor communicator, you might shy away from attention and avoid sharing your thoughts. This might lead to some difficulty getting buy-in for your ideas. \n‍\n2. Social skills\nSmall talk—or rather, being somewhat social—is an essential part of developing connections with people. But it can also be a vessel for developing effective relationships (or at least deeper conversations). Or, in the case of work, a vessel for opportunity.\nVanessa Van Edwards, author of the book Master the Secret Language of Charismatic Communication and Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People, shares the idea of “BIG talk”.\n“Big talk is the idea of leveling up boring, predictable small talk into deep, memorable conversations.”\nShe believes that interactions happen on three levels (the first five minutes, the first five hours, and the first five days). At the last level, the person or people you’re engaging with feel like a friend or a business partner. \n“Conversation is the key to moving up these levels,” says Vanessa. “Master conversationalists use conversation as a tool for everything from building rapport, socializing, and winning sales.”\n‍\n3. Social assertiveness\nTo conserve your social energy (and spend it where it counts), you have to have some measure of social assertiveness. That means you stand up for yourself in a social setting, and make your social needs known to others in a non-confrontational way. \nWithout social assertiveness, you might surround yourself with toxic people that don’t help you accelerate in life or your career. You might also put too much energy into pleasing your peers, and find it difficult to earn respect.\n‍\n4. Empathy\nPeople that are empathetic are exceptionally good at decoding the emotional state of others. This isn’t just emotional intelligence. It’s interpersonal intelligence. \nIt involves knowing yourself well and how to transfer your emotions onto others, in a positive way while also interpreting what others need.\nWithout empathy (or any interpersonal skills, for that matter) you'll have trouble decoding body language and picking up on social cues. \n‍\n5. Charisma\nWhile some people are born with natural charisma, this isn’t the only way to be charismatic. You can learn to be charming and charismatic.\nVanessa Van Edwards finds that charisma is a blend of two other personality traits—warmth and competence. \nCharismatic people are often associated with being warm, trustworthy, and approachable. But they’re also seen as dependable and capable.\nWhat’s interesting, Vanessa found, is that someone can be warm and approachable, but if they lack the other side of that (dependable and capable), they aren’t considered charismatic by their peers. \n‍\n6. Active listening skills\nDeveloping active listening skills can help you nurture relationships further, both in your personal life and at work. But it also has the impact of shaping your worldview, or helping you to shape the worldview of others. \nActive listening involves showing your interest in what someone is saying and allowing them to see you truly understand them. \nAccording to research from an article on conveying and detecting listening in the Journal of Experimental Psychology by Hanne Collins, Julia A. Minson, Ariella S. Kristal and Alison Wood Brooks, most people are rather good at faking attentiveness. \nThroughout their studies, they found that most speakers were unable to accurately interpret when people weren’t listening to them (their minds were wandering). Speakers even occasionally believed the listener to not be listening when they were. \nOf course, everyone has a different level of skill in both listening and interpreting body language. The only way to actively listen and to show you are, is to engage in the conversation by asking questions.\nImprove Your Resume with Keywords\n‍\n‍\nHow to improve your people skills\nBefore you can improve your skills, you need to know which ones are strong and which ones need work.\nTeal's Work Styles Assessment can give you a baseline understanding of your strengths, weaknesses, and work style.\n‍\n‍\nHow you communicate at work is a big part of the equation. Feeling unheard is a common experience for a lot of people. But this is particularly painful if you’re in the workplace, trying to convey any new idea, trying to sway clients or prospects, and most especially when you’re trying to manage people. \nJulian Treasure, the chair of the Sound Agency, which advises businesses on how to design sound in their communication and space, claims in his book, How To Be Heard, that there are seven deadly sins of communication.\n‍\nAvoid these seven communication mistakes\nThe seven communication mistakes—gossip, judging, negativity, complaining, excuses, lying, and dogmatism—make it hard to build trust and keep you from being heard when speaking among your peers. \n“It’s hard to listen to someone who’s constantly throwing their opinions at you regardless of facts,” says Treasure.\nHe goes on to explain that there is an opposite to those sins. They are the cornerstones of good communication—honesty, authenticity, integrity, and love. \n“It’s hard to judge someone that’s authentically wishing you well,” says Treasure. In order to improve the most important skill—communication—you must rid yourself of those poor habits and infuse your speech with those good cornerstones. \n‍\nImprove conflict resolution by being social and supportive\nShadé Zahrai, a science-based personal development coach, poses a situation that often comes up for her students in which a colleague excitedly explains their idea. You might respond that the idea didn’t work last time.\n“You’ve just unintentionally invalidated their idea, and them,” says Zahrai. Instead, she insists you change any “but” (as in “we tried that but it didn’t work last time”) to “and.”\nA phrase like, “Yes, and we can learn from what we did last time to increase our chances of success this time” is a much more positive and validating response.\n‍\nBe more charismatic\nMyka Meier, the Founder of Beaumont Etiquette, which teaches business etiquette and protocol, explains that, “one of the most important aspects to building charisma is having confidence. Make eye contact. Stand tall. Speak with conviction.”\nAnother tip Ms. Meier states for becoming more charismatic, is to be an active listener. You’re maintaining eye contact, nodding, and asking questions, especially questions that help the speaker tell their story, such as “what happened next?” or “what did you say to them?”\nKeeping a positive mindset is also instrumental to being perceived as charismatic. It passes off a certain energy that’s entirely infectious. \nFor more on developing people skills, check out this post on hard skills for your resume.\n‍\nJobs for people with strong people skills\nMaybe you feel you don’t have good people skills and are looking to understand which jobs value people skills, and which don't. Or maybe you possess a healthy dose of people skills and are looking for a job that keeps you social. Either way, here are a few examples of jobs that require fewer technical skills and more people skills:\nEvent planner\nSales associate\nMarketing manager\nFlight attendant\nPublic relations specialist\nTeacher\nHuman resources associate\nLife coach\nProduct manager\nAny front of house role in hospitality\nSocial worker\nRecruiter\nPerformer\nCustomer service agent\nOnboarding specialist\nCosmetologist\nNurse\nAthletic coach\nWhat many of these jobs have in common is they tend to involve a lot of noise and activity, involve a lot of collaboration with other team members (meaning a support system), and some level of risk-taking or experimentation.\n‍\nHow to include people skills on your resume\nIf you’re working on earning an interview, keep in mind that everyone you speak with in the company will offer some input as to your “fit” with the company. You’ll have to prove you demonstrate all of the good personality traits and characteristics they’re looking for in a new hire. \nTo land that interview, however, you’re going to have to add people skills to your resume. \nManage Resume Skills with Teal\n‍\n‍\nMost job listings will feature some soft skills that are particularly important for the role and to be a good fit for the company. \nTake a look at this listing for a Content Manager:\n‍\n“Strong communication and people management skills” are directly listed within this description. They double down after just a few bullet points by adding “exceptional written and oral communication skills.”\nCommunication skills are clearly an important aspect of the role. So you shouldn’t use poor communication skills to convey that. For example, avoid “I have demonstrated communications skills in this role,” or a similar iteration.\nInstead, there’s a specific way to add people skills to a resume. \nQuantify your experience: If the role is looking for someone that’s good with people (in other words, you can keep a level head and resolve conflicts easily) you might add a line under one of your past roles similar to, “led tour groups of 10 to 30 people for one hour tours.”\nPhrase your responsibilities in a way that demonstrates your people skills: Most roles are looking for someone who can speak well, either verbally or in writing. The responsibilities for some of your past roles should demonstrate this.\nPro tip: With Teal’s AI Bullets functionality, you can add in your work experience and choose to improve that summary with AI. The AI will boost your text with new arrangements, powerful language, and figures. You can then add in the appropriate numbers or make any changes you deem necessary for accuracy.\n‍\n\n‍\nUtilize the summary or professional statement: If you’re new to the job market and don't have extensive experience, you might include a professional summary to beef up your resume and highlight some of your personal skills.\n‍\nUse your bullet points: If you, for instance, took on a job that no one else wanted and had success with it, it might demonstrate your tenacity, drive, and proactive problem solving. If you lead a team through a difficult project, it could demonstrate your ability to collaborate and lead. \nUse your cover letter: Your resume might not always offer opportunities to highlight your abilities, but your cover letter offers more flexibility.

Too long? Too boring? Should I add pictures, colors, infographics, or a headshot? Does everyone else’s resume look better than mine?\nThere are many options for getting your resume reviewed, which is both relieving and overwhelming. Top resume review services provide resume editing tips to focus your attention. You can read about how a well-structured resume effectively shows off your best qualifications, but a personalized review from a knowledgeable expert will tell you how. In this comprehensive guide, I’ll share my experience from years in the resume writing world to help you find the right review option, for your resume and you.\nLooking for a resume writer? Use Teal to build a free resume yourself with AI guidance.\n‍\nWhat are resume review services?\nA review service offers feedback on your current resume’s format and content. The best ones offer personalized, actionable advice on achieving a polished resume for today’s competitive job market.\nAs artificial intelligence advances, some review services have started to incorporate AI. These give faster results, though sometimes less personal. Artificial intelligence may be more helpful in crafting your resume, enabling you to generate content with data gleaned from a data set. Additionally, many companies use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to screen resumes, so it's crucial to ensure your resume is keyword-optimized and ATS-ready to improve your chances of passing through the modern hiring world's screening process.\nTo understand how AI can help create, review, and optimize a resume, check out this post on the best AI resume builders.\n‍\nHow resume review services work\nOnline resume services prompt you to upload your resume, wait for feedback, and adjust your resume on your own. If you haven’t brushed off your resume in the past six months, it is time! Once your resume is up-to-date, pick the best resume review service for your budget, timeline, career goals, and personal preferences.\n‍\nPros of resume review\nThe biggest benefit to a resume review service is insight to improving your resume. Your resume will show how resumes should look and perform for today’s online job search. You’ll get advice that can guide a self-directed resume revamp. With helpful feedback, you can make an informed choice about improving your resume on your own or paying for help. Remember, it's crucial you're satisfied with the final resume. After all, it's a reflection of you. You can typically ask for revisions if needed.\n‍\nCons of resume reviews\nResume reviews require you to pay for each resume version you want reviewed. However, best practice is to tailor each resume to a specific job. So, you're still on your own for that tailoring process unless you use a resume builder that can provide keyword recommendations based on the job description, like Teal.\n‍\n‍\nWhile general resume feedback is still valuable, proceed with caution before signing up for every free resume review. Resume writing services often use free reviews to gather your information and upsell you on a pricier package.\n‍\nWhat makes the best resume review service?\nThe best software and service reviews are written by people who know the industry and have used the tools themselves. As a certified resume writer who has worked in the SaaS resume builder space, Caitlin Proctor met Teal's SaaS review criteria. Teal approached her to create this comprehensive review of the best options to receive a resume review.  Free versions of each of the tools listed have been tested by Caitlin. Here's what she had to say about her experience testing resume review services and tools:\nBecause “best” is subjective, I considered these factors for my list below:\nWho is reviewing your resume? What are their qualifications?\nHow long do you have to wait for results?\nHow much does it cost?\nDo people find the feedback valuable?\nWhat action do the reviews recommend?\nIn my experience, people are looking for useful information as soon as possible for as little money as possible. This article discusses online services that offer resume reviews, but there are two actions you should take before exploring these options:\nYour resume needs to be up-to-date with your most recent job experience. Your resume review won’t be accurate otherwise.\nConsult your personal and professional network for introductions to recruiters, hiring managers, or professional resume writers. This is your best option for valuable feedback, as a personal referral is most likely to spend more time reviewing your resume. Individual professionals can be hard to find, as they don’t have the advertising and marketing budgets that the best resume writing services do. Ask your network for resume review recommendations.\nFor a step-by-step guide on updating your resume yourself, check out our post on how to update your resume.\nNow that you better understand your options for improving your resume, here is my list of the best resume review options:\n‍\n6 best resume review services\n1. ZipJob‍\nZipJob offers a professional resume writing service which provides job seekers with a professionally written resume with tailored industry-specific content and expertise in hiring trends. To promote that service, they also offer a free resume review.\nAfter uploading my resume to ZipJob, the resume writing service company sent me a link to my resume review within 24 hours. My report from “Certified Resume Expert” Judy Klein at ZipJob included these sections:\nDesign, Structure, and Formatting\nLanguage and Writing\nResume Scanning Software Test\nRecommendation\nThe recommendation, as expected, was to buy a resume writing package from ZipJob to improve my resume. The other sections detailed how I could tackle updating my resume on my own. There were specific examples relevant to my resume submission, although the advice did not pull from my resume’s bullet points.\n‍\n‍\nZipJob free resume feedback benefits\nAdvice from a resume expert\nReport within 24 hours\nActionable tips with examples \n‍\nBest for\nEarly professionals\n‍\nPrice\nIncludes a free resume review. Paid resume writing packages start at $139.\n‍\n‍\n‍\nLadders is a job search engine geared toward executive-level candidates. Ladders offers various resume services, including an automated review in a matter of minutes.\nMy Ladders review provided resume feedback for two categories:\nContent\nStyle and Formatting\nThe report I received was fairly accurate, although it did flag “images and elements” as problematic when my submission did not include anything more complex than a bullet point.\nIt gave checkmarks to many elements of strong executive resumes, including length, professional headline, punctuation consistency, avoiding first person language, and using reverse-chronological resume order for my experience.\n‍‍\nLadders free resume feedback benefits\nResults within minutes, not hours\nHelpful information pre-written by resume professionals\nHighlighted the relevant section of my resume with the suggestion\n‍\nBest for\nExecutive resumes\n‍\nPrice\nIncludes a free resume review. The basic resume writing membership start at $149.\n‍\n‍\n3. Resumeble‍\nResumeble is a resume writing company with writers across more than 80 industries to review and rewrite resumes. They offer a free 48-hour resume review to help promote their resume writing services. The company employs professional writers to review and rewrite resumes, ensuring each document is tailored to the client's needs and optimized for keyword placement.\nMy free resumeble resume review report hit my inbox within one business day. The report included an overall score as well as scores for brevity, impact, and depth. There were notes on “industries that suit you best,” my file size, and my contact information pulled directly from my resume.\nThe analysis included these sections:\nVisual presentation\nOrganization and branding\nThe report suggested I simplify my writing, make my career summary more like a sales pitch, and avoid unused white spaces on my document. This is good, if generic, advice. Writing can always be simplified and summaries can always be more like a sales pitch. Joan, “Resume Analyst,” recommended I buy a professional resume rewrite\n‍\nResumeble free resume feedback  benefits\nFast results within 24 hours\nScored my resume\nGave actionable advice on editing a career summary\n‍\nBest for\nWriting advice\n‍\nPrice\nIncludes a free resume review. Paid resume writing packages start at $157.\n‍\nResumable review from other user\n‍\n4. TopResume\n‍\nTopResume offers a professional resume writing service, which can provide a professionally written resume with tailored industry-specific content and expertise in hiring trends. TopResume's resume analysis was similar to the other resume critiques above.\nThe review included these sections:\nWhat the tracking system thinks of your resume\nVisual presentation and organization\nResume writing\nDigital readiness\nRecommendation and next steps\nI got my TopResume review within 24 hours of uploading my resume. “TopResume Resume Expert” Deborah Campbell accurately described my resume as “not polished,” and suggested I cut down on my use of bullet points.\nThe review pulled examples from my resume to call out “doer” versus “achiever” language, which is common advice associated with reviews of the brand online. Interestingly, this was the only service that guessed I had zero years of experience from my resume detailing five years of experience. This is either a huge oversight or a glitch in the automated review process. Unsurprisingly, TopResume recommended buying a professionally written resume from its service.\n‍\nTopResume free resume feedback benefits\nUsing “achiever” language is good advice for resumes\nResponse within 24 hours \n‍\nBest for\nSecond opinions\n‍\nPrice\nIncludes a free resume review. Paid resume writing packages start at $149.\n‍\nTopResume review from other user\n\n‍\n5. ChatGPT for resume feedback\nI used the prompt: “You are an expert resume reviewer. You are familiar with the job of a professional writer and know what a resume needs to include to land a new job in the writing industry. Based on the resume below, what are three actionable tips for me to improve my resume to help me land more interviews?”\nI got a detailed response, but here are the three actionable tips:\nQuantify achievements with specific metrics\nTailor your skills Section to the job description\nEnhance the presentation of your work experience\nChatGPT can also provide insights into various resume services, highlighting the benefits of hiring professional resume services to ensure your resume stands out to recruiters and passes resume screening software.\nWhile true, my example resume did a good job quantifying the achievements. I did not provide a job description. As ChatGPT knows, my skills are tailored to a specific role already.\nThe third tip was both accurate and actionable; my resume was a plain text document with no more formatting than an essay. ChatGPT recommended adding an introductory statement, also known as a professional summary or resume summary, and adding key achievements. My resume submission did include these elements, so this advice was confusing. There were no tips on how to improve the layout of my resume.\n‍\nChatGPT benefits\nQuickest response time\nConversational with the option to ask for more details or clarification\nGenerally good advice\n‍\nBest for\nInstant feedback\n‍\nPrice\nIncludes a free plan. Paid subscriptions start at $20 per month.\n‍\n6. Reddit for resume feedback\nReddit is an online forum with subsections for various topics. The “r/resumes” subreddit has more than a million members.\nThere is a regular flow of people posting their resumes and people offering feedback. Reddit users can also provide feedback on various resume services. If you post your resume here, you can crowdsource your review for free, and you may get responses from people who have solved similar resume challenges or work in your field.\nHowever, you may also get no or low-quality responses and risk not knowing who is offering feedback, making it difficult to evaluate the usefulness. This option is less discrete than other options, as someone may be able to identify you from your information. If you go this route, I recommend posting a version of your resume that omits your identifying information.\n‍\nReddit resume feedback benefits\nAdvice from real people\nFeedback within minutes or hours\nAddresses specific concerns with your resume\n‍\nBest for\nFirst resume drafts\n‍\nPrice\nFree to join the community.\n‍\nr/Resumes review from other user\n‍\nIn my opinion, these options are all imperfect. You will have to compromise on time, budget, or the quality of the feedback. You will be marketed to, possibly relentlessly, whether or not your resume warrants that action. The advice might be irrelevant or too broad for you. You still have to learn how to incorporate it effectively.\n‍\nHow to use a resume builder to review and update your resume\nThere is an alternative to getting feedback and working with a resume writing service: choose from one of the best resume apps. AI resume builders have become a useful option for optimizing not only one resume, but dozens of resume versions to tailor to each job. Here's a breakdown of how I used Teal:\nUsing Teal’s AI Resume Builder, I was able to get a free analysis of my resume and much more. This tool combines real-time review with an AI Match Score to provide valuable insights into improving your resume.\n‍\n‍\nIt works by parsing your resume and instantly identifying if you have all the information you need on a resume. Additionally, it ensures your resume is keyword-optimized and ATS-ready, which is crucial for passing through applicant tracking systems used by employers to screen resumes.\nAs a reviewer and builder in one resume app, I could adjust my resume’s format quickly. Just by uploading my text document, the information looked ten times better on the screen. I already knew my resume’s format needed to change; this was the only option on my list that actually took that action for me.\n‍\nBefore Teal:\n‍\nAfter Teal:\n‍\nAfter uploading my resume, Teal’s AI Resume Builder analyzed my resume and suggested how to make it more appealing to hiring managers with a resume score.\nMy initial score was 71%. As I incorporated the first suggestion to add in a location, my score updated to 75%—instant gratification! While some review services offer a score, you often cannot update your resume directly within the platform to see if your score improves.\n‍‍\nAfter implementing the suggestions from the resume analysis, I used Teal’s matching mode to compare my resume to a job description. I could drop a link to a job posting and Teal immediately gave me a “Match Score” based on how closely my resume aligned with the job description.\nI got a low score, which makes sense as I compared my writer’s resume to a marketing manager job description. Teal provided a breakdown of which hard and soft skills were missing from my resume, that aligned most with the job description.\n‍\nHow does Teal’s resume builder compare?\nAs a standalone analysis, Teal’s resume checker is similar to the reports I got from ChatGPT, Ladders, ZipJob, and Resumeble. However, the ability to review and improve a resume simultaneously is a feature no other service offers. \nApart from Teal, ChatGPT was the only review that called out the need to tailor my resume to a job posting. However, Teal’s resume builder addresses that with their resume Matching Mode feature.\n‍\nChoose the right resume review service\nPicking the right service to review your resume is tricky, but knowing what each one offers can help you decide. Some services give quick but broad feedback, while others take more time but start updating your resume for you. Understand what you are looking for in a resume review service before buying.\nSome people want a quick confidence boost. Others are looking to update their outdated resume before starting a job search. Lastly, many job seekers need to tailor their resume to a few different jobs.\nTeal’s free resume review tool stands out because it uses AI to give real-time tips and helps you improve your resume right away. Having reviewed and written many resumes, I find Teal's tool very helpful. Ultimately, the best resume review service depends on your needs and budget.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIs paying for a resume review worth it?\nHow much does it cost to get your resume reviewed?\nCan I pay someone to review my resume?\nCan you get your resume reviewed for free?\nHow much do resume writing services cost?","URL Slug":"best-resume-review-services"}}]}

But now, you don’t just have to capture the attention of human recruiters. In many cases, you need to first make it past the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) screening software before your resume ever lands in front of a hiring manager.\n\nThat said, AI is always working on behalf of the company, looking for the keywords and experience the hiring manager dictates. In other words, the human is always driving the process, not \"robots.\" All the clues you need to advance are likely right there in the job description.\nAn estimated 70 percent of employers used AI as part of their hiring process in 2023, with the majority using AI to wade through resumes and job applications more efficiently. AI resume screening tools can quickly process the information included on resumes and surface the best-match candidates for a job opening.\nSound like a lot of pressure? It can be. Fortunately, this guide can help you figure out how to get your resume past AI and in front of the hiring manager.\nWant to build a resume that impresses AI screening tools and human recruiters? Use Teal's free AI Resume Builder to optimize your resume—the right way.\n‍\nUnderstanding the role of AI in recruitment\nFrom candidate sourcing to interview scheduling, small and big companies alike have found plenty of ways to use AI to improve the recruitment and application process. But it's also one of the most misunderstood tools.\n‍\nTeal's Director of Talent, Mike Peditto, reveals some eye-opening details about AI in recruitment:\nThere's generally a big misunderstanding of how recruiters and hiring teams are using AI, and the biggest is that, in most situations, AI is not the decision maker but rather a tool that can help hiring teams move faster.\n\nWhile AI can automate a lot of processes like scheduling and emailing candidates, the primary instance AI automatically rejects candidates is when there are set requirements needed in the job, such as a number of years, degree, or work authorization. These applications usually have questions known as 'knockout questions' that can trigger an automatic rejection.\n‍\nAnd when it comes to the misconception every ATS grades your resume with a specific score, Peditto shares:\nIn the select ATS systems where AI assigns a score to a resume based on certain skills—which is not the case for many—recruiters still need to go through and check the resumes to be sure candidates are qualified for the job. There's still a person involved.\n‍\nAI resume screening is one of the most popular uses of this technology in the hiring process. These automated systems quickly scan resumes for:\nRelevant skills\nYears of experience\nKey information\nImportant words or phrases predetermined by the employer\nSome resume screening or ATS algorithms then score and shortlist candidates who are the best match for the job duties and requirements included in the job description.\nPut simply, it’s a fast and easy way for companies to pull out the resumes that best match the job requirements. \n‍\nResume screening vs applicant tracking system\nIt’s easy to confuse applicant tracking systems (ATS) with resume screening tools—and the two do overlap. However, ATS software isn’t synonymous with resume screening.\nHere are the biggest differences:\n\nMost ATS include built-in resume screening functionality, along with other features for resume parsing, refining job postings, scheduling interviews, and more. ATS tools are broader and assist with overall recruitment management, while AI resume screening tools typically focus on automating and improving only the initial screening process.\n‍\nHow to get your resume past AI\nYou need to get your resume approved by AI before it lands on the desk or in the inbox of a human recruiter.\nPeditto has some guidance for making that happen:\nThe best advice for satisfying some type of AI screening is to meet the 'must have' qualifications for the job and be sure you show it on your resume. Of course, this isn't a guaranteed way to get an interview, but making sure you don't fail any knockout questions and including relevant keywords and necessary skills is crucial. \n\nEven in a world where AI is scoring your resume, if you're receiving a low score it's usually because you're missing the core skills needed for the job. Write your resumes to the job descriptions and the skills and keywords being asked for, not to try to trick a computer.\n‍\nSo, how do you follow the recommendations above to get your resume past the AI \"robots\" and one step closer to your dream job? Here are five strategies to help you out:\n‍\n1. Start with an ATS-friendly template\nYour resume isn’t the place to get creative with fancy templates or to show off your design skills. Resume screening tools need to be able to easily identify and process the information on your document, so simpler is always better than flashy when it comes to resume design.\nStarting with a resume template (Teal’s library has plenty of free and paid options—all of which are compatible with ATS and screening tools) will help you keep your resume easy to review.\nBrowse Free Resume Templates\n‍\n‍\nIf you do decide to start your resume from scratch, make sure to:\nPick standard fonts: Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, Georgia, and Cambria are all popular options. Pick one font and stick with it.\nChoose the right file type: Review the job post carefully for any directions or relevant information about how to submit your resume. If the employer lists a desired file type, honor that request. Don’t see instructions? Here’s how to figure out if you should submit a PDF or Word doc resume.\nUse white space: A cluttered resume will confuse both AI and human resume screeners.\n‍\n2. Use a clear format and structure\nRelated to the above, the overall format and structure of your information makes it easier for both AI screening tools and potential employers to decipher.\nAlgorithms need to be able to parse information from your resume, analyze it, and compare it to the job posting. Resume formatting issues make it tough for the tool to find and use the details it needs.\nIf your document does make it into the human hands of a hiring manager, they won’t spend long reviewing your resume. Estimates state they only look for seven to nine seconds before deciding how to move forward.\nThat means this isn’t the place for fancy formatting. Your document should be as well-organized and as easy to read (or skim) as possible by using:\nClear headers: Organize your resume content into distinct sections (for example, work history, key skills, education, etc.) and label each with an intuitive header in a bold font.\nBullet points: A giant wall of text is overwhelming. Use bullet points to list your skills and previous job duties so hiring managers can quickly find the information they need.\nStruggling to polish up your structure? In Teal’s AI Resume Builder, click over to the “Analysis” section to get expert recommendations—covering everything from your structure to your keyword usage—to help  make your resume even stronger.\n‍\n\n‍\n3. Find and use the right keywords\nYou’ve likely already heard about the importance of tailoring your resume for every job. The point of your resume is to show you’re an undeniable fit for an open position, but you can’t clearly connect those dots if you’re using the same resume across all job opportunities.\nTailoring your resume is the process of looking at specific job descriptions, identifying the most important information, and then naturally including that on your own resume.\nStart by taking a close look at the job posting and asking yourself questions like:\nHow many years of experience is the position asking for?\nIs the employer asking for specific education requirements? What are they?\nWhat technical skills are required for the position?\nWhat about soft skills? Are there certain personality traits the employer is looking for?\nAre there relevant keywords or terms that receive a lot of emphasis in the job posting?\nTake notes as you go through the job description with a fine-tooth comb. Then compare your list of qualifications with your own experience and draw those parallels by incorporating relevant information on your resume. \nThink it sounds like a lot of work to find and use the right keywords? It doesn’t have to be. In Teal’s AI Resume Builder, you can attach a job description to your resume and click over to the “Matching” section. There you’ll see your overall match score as well as suggested keywords to add to your resume. It helps you check the right boxes—without all of the legwork.\n‍\n\n‍\n4. Quantify your bullet points\nHere’s another common piece of advice that any career coach or resume writer will give you: quantify your bullets. Incorporate metrics and real-world proof wherever you can, especially with your work experience section and your professional summary. \nHonestly, it’s difficult to tell just how much importance screening tools place on quantified bullet points. However, taking the time to add digits and emphasize impact is helpful for several reasons:\nMetrics often naturally incorporate relevant keywords screening tools are programmed to look for\nMetrics make your resume clearer and more precise, improving the accuracy of AI screening tools\nMetrics can align your experience with any key performance indicators or desired outcomes listed in the job posting\nPlus, when your resume does make it past the resume screening robots and in front of the hiring manager, your quantified bullet points are much more likely to impress than vague claims and buzzwords.\nThis is another area where Teal’s AI Resume Builder can help. Within your work experience section, select “add a bullet” and then press the “write with AI” button. Teal will use the job title to automatically generate three metric-driven bullets you can edit and use. You can prompt AI to try again or add more filters and prompts to further refine your results. \n‍\n\n‍\n5. Embrace (rather than avoid) AI\nThere are plenty of fears about the role of AI—especially among job seekers who view it as yet another hurdle to overcome in the search for their dream job.\nBut in reality, AI can be a huge boost for candidates. With Teal’s AI Resume Builder, you can use tools like ChatGPT to write a resume or use AI job search apps like Teal to assist with every step of the process.\nCheck out the 6 best AI job search tools for more ideas on how to use AI to land a job.\n‍\n3 common mistakes to avoid when preparing your resume for AI\nNow that you know how to increase your resume’s chances of making it past AI, here are three common mistakes to avoid in the hiring process below.\nIncorporating images: Screening tools often struggle to scan graphics and heavily designed resume formats, and they can distract from your content anyway. Keep it simple and stick with a text-only file for your resume.\nUsing insufficient spacing: Both hiring managers and AI tools prefer resumes that are easy to read. A cluttered resume makes their job a lot harder. Stay focused on relevance and ensure you have plenty of white space for a document that’s more balanced than burdensome.\nOver-optimizing: There’s an art to optimizing resumes for ATS and screening software. You want to include enough keywords to demonstrate relevance without venturing into keyword-stuffing territory. If your resume reads like a long list of buzzwords or a carbon copy of the job posting, you need to focus more on your experience and less on jamming in relevant terms wherever you can. \nPro tip: Aim for a 70% Teal Match Score when optimizing a resume for a job description if your resume feels too keyword-heavy when fully optimized.\nCheck Your Resume Score\n‍\n‍\nBuild your most robot-friendly resume with Teal\nThe reality is that your resume will likely need to make it past artificial intelligence and an ATS before it has the opportunity to be read by a hiring manager.\nThat can be intimidating for job seekers, but it can also be an opportunity to rethink the way you approach your resume. Teal’s Resume Builder can help by:\nProviding ATS-friendly resume templates\nComparing your resume to the job description\nSuggesting must-have keywords and skills to include\nAnalysing your resume and offering expert-backed recommendations\nGenerating impressive, metric-driven bullets\nGet started with Teal for free to create a resume that’s equally impressive to AI and real recruiters."}}]}

Here’s What’s Necessary & What’s Optional (+Resume Examples) and gain insights from real examples.","URL Slug":"what-to-include-in-a-resume?-here’s-what’s-necessa","Content":"What to Include in a Resume? Here’s What’s Necessary & What’s Optional (+Resume Examples)\n\nWhat to include in a resume? It’s tempting to think that packing in every detail will impress the hiring manager, but an overloaded resume can backfire, making it harder for your key qualifications to stand out.\nOn the other hand, if you’re just starting out and don’t have much experience, you might find it challenging to fill your resume and decide what’s worth including.\nThe good news is that every resume, regardless of your industry or experience level, should contain 5 essential sections that no resume is complete without (though not necessarily in this order):\nPersonal information\nResume summary or resume objective\nWork experience\nEducation\nSkills\nAdditionally, there are multiple optional sections you can include if they’re relevant to the job you’re applying for.\nTo help you craft the perfect resume, we’ll not only break down what to include in each section, but also provide examples for illustration. \nPlus, we’ve included a guide on what to include in a high school resume if you’re just starting out.\nWhat's necessary?\nResumes can look different depending on who's writing them. \nFor example, a student’s resume is going to look a bit different from someone applying for a senior role with years of experience. \nSimilarly, a social media manager’s resume won’t be the same as that of a front-end developer.\nHowever, no matter your background or the job you’re applying for, there are a few essential rules to follow if you want a strong resume.\nIf you’re unsure what a strong resume should include, a great starting point is to focus on these five key sections which every resume has to include:\nPersonal information\nResume summary or resume objective\nWork experience\nEducation\nSkills\nThese sections (though not necessarily in this order) should be included in every resume, regardless of your field or level of experience.\nNow, let’s take a closer look at each of these key sections.\n#1 Personal information section\nPersonal information section (also known as a resume header) should be at the top of your resume, as it introduces you to hiring managers with your essential contact details, like your name and email address. It's the first thing employers will look for.\nWhat's included in the personal information section?\nFull name. Use your professional name.\nPhone number. Use the correct country prefix code. \nEmail Address. Use a professional email address. Don't fill in your teenage and gaming emails. Also, don't use your email address from you previous job, it's not giving the best impression. \nLinkedIn Profile. Yes, you have to have LinkedIn at this point. Plus, they're going to look it up anyway.\nThere are also optional personal information you can include such as: \nPortfolio/Website. If it's relevant to your field (for instance in a creative industry), this will definitely help and usually, you will be asked to show one anyway. \nSocial media. If your role involves online presence, like marketing or social media management, include relevant profiles (e.g., Instagram, X). Tech roles might benefit from adding GitHub to showcase projects.\nPicture. Though not necessary, a resume picture is customary in some countries.\n#2 Professional summary or objective \nFirst of all, a resume summary and resume objective are two different things. \nBut they do have something in common: \nBoth sit at the top of your resume and are a few sentences (3-4) long \nBoth serve as a short teaser for the rest of your resume\nWhat's the difference between a resume summary and a resume objective? \nResume summary. It's looking at the past–focuses on highlighting your experience, skills, and achievements. It’s tailored to the job you’re applying for and shows how your background makes you a strong candidate. This summary is often used by experienced candidates and professionals to show their qualifications and the value they bring to the role.\nResume objective. It's looking at the future–focuses on your career goals and what you aim to achieve in the position you’re applying for. The purpose is to explain your career intentions and how this job aligns with your goals. Since it’s more forward-looking than a summary, it’s a good choice for first-time job seekers, career changers, and students.\nLet's look at 2 examples–of a resume summary and objective, which will clear any confusion you might have left:\nResume summary example\nDigital Marketing Manager with 5+ years of experience driving 20% annual growth through targeted campaigns and SEO. Skilled in team leadership and budget management, ready to bring proven strategies to the Marketing Lead role at XYZ Company.\nResume objective example\nRecent Marketing graduate with hands-on experience in social media campaigns. Seeking to apply my skills and creativity as a Social Media Coordinator at ABC Agency to help boost brand visibility.\n\n#3 Work experience\nWork experience is definitely the most important part of your resume and usually the first thing recruiters check to see if you’re the right person for the job.\nThis section is where you highlight your past roles, responsibilities, the projects you worked on, and any achievements you accomplished along the way.\nWhat to include in the work experience section? \nCompany name\nWhere it's located (city and country is enough)\nJob title\nDates of employment\n\nAnd, it doesn't stop there. You also want to include in each entry: \nMain tasks/what your focus was (1 bullet point). Start each bullet point with a strong action word, and use numbers whenever you can to show your impact. For example: “Managed a team of 8 marketing professionals, overseeing all campaign development and execution.”\nShow your accomplishments (2-3 bullet points). Quantify your results! For example, you could say, “Launched a social media campaign that grew the company's following by 30% in six months.”\nShow your problem-solving skills. If you lack concrete achievements, explain how you’ve solved a specific problem in the past with an example.\nTailor this section to the job description. Do this by searching for any recurring keywords, skills, or experience mentioned in the job listing, and then explain how you’ve demonstrated that skill in your previous jobs.\n#4 Education \nThe importance of the education section can vary depending on your level of experience and where you are in your career. \nRegardless of your experience level, it's important to include this section in every resume, even if it's brief. It provides essential context and credentials that employers look for.\nWhat to include in the education section? \nName and location of your university\nName of your degree or field of study\nThe year when you started and graduated\nIf you're a recent graduate this section is likely going to be the core of your resume. In that case, don't forget to include also: \nRelevant coursework\nGPA (if higher than 3.5)\nAwards (Dean’s list, magna cum laude, subject-based awards)\nScholarships\nRelevant student societies (especially if you were in the committee and played an active role)\nAcademic publications\nStudying abroad\nInternships \nThesis name and description\nAs with the work experience section, be specific, and focus on your highlights and moments where you learned the most. \n#5 Skills\nEvery.resume.needs.a.skills.section! \nOf course, your skills need to be sprinkled throughout your whole resume, but here you can highlight specific skills like using certain programs, certifications, or any technical training you’ve had.\nWhat to include in skills section? \nHard skills. These are the technical abilities you were taught. For example, programming languages or WordPress.\nSoft skills. These have to do with your personality. For example, collaboration, time-management, or dependability.\nAlternatively, pick relevant skills and divide them into several subsections like computer skills, marketing skills, languages, and others.\nLastly, the number of skills you should list is between 5-15.\n\nWhat's optional?\nWe covered the 5 key sections that shouldn't be missing in your resume. But, if you feel like you have something more to offer and it's relevant to your work, there are multiple optional sections that you can include in your resume.\nIn the list below you'll find what optional sections there are and what their point is in a resume. \nAlso, if you click on each respective headline, you'll find a more detailed guide on what to include in each of these.\nOptional sections for your resume: \nAwards and achievements. Your achievements should be scattered throughout your entire resume. But, if you have enough content for this section, it will definitely help you to stand out.\nProjects. You can even create a separate projects section to list all kinds of (relevant) projects you've worked on. These can be academic, personal, work-related, freelance projects, etc.\nCertifications and courses. If it's relevant to your job then it can give you a big advantage because you are already certified for certain activities.\nVolunteer work. Including volunteering on your resume can help you stand out. It gives insight into your character and shows that you’re willing to go the extra mile. If you’re short on work experience, the volunteering section can be an excellent way to demonstrate your skills and experience.\nLanguage skills. You can include languages as a part of your hard skills. If you have extensive knowledge in other languages and it might help you stand out, you can create a specific section dedicated to languages.\nReferences. The references section on your resume contains a list of people who can vouch for you and provide your future employer with more information about your abilities.\nPublications. If you work in an academic field, publications and patents are a great achievement. Adding a list of publications can be a good step in elevating your resume.\nHobbies. Our advice? Only include it if you have absolutely nothing else to put in your resume. In a more relaxed company, it might actually start a nice conversation later on.\nWhat to include in a high school resume?\nIf you're a high school student or recent graduate trying to get into the job market but don't have much experience and aren’t sure what to include in your high school resume, don’t worry. \nWith a few easy adjustments, you can have a solid resume even if you're a first-time job seeker.\nHere are some tips for creating a high school resume:\nUse a functional resume format. A functional resume (also referred to as skills-based resume) emphasizes your skills and abilities instead of your work history, which makes it a great option for high school students or first time-job seekers.\nUse a resume objective instead of a resume summary. Using a resume objective focuses on your goals and aspirations rather than on your work achievements.\nPut education section above experience. If you're a high school student, your education is the most important part of your life right now, so it should be the main focus of your resume. Take your time to put this section together carefully.\nDo include all of your skills. Include all the hard/computer skills you were taught in school. Also highlight any transferable skills you gained in your part-time jobs or while volunteering.\nShowcase other activities. Volunteering, clubs, and any other extracurricular activities can show your commitment and interests. It can be a great help with your first resume. \nWork experience (optional). If you have previous work experience, be sure to include it. However, if this is your first time seeking a job, focus more on your skills and education. With time, you'll gain experience to fill out this section.\nHere's how a high school resume can look like (click directly on the resume to vie the full-length resume):\nHigh school resume example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\n\nAnd if you want a little extra help, this is how you make a resume for your first job in 6 steps. \nWhat to include in a resume? (Resume examples)\nWe covered all the sections and steps to help you create a strong resume, whether you are a professional with years of experience or a high school student. \nNow, let's take a look at some resume examples. (Because you know... some people are simply more visual learners.)\nFYI, these resumes were made using Kickresume’s templates. They belong to real people, which also means they were anonymised. Some of these are more than one page long, so click directly on the resume to vie the full-length resume.\nMarketing and Brand Manager Resume Example\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\nGoogle Server Manufacturing Supervisor Resume Sample\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\nAmazon Software Development Engineer Resume Sample\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\nWhat NOT to include in a resume\nWhen writing a resume you have to make sure the information you're using is relevant and to the point. An unclear and messy resume can cost you a job.\nHere are some things you definitely shouldn't include in your resume: \nOverly creative formatting. Your resume should be easy to navigate and read. The more complicated it is, the more likely a recruiter will move on to another resume.\nUnnecessary personal details. You want to avoid stating any unnecessary details like your age, marital status, full  address, or religion. This information is not related to your job, so it's better if you keep it out.\nOutdated or irrelevant job experience. It can make your resume seem cluttered or give the impression that your career has stagnated. If you're not sure how many jobs to include, check out our article on how far back should a resume go.\nSalary information. This information can potentially exclude you from further interview process. This is something you should keep for the interview itself. \nNegative language or reasons for leaving jobs. This is a major red flag. Negative language on behalf of your former job makes you look unprofessional and leave an impression you are problematic. \nTypos and grammatical errors. Make sure your resume doesn't have any typos or grammatical errors, it gives an impression that you don't care and are imprecise. \nKey takeaways: What to include in a resume?\nSo, what should you include in a resume? Let's sum everything up. All resumes, regardless of your industry or level of experience, should include 5 key resume sections:\nPersonal information\nResume summary or objective\nWork experience\nEducation\nSkills\nYou can also include optional resume sections that will help your resume stand out, but only in case the sections you pick are relevant for the job:\nCertifications and licenses.\nProjects. \nVolunteer work.\nAwards and achievements.\nLanguage skills.\nPublications.\nReferences.\nSocial media.\nHobbies.\nWith that, you should be able to organize and build your resume in a way that will maximize your chances of landing a job. No matter how much experience you have. \nMake sure to avoid any errors, negative language or unnecessary personal information and you should be good to go. \nBut, if you feel like you still need some help, you can create your resume using our resume builder tool."}}]}

They're full of colors, icons and other visual elements.\nAfter all, visually appealing career documents have a specific purpose — to make hiring managers pay closer attention to your resume. They can also help you stand out from the crowd of the 1,000 people that applied for the job.\nOn the other hand, a 2016 survey of more than 400 employers showed that 78 % of them prefer traditional resume designs to something fancier like infographics, online profiles or videos. In other words, this survey tells us to stick with basic colors, commonly used fonts and standard layouts.\nOf course, a super-creative resume may not necessarily get you hired. Every job calls for a different kind of a resume and you should be able to tell when to use which.\nIt all depends on the type of job you're applying to, company values, and work environment. It also depends on many other things. We're going to discuss all of them below.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nThe traditional resume design is not dead\nWhen to use a creative resume design\nMake your creativity count\nThe traditional resume design is not dead\nIf you're applying for a relatively formal profession, you probably won't benefit from using a creative resume design. It would feel out of place, even somewhat inappropriate.\nThis mostly applies to typically non-creative fields like finance, consulting, law, academia, healthcare and government. Employers in these industries usually ask for neat resumes that look professional above else.\nSure, traditional resume designs don't look as interesting as modern ones but have their advantages.\nIt's not only a piece of paper.\nShow your personality with a standout resume.\nCreate resume\nFirst, standard formatting allows you to maintain high readability. It helps you demonstrate your achievements and experience very effectively.\nWhat’s more, a recent eye-tracking study on resume readability showed that additional graphic elements thwart recruiters’ analytical and decision-making capability.\nThe visual mess also makes it harder for them to locate the most relevant information like skills and experience. On the other hand, a conservative layout doesn't distract hiring managers from the content and also helps applicant tracking systems process your resume with ease. \nBut in the end it's like with all things: balance is key.\nIf you you overdo it with fancy visuals, you can easily drown key facts in the background noise. At the same time, if your resume is conservative to the point of being dull, no hiring manager is going to pay much attention to it.\n\nWhen to use a creative resume design\nCertain professions are obvious contenders for creative resumes. And if the industry calls for it, why not take advantage and make a solid first impression?\nCompanies that welcome creativity are usually much more open to customized job applications. If you're hoping to score for a position in fashion, marketing, design or arts, you can give it a try.\nNonetheless, you need to be careful. Don't go overboard.\nOrigami. Poster. Comic book. An extended business card.\nUsing an unusual resume design is a great way to stand out from the crowd, especially when you’re aiming for a position that values creativity or interactive skills. \nMore specifically, online portfolios and interactive resumes are useful for applicants who aim to include their own movies, songs or photographs for their self-presentation. Alternatively, a QR code generator can be quite handy to seamlessly connect a paper resume to your online portfolio or interactive resume. \nNo wonder that unique resume formats can often go a long way in distinguishing yourself from other candidates.\nBut remember that even a creative resume needs to stay a bit down earth — you still need follow several basic resume-writing rules.\n\n1. Keep formatting simple\nThere's nothing worse than going crazy with way too many graphs, shapes, background colors, outlandish fonts, weird alignment or irregular spacing. If you don't know what we're talking about, just check out the worst resumes floating around the internet.\nAbove all, make the important information easy to find, easy to read and easy to understand. The first one concerns your resume layout. The second one relates to your font choice. And the last one reminds you to mind your word choice and stylistics, too.\nLastly, don't forget to proofread your resume several times before sending it off. However creative it may be, a handful of mistakes or typos can easily ruin your job prospects and send your resume straight to the trash.\n2. One resume — one color\nChoose one color that you'll use throughout your resume. Use it for your section separation lines, bullet points or your position titles.\nThe key here is to use the color to draw the reader's attention to important parts of the text rather than distract them from the content itself. Here's an example of a well-designed resume that uses color with great style and taste.\n\n3. Don't lose your keywords\nBe sure to use relevant keywords throughout your resume regardless of its style. Take the most important ones from the job description and put them near the top.\nAlso, try to make the keywords easy to find by both a human being and an applicant tracking system. It's not uncommon for overly flashy resumes to be disregarded before any humans even lay eyes on them. Avoid embedding them in overly complex charts or graphs.\nOn the other hand, you can always submit your conventional resume along with your creative resume, especially if you're applying online.\nMake your creativity count\nMost recruiters spend mere 6 seconds scanning a resume. So whichever resume style you're going to choose, be sure to stay clear and concise.\nTo have a better idea, here's a selection of 10 best resume templates to use — universal, creative and minimalistic.\nIn some cases, using a creative resume design can be a good idea. When the industry or your work experience asks for it, feel free to unleash your inner genius. But if you take it too far, act like an exhibitionist or do something bizarre just to draw attention to your resume, you'll never going to score a decent job.\nNaturally, striking that fine balance may not always be easy. Your common sense should tell you what's appropriate. And if still in doubt, remember to choose the safe option. There's no shame in using the good old traditional resume design.\nApples or oranges?\nWhether you choose basic or creative, you will always stand out.\nCreate resume\nWhether you're inclined towards a minimalistic or creative approach, remember, you can effortlessly transform your LinkedIn profile into a remarkable resume with our seamless tool.","URL Slug":"minimalistic-vs-creative-resume-design:-which-one-","Meta Description":"Learn how to Minimalistic vs Creative Resume Design: Which One to Use? and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

Depending on your industry, learning how to make a good video resume might be the way. \nThat’s because a video resume or video CV can allow you to highlight sought-after personality traits, such as charisma, humor, and confidence, which don’t often come across in a traditional resume. \nIf you have such traits and want to learn how to make a video resume, then this article is perfect for you.\nStart with an engaging video introduction, get inspired from video ideas and create a job landing video profile!\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nWhat is a video resume and when to use one\nHow to make a good video resume\nWhat should I say in a video resume?\nGreat video resume examples\nMore video resume tips\nBest video resume websites, editors and apps\nTikTok resume\nWhat is a video resume and when to use one\nVideo resumes are more akin to a cover letter than a resume and should really be called video cover letters.\nThey are mostly used by those in creative professions, as it's a perfect way to demonstrate talents that would otherwise be hidden on a traditional resume.\n\nIf your field of work requires strong communication skills, then a video resume might be a great way to showcase them. However, it’s important that you read the room properly and that you’re sure that a video CV is actually appropriate for the occasion. \nAs a video CV is normally kept short and it's an entirely different medium, there are a few video resume pros and cons, such as: \nPros\nSoft skills such as communication skills are put on display.\nHard skills such as video editing are also showcased.\nUniqueness can give you an edge against an equally qualified\nShows dedication\nCons:\nNot able to cram as much information\nCan be informal\nCan open you up to discrimination\nHides your grammar skills\nRelated: Recruiter Reveals: Video Resumes, Pros and Cons & How to Make One\nHow to make a good video resume\nLet’s get the big red elephant out of the room first — a badly done video resume will kill your chances of getting hired. \nIf you’re to create a half-baked video resume, then stop here and just submit a regular resume. It’s often the best option anyways. \nHowever, if you think your qualities will shine through in a video and are applying to an industry where a video CV can work, such as the entertainment, marketing, and design industries. Then let’s continue. \nJust follow these 6 steps when creating your video resume:\n1. Test your equipment\nA clear picture and excellent quality audio is a must if you want to create a professional looking video.\n2. Create a script\nThe last thing you want to be asking yourself while filming your video CV is, “what should I say in a video resume?”. Plan before you begin recording, create a script, but use it more as a guide and avoid reading it word by word. \nAs to what you should say in a video resume, it will depend on your industry. However, try to highlight personality traits which are otherwise hard to showcase on a traditional resume.\n3. Dress appropriately\nAlthough you want to show off your personality, try to keep your attire on the formal side. Treat it similar to a virtual job interview. No pajamas or stained/wrinkled clothing, etc. \n4. Don’t recite your resume\nA video resume is its own kinda beast. If you have nothing extra to show on one, then just send in your resume and call it good. Simply reciting your resume verbatim is likely to be a detriment to you instead of a plus. \n5. Rewatch your video\nIt’s important that you don’t have any inconsistencies when submitting your video resume. Also, it’s easy to miss our own mistakes, if you can share it with a friend or family member. Even better, if you have a job mentor to share it with. \n6. Edit your video\nYou want to make sure you cut any distracting noises or empty moments from your video. Now, how long is a video CV? Try to keep it between 90 seconds in length. There are many tutorials online that can help you make a professional-looking video edit.\n\nWhat should I say in a video resume?\nNow that you know the practicalities on how to make a video resume, it's time to move on to the most important question, “What should I say in a video resume?”. \nApart from highlighting your personality traits, it’s important to have a clear message in mind when creating a video CV.\nKnowing what you need to say is more akin to knowing what they need to hear. This is the key to creating a sound video resume script and an overall great video resume. \nYou can do so by dividing your video into these 5 parts:\nSelf-introduction: Your name, the position you're applying for and experience level. Something as simple as, “Hello, my name is Matt and I'm a graphic designer with 7 years of experience in the travel industry\" should be enough. \nSay why you're applying for the position: Tell them why you're interested in the role you're applying for and show your passion for the job. Make it specific, not generic.\nInclude key accomplishments: Give a quick summary of relevant accomplishments throughout your career. Keep it brief (1-2 achievements) and make sure to quantify your accomplishments.\nAdd recommendations (optional). If you have good feedback from previous employers or clients, use a snippet as proof of the expertise and accomplishments you just mentioned.\nClosing: Re-iterate why you're interested on the position and re-share your contact information. Try adding this information on the screen, as it can be easily removed when uploading it publicly\". \nIn the end, your script should look something along these lines: \nVideo resume script example\nVideo resume script\nHello, my name is [your name] and i’m a [job title] with [X] years of experience in the [job industry].\nI’m applying for the [job position] role at [company name] because I believe my core values and skills align perfectly with what [company name] is searching for.\nI’ve had a passion for [your career field] for as long as I can remember and have pursued this passion by volunteering at [name of organizations], getting a degree in [career role], [list certifications], as well as many personal projects, such as [list related personal projects].\nAlso, apart from meeting the requirements for the position, I can also bring other skills that are sure to benefit [company name] bottom line.\nFor example, [list of relevant quantified results and accomplishments throughout your career].\nHonestly, as you can see from the video I get excited from just talking about the possibilities of working for [company name]. It has always been a dream of mine.\nThank you so much for your time, and am looking forward to hearing from you.\nGreat video resume examples\nOf course, a script is not enough when we're talking about video resumes.\nHere are 5 great examples that will fuel your inspiration:\n1. Visual designer video resume example\n2. Internship video resume example \n3.  Student video resume example \n4. Mass communication video resume example \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvroIaj2yIY\n5.  Film maker video resume example\nAs you can see from these examples, some careers are a better fit for a video CV. However, regardless of your career, so long as you have qualities that shine through on a video, you should be good to go. \nMore video resume tips\nOne thing to note is that even if you decide to create a video CV, it's important that you always accompany a video resume with a traditional resume. \nOther video resume tips to keep in mind are:\nUse a video resume maker: Seriously, unless you’re a designer, using a tool specifically made for video resume is the way to go. The last thing you want to do is show your potential employer your bad editing skills. \nTalk clearly and slowly: Yes, you'll have less to say because of this. You just have to make sure you only add the best bits of information. \nUnderstand company culture: This is important because the overall tone of your video should change depending on the company and career field. Hard to keep an overly enthusiastic tone when you're applying as a data analyst. It just wouldn't be genuine. \nAdd background music: I mean, don't add anything with vocals as it will distract from your voice. But adding a mellow background can help eliminate unwanted background noise.\nAnd lastly, prepare, prepare, prepare. Create that script! Can't emphasize this enough. \nVideo not for you?\nGet creative with a traditional resume.\nCreate resume\nBest video resume websites, editors and apps\nThere are a plethora of video CV applications on the web. Yet, not all are created equal.\nSome are clunky to navigate, others overpriced and many of them are jacks of all trades that excel at nothing. \nAnd as you’re aware, you might only get one chance to impress an employer. Hence, it’s important that you have the right software for the job. \nHere are 10 of the best video resume apps that will ensure you ease of use so that you can concentrate on the actual message : \nBiteable \nMovavi Video Editor\nSimplified\nTypito\nCanva\nLovo\nIntromagic\nFilmora\nAnimaker\nVistaCreate\nAlso, apart from these video resume editors, remember that in a creative field, many things are valid. You can even use your social media accounts, such as Instagram, Snapchat, or TikTok to deliver a job landing video resume.\n\nTikTok resume\nIt’s always good to keep up with the times. Just a few months ago the new social media giant launched a pilot program designed for recruitment and job discovery called TikTok Resumes. \nTikTok teamed up with companies such as Chipotle, Target, Shopify and many others to invite job seekers to apply for entry-level to experience-level positions through its platform. \nWhat a great way to showcase your creative video resume.\nHere are a few TikTok resume tips if you decide to go the TikTok route: \nAvoid sharing personal information\nCreate a video outline\nFilm vertically\nHighlight key-points with text boxes\nAdd soft music\nOh, and don't forget to use #TikTokResumes in your caption when publishing it.","URL Slug":"video-resume-guide:-how-to-make-a-good-video-resum"}}]}

But why is that? \nWell, it's because they play a key role (wink wink) in making your resume ATS-friendly. Without them, your job application simply won't reach the recruiters’ eyes even if you're the perfect candidate for the job. But more on that later. \nThe burning question is: How can you tell which resume keywords are the best for you? \nAnd that's exactly the question we'll be answering today! \nSo, if you're currently in the process of crafting your resume, be sure to continue reading our article and learn: \nWhat are keywords on a resume;\nHow to know which resume keywords to use;\nWhere to place your resume keywords;\nWhich keywords are the most sought after;\nAnd, conversely, which (key)words to avoid. \n\n Why care about resume keywords\nHowever, we can't delve into resume keywords without spending a few words on the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and keyword scanners. \nATS is an HR computer software specifically designed to streamline the recruitment process. It can help the hiring managers in several ways, but what's interesting for you is how it processes your resume:\nFirstly, ATS scans your resume for relevant keywords (parsing).\nSecondly, it awards your resume a percentage score based on how closely your keywords match those sought after by the employer. The more relevant keywords, the higher the score. \nAnd thirdly, it filters through the submitted resumes and ranks them based on the abovementioned percentage score. And the higher you rank, the more likely you are to get noticed by the recruiters. \nBesides the ATS, recruiters can also use standalone keyword scanners. But these function on more or less the same principles.\nThe bottom line is, in the world of job hunting, keywords are a pretty big deal. And you must get them just right!\nWhat are keywords on a resume\nSo, what exactly do keywords for resume look like? \nThey can be specific terms or phrases describing requirements that directly relate to the job you're applying for. They typically include essential skills, qualifications, experiences, and competencies that employers are seeking in candidates for a particular role.\nLet’s have a look at a specific example so you'd have a better idea of what we're talking about here.\nBelow, you'll find a mock job posting we've created with highlighted keywords. \n\nJudging by the sea of orange, you can see that pretty much anything can be made into resume keywords. \nBut if we continue to work with our example, we can break the keywords down into several categories: \nDegrees (Bachelor's degree in Marketing, Bachelor's degree in Communications)\nJob duties (developing, implementing, and managing digital marketing campaigns; develop and execute digital marketing strategies; conduct market research; etc.) \nSoft skills (Creative thinking, problem-solving abilities)\nComputer skills (Microsoft Office Suite, Google Analytics, Adobe Creative Suite)\nIndustry-specific hard skills (SEO, conversion rate optimization [CRO], Google Ads, Facebook Ads Manager, LinkedIn Ads, HubSpot, Mailchimp)\nHow to know what keywords to use in a resume\nAnd now that you've got a solid understanding of what resume keywords are and their importance, let's look at how you can find out what keywords to use in a resume you're currently working on. \nHere's how you can figure it out in 4 simple steps:\nStart by reviewing the job posting you're responding to.\nFirstly, review your job posting carefully and highlight any words or phrases that pop up (just like we did with our example). This step is by far the most indicative, since the job posting tells you what exactly are these particular employers looking for. \nResearch similar job postings.\nBut what if your job posting isn't particularly generous with the job requirements description? If that's the case, your next step should be to analyze job postings pertaining to the same/similar job position. Although precise requirements can differ from employer to employer, the basic skills needed to handle the job remain largely the same.\nConsider using online keyword research tools.\nAnother step worth exploring is to take advantage of tools such as Moz Keyword Explorer or the good old ChatGPT to identify relevant keywords related to your industry, role, and specific skills.\nLastly, check your resume keywords with AI Resume Rewriter.\nAlthough AI-powered tools can be daunting, navigating them is actually really simple and intuitive. Our AI Resume rewriter analyzes the content of your existing resume, as well as job postings for your desired job or industry. Besides suggesting new keywords, it can help you nail that professional tone and formatting. All you need to do is upload your resume and wait. That's it!\nFollowing these steps should provide you with plenty of potential resume keywords to choose from. But don't forget, the most reliable source of relevant keywords is always the specific job posting you're applying for.\n\nWhere to use keywords in your resume\nTo ensure that your resume is easy to read for both the ATS and the hiring manager’s eyes, your keywords should be weaved naturally throughout the whole document. \nYes, we know, it's really tempting to make a “Keywords section,” stuff it with all the necessary words and phrases and be done with it. But, unfortunately, that's simply not good enough. \nRemember how we divided the keywords from our example into different categories based on what types of skills/experience/requirements they represented? Well, all that effort will come in handy now! \nOrganizing your resume keywords in such a way gives you a good idea of where to later place them on your resume.\nKeywords for resume summary\nSince your resume summary’s main purpose is to hook recruiters by presenting your most impressive qualifications, it's a great place to start sneaking in those keywords!\nGenerally speaking, there isn't any rule as to which keywords should be featured in this section, but we do have two humble recommendations:\nThe title of the position you're looking to fill. \nHow many years of experience you have.  \nWhat these two? Well, that's because it's pretty difficult to fit them elsewhere. \nBased on our example, we could start our resume summary with: “Detailed-oriented Digital Marketing Specialist with more than 4 years of experience.”\nAnd voilà — two resume keywords with one stone!\nKeywords for education section\nSimilarly, your education section is also quite straightforward when it comes to keywords. Here, you can simply include keywords in the form of degrees if the job posting calls for any.  \nBut pay close attention to the wording! \nFor example: Our made-up posting uses the phrase “Bachelor's degree in Marketing.” Therefore, in your education section, you should write “Bachelor's degree in Marketing,” not “B.A. in Marketing”!\nKeywords for resume skills\nAnd, in your skills section, you should mention your skills. Yes, mind-blowing, we know! \nIf there's a place anywhere on your resume where it's okay to dump as many keywords as possible, this is it. Just make sure to further divide your skills section into sub-categories (like language skills, computer skills, interpersonal skills, …) for the sake of readability. \nAnd, if any of your skills are known in the industry by their acronyms, be sure to include this version of the keyword as well. \nFor example: Don't just write “conversion rate optimization,” or “CRO.” Instead, use both versions like so — “conversion rate optimization (CRO).”\nKeywords for work experience section\nFinally, we get to the most extensive part of your resume — your work experience section. And here, all gloves are off! You can incorporate a wide variety of keywords describing your skills, your industry knowledge, or job duties. \nAlso, don't be afraid of repetitions! In fact, the most important keywords should appear 2-3 times throughout your resume. \nAnd, one last golden nugget of information for you! If you want to avoid unnecessary words on your resume and come across as more proactive, turn your job duty nouns into action verbs. \nFor example like this:\nAction verbs on resume example\nDeveloped, implemented, and managed over 20 comprehensive digital marketing campaigns across multiple channels, including social media, email, and display advertising.\nDevelopment and executed digital marketing strategies resulting in a 30% increase in online traffic, a 25% boost in lead generation, and a 40% enhancement in brand visibility and engagement.\nConducted in-depth market research and competitor analysis, analyzing data from over 100 sources to identify trends, opportunities, and customer preferences.\nThe most in-demand resume keywords in 2024\nAs we've already mentioned, each and every job posting is unique and so are the keywords they contain. \nBut, there are several keywords that seem to be particularly popular with the employers at the moment. Have a look, why not? Maybe some of them will be suited for your resume as well. \nTop 10 resume keywords for hard skills\nData analysis\nProject management\nCloud computing\nCybersecurity\nBlockchain\nUX/UI design\nSoftware development\nStatistical analysis\nMachine learning\nE-commerce\nTop 10 resume keywords for soft skills\nCommunication skills\nAdaptability\nCreativity\nProblem-solving\nTime management\nLeadership\nCollaboration\nEmotional intelligence\nCritical thinking\nAnalytical skills\n\nWhat resume keywords to include based on your profession\nNow, let’s zoom in on three professions in particular and look at which keywords are the most widely expected to appear on your resume.\nAnd what a better way to show you how it works in practice than adding some stunning resumes to the mix! \nFYI, if any of these happen to catch your eye, feel free to use them as your first draft. Just click on the red button and write away!\n#1 Project manager resume keywords\nProject management is about making sure projects get done well and on time. It involves planning, organizing, and leading a team to reach goals within a set budget and schedule. Additionally, project managers help teams work together smoothly and solve any problems that might arise along the way.\nSome of the most relevant keywords for you are: \nProject Management\nAgile Methodology\nScrum\nWaterfall Methodology\nBudget Management\nRisk Management\nStakeholder Engagement\nTeam Leadership\nProject Planning\nSchedule Management\nCross-functional Collaboration\nResource Allocation\nCommunication Skills\nProblem-solving\nMilestone Tracking\nProject manager resume keywords example\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\n#2 Data analyst resume keywords\nData analysts sift through heaps of data to uncover important patterns and trends. By doing this, they help businesses and organizations make better decisions based on facts and figures. In a nutshell, they're vital parts of any company.\nSo, if you're looking to make a career as a data analysts, don't miss out on these neat resume keywords: \nData analysis\nStatistical analysis\nData visualization\nData mining\nQuantitative analysis\nData interpretation\nSQL (Structured Query Language)\nPython/R programming\nMachine learning\nStatistical modeling\nExcel/Spreadsheet proficiency\nData cleansing\nBusiness intelligence (BI)\nDashboard creation\nPredictive modeling\nData analyst resume keywords example\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\n#3 Sales resume keywords\nSales is all about building relationships and helping people find what they need. And so, sales professionals need to listen to customers, understand their needs, and offer solutions that make them happy. After all, it's about connecting with people and making sure everyone leaves with a smile on their face.\nOn your sales professional resume, don't forget to include these resume keywords: \nSales\nCustomer relationship management (CRM)\nBusiness development\nClient acquisition\nAccount management\nLead generation\nNegotiation\nClosing deals\nCold calling\nProspecting\nRelationship building\nClient retention\nSales strategy\nRevenue growth\nPipeline management\nSales resume keywords example\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\nWhat resume (key)words you should avoid\nSo far, we've talked (quite extensively) about all the keywords that shouldn't be missing from your resume. But what about the words that should be avoided at all costs? \nYep, there are such things as resume taboos, and we're going to explore them right now! \nOverused buzzwords. First of all, forget about hackneyed language like \"innovative,\" \"motivated,\" or \"dynamic.\" These words have been used so much that they've lost all meaning. Instead, demonstrate these qualities through specific achievements and experiences.\nPassive language. Remember action verbs? Now, meet their less pretty cousins. Verbs like \"assisted,\" \"helped,\" or \"participated in\" can make you sound like that one person in a group project that only came for the presentation. \nIrrelevant skills. A simple rule of the thumb — if it doesn't add value to your resume, it shouldn't even be on it! \nUnnecessary filler words. Finally, go through your resume one more time and be merciless. Every little piece of fluff like \"very,\" \"really,\" \"extremely,\" \"basically,\" or “pretty” must go! \nAnd there you have it, our short list of shame. Always proofread your resumes to remove these lapses of judgment and use more relevant resume keywords instead.\nKey takeaways: Resume keywords\nTo sum it all up, resume keywords are essential for making your resume ATS-compliant. \nResume keywords are specific terms or phrases that describe requirements related to the job you're applying for.\nYou can find them as: qualifications, soft skills, hard skills, degrees, certificates, years of work experience, job duties, and competencies.\nTo find out what keywords to use on your resume, follow these 4 simple steps: \nStart by reviewing the job posting you're responding to. Highlight any words or phrases that pop up. \nResearch similar job postings. Secondly, you can find inspiration by analyzing job postings pertaining to the same/similar job position. Because the basic skills needed to handle the job remain largely the same across all companies. \nConsider using online keyword research tools. Or, you can employ the help of keyword research tools freely available online.  \nLastly, check your resume keywords with AI Resume Rewriter. Besides suggesting new keywords, our Resume Rewriter can help you adjust the language of your resume to reflect your professionalism and  attention to detail.","Meta Description":"Learn how to Use These Resume Keywords to Pass ATS (+ Keyword Examples) and gain insights from real examples.","URL Slug":"use-these-resume-keywords-to-pass-ats-(+-keyword-e"}}]}

Especially if you haven't received a promotion or you haven't changed a job. \nHowever, once you take a look at your career in 2024 from a bird's perspective, you may realize how much you've professionally grown and learned over the past year. \nReturn to your last year's calendar, scroll through it, and see if you've: \ndone volunteer work\ntook a course and received a certificate\njoined a day-long training or a workshop \nlearned a new skill (e.g. working with software, basics of a new language, leading a project)\ncontributed to the company's success (e.g., are the sales numbers better or is there an increase in visitors since you joined the team?)\nIf you've answered “yes” to any of these, then your resume is asking for an update. Remember, even the smallest accomplishments matter and can make a difference. \n\n2. Know what to remove and what to keep\nOn the other hand, there might be some parts of your resume that you should get rid of. It's 2024, and no recruiter will be too interested in a detailed description of a task that you completed all the way back in 2005. \nWhy? \nRecruiters rarely look further than 15 years back unless the information is extremely impressive (e.g. degree from an excellent school) or relevant to the job they are currently hiring for. Otherwise, they're interested in your current skills and recent accomplishments. \nResume shouldn't be too long. And if you'd include every piece of experience, it would probably lead to pages of experience. The ideal resume should fit onto one or two pages. Definitely not more. \nSo make sure your resume focuses on your current and recent experience and excludes information irrelevant to your job search.\n3. Check your keywords\nOn average, hiring managers take only fleeting 6.25 seconds to look at your resume before concluding whether you’re a good fit for the position. And most of that time is spent skimming through your personal information and searching for relevant keywords that match the position.\nThese are the keywords that recruiters usually look for: \nqualities (e.g. experienced/senior/junior)\ncredentials (e.g. lawyer/certified nurse/PhD.) \njob titles (e.g. accountant/salesman/developer)\nskills (e.g. (UX/Excel/French/Java)\nMoreover, nowadays, most large companies are using ATS systems to filter through dozens of applications that they receive. \nBecause of that, make sure you include the right keywords in your resume. You should try and use the same ones that are used in the job posting for your desired position. Because if you don't, there is a high chance that your resume won't even be looked at. \n4. Know what to cut out\nAs stated above, the key to a strong resume is to include the right words. But so is AVOIDING the bad ones. \nUsing irrelevant and cliché buzzwords (such as ambitious, hard-working, or goal-oriented) or lying on your resume won't get you far. Be yourself and be authentic when writing your resume (what a cliché). You want your resume to be a true reflection of yourself and not a soulless template full of half-truths. \nFluffy jargon, clichéd phrases, exaggerations, and the overuse of vague terms are a waste of space. \nSo go through your resume once more, and if some parts sound like those worn-out phrases that you’ve heard before, feel free to erase them. The easiest way to cut the empty words talk and fluffy talk is to remove adjectives. Replace them with your accomplishments instead, and, most importantly, use action verbs. \nSo, you should do this: \nIn 2022, I have developed a method that increased the number of our company’s sales by 20% \nBy doing so, I have directly facilitated the growth of our sales department \nInstead of this:\nI am a hardworking salesman with a record of successfully closed sales\nFinally, your resume is meant to be your personal profile, giving the recruiter a genuine picture of your personality and skills. It’s always better to put aside the pretense or lies and go for sincerity.\nSteer clear from these pitfalls:\nPronouns like I, my, they, their, that, our, we\nPassive voice and noun-based verbs\nOverused adverbs like efficiently, diligently, or proficiently\nSubjective details like several or a high number\n5. Quantify your achievements\nThere really is no excuse for not quantifying your achievements in 2024. Not only do they look really professional, but they're also able to demonstrate your abilities better than a thousand words. \nJust take a look at this example: \nExceeded sales goals by 25% by bringing in 40 new clients.\nIt does make a much more persuasive argument about one's outbound sales abilities than a statement like this one, am I right? \nAn experienced sales manager with a track record of successful deals.\n6. Format your resume well\nResearch shows that recruiters prefer resumes that have a good ratio between text and empty space. And what helps you to achieve this spatial balance are bullet points, as they are much more effective in highlighting important data compared to plain paragraphs of text. \nIn other words, bullet points will make your resume much more skimmable and accessible to the reader. Recruiters can grab the information quickly, and you might be identified as a good fit for the position right away (which is exactly what you want). \nFinally, you should also choose the resume format that fits the needs of your career in 2024 the best. These are the three most common resume formats: \nChronological resume. The most suitable type of resume experienced professionals. “Work experience” is the most important section of this format, so it should be placed right under the contact information. In it, you list your detailed work experiences in reverse-chronological order.  \nFunctional resume. Choose this format if you’re changing careers this year. The functional format allows you to showcase your transferrable skills. So place the “Work experience” after the “Skills” section and make it shorter than you would in the more common chronological resume format. \nCombination resume. The combination of the two formats above. It allows you to put the relevant information first, but the work experience section should still be quite detailed. \n\n7. Check your contact information\nWhile this point may seem like an easy task to complete, keeping all your contact information up to date can be tricky at times. Once you have an existing resume, it can be tempting to just scroll below the top of the resume and jump over the contact information to pay attention to parts with more text. \nHowever, your resume contact section is of the utmost importance, as that's the place where recruiters look once they like your profile and want to contact you. And you want to make this process as simple as possible for them. \nSo, have you changed your phone number or email address recently? Or have you moved? Any changes of this nature should be reflected on your professional resume asap. \nIn the end, your resume contact information section should always include: \nyour full name \nprofessionally sounding email address\nphone number where you can be reached at all times\nOptional parts: \nhome address (include this if you live close to your potential new job)\nsocial media/LinkedIn/blog/portfolio (if relevant) \na photo (if its a norm in your country) \n8. In 2024, there are no excuses for ugly design \nFirst impressions matter. And when it comes to resumes, the first impressions are made visually. Strategic use of color or choosing a nice resume template can draw the attention of recruiters directly to your resume.\nColor can very effectively make your resume stand out from the sea of competitors. \nHowever, you have to be careful and purposeful when using bolder colors in your resume:\nIf you work in a creative industry or a startup, feel free to be more “out there.” Colors are very expressive, and you can showcase your personality and personal style using the design that represents you and your work the best.\nOn the other hand, if you're aiming for a career in a more traditional industry or a corporate, bold colors could harm your chances of landing an interview. Therefore, in this case, opt for a nice simple, yet stylish resume template. And if you still feel like adding a bit of color is the right choice for you, go for calm shades of blue, grey, or green.\nWant to give AI a try?\nKickresume’s AI writer tool will write the first draft of your resume for you.\nUse AI resume writer\n9. Make the most out of AI\nWhile just a few years ago you had to painfully craft the resume text all by yourself, now you don't have to. \nAI seems to be taking over the world (and the job search) in 2024. Utilize it and make the most out of it. \nSo you're unhappy about some parts of your resume, and you just can't get them to sound right, why not try out an AI resume writer? It will write the first draft of your resume for you, and all you have left to do is to edit and make sure that the information is 100% correct. \nIt has never been easier to write a resume. That is, if you know where to go. \n10. Tailor your resume to a specific job opening\nThis final tip is relevant at all times, not only in 2024. But we can't repeat it enough. \nMany people attach the same resume to all job applications that they send out. But they're are making a mistake. \nRecruiters are able to see generic resumes from miles away. Because of that, make sure that you tailor each resume that you send out based on the specific job opening.\nInclude the relevant keywords, highlight the most relevant experience or education, and leave stuff that is not necessary. \nFinal tips\nIn the post-pandemic remote work is increasingly more common. Today, many companies are offering the option of remote or hybrid work and are tempted to give these attractive positions to people who are already experienced in working remotely. So if you have such experience, make sure to highlight it. After all, it's a skill. \nSure, your resume is an essential part of your professional portfolio. But you should also try and showcase your professional abilities online on several social media platforms. Incorporate your brand message into your professional blog, online profiles (such as LinkedIn), and other relevant spaces. Being consistent pays off. Based on this, people who don’t know you in person — including recruiters — can form a coherent picture of who you are and where your career is heading. \nFinally, if you need more general advice about resume writing, read our full guide on how to write a resume.","Meta Description":"Learn how to Updating Your Resume for 2024?

But landing your dream job there starts with knowing the Indian resume format by heart.\nDid you know that the Indian resume format has some unique features that set it apart from its Western counterparts?\nTailored specifically to appeal to Indian employers, this format highlights your skills and qualifications while placing a strong emphasis on academic achievements, technical skills, personal details, and in some cases, even family background. \nAs a resume builder that’s helped over 2.5 million people create their resumes, many of them coming from India, we’re here to share our expertise and guide you through the ins and outs of the Indian resume format.\nIn this short guide, we’ll walk you through the essential components of an Indian resume, share some design and formatting tips, and provide a list of dos and don’ts to help you create a resume that gets noticed by Indian hiring managers. We'll also show you an Indian resume sample from a real person who got hired.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nUnderstanding the Indian resume format\nIndian resume format sample\nMain sections of the Indian resume format\nFinal tips for the Indian resume format\nUnderstanding the Indian resume format\nWhile in many aspects, the Indian resume format mirrors resumes from the rest of the world, there are some significant differences.\nGenerally speaking, the Indian resume format places greater emphasis on personal details, educational qualifications, and technical skills. \nWhile some aspects of the format may be considered unconventional by Western standards, they serve to showcase the unique strengths of Indian professionals. \n\nWhat are the key differences between Indian and Western resume formats? \nIndian resumes can be a bit longer. In the Western parts of the world, the length of your resume is ideally one or two pages. Yet, in India, recruiters and hiring managers often accept resumes as long as three pages. So don't hesitate to include more information on your resume that you'd, for example, in the U.S. \nResume formats are often detailed and elaborated. Compared to Western countries, in India, you can get away with relatively extravagant or creative resume designs. Indian resumes may use more decorative elements, including borders, colors, and different fonts. Western resumes, especially in the US, tend to have a more minimalist and clean design, with limited use of colors and a focus on readability. \nMore personal details. While Western resumes typically only include the candidate's name, email address, and phone number, Indian resumes often include additional information like date of birth, gender, marital status, religion, and sometimes even the names of the parents. That's because Indian recruiters may be interested in the candidate's family background. However, you should only share what you feel comfortable with.\nObjective statement. Indian resumes often begin with an objective statement that outlines the candidate's career goals and aspirations. Western resumes, on the other hand, tend to replace the objective statement with a professional summary that highlights the candidate's key strengths and accomplishments.\nEmphasis on academic qualifications and achievements. While Western resumes generally focus more on skills and work experience, the Indian resume format places significant emphasis on educational qualifications by providing detailed information about grades, ranks, and distinctions.\nTechnical skills and certifications. Indian resumes put an emphasis on certifications and a wide range of technical skills. These are typically listed in a separate section before the work experience section and are clearly divided by areas of expertise. Western resumes, on the other hand, tend to integrate technical skills within the work experience section or list them in a separate skills section without emphasizing certifications as much.\nNow that you know the key differences between Indian and Western resumes, let's have a look at a real resume sample from an Indian job seeker. \nIndian resume format sample\nSo, what does an Indian resume look like?\nTake a look at the Indian resume example below. It comes from a real person who got hired as a Junior Business Analyst at American Express.\nSee how “Corey Graves” emphasized his academic achievements, including earned grades, even though he already has professional experience. \nHe also cleverly opened his resume with a resume objective and used bullet points to structure his text. Thanks to that, his resume is extremely easy to read.\nJunior Business Analyst Resume Example\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as my first draft\nWhich resume sections are a must in your Indian resume, then?\nMain sections of the Indian resume format\nGenerally speaking, the Indian resume format follows all the established practices of good resume writing, such as being concise, relevant, and customized for each specific job position. \nYet, as stated above, there are a few formatting differences compared to American or European resumes. \nTo avoid making any mistakes, take a look at the essential sections that you should include in your Indian resume (and what to write there): \n\n1. Personal information\nFirst of all, just like any other resume in any country around the world, an Indian resume should always include:\ncandidate’s name\nemail address\nphone number\naddress (especially if you live close to the job you're applying for, be it your home address, student accommodation, or university)\nIn India, including personal details, like your gender, nationality, or religion, can help a prospective employer get a better mental picture of you as a candidate.\nBecause of that, on your Indian resume, you can also: \nInclude more personal details than in most other countries. Information such as age, gender, marital status, and nationality are acceptable. \nList your religion, race, or caste if it helps your candidacy (according to the Indian resume writing service Vibranturre).\nEnd the resume with a self-declaration and signature. Something like the following line will suffice, followed by your signature, date, and place: Declaration: The information stated above is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.\nHowever, only include personal details that will help you score the job.\n2. Resume objective\nWhile in the Western world, resume summary has slowly but surely replaced the resume objective, in India, it's more common to see an objective statement at the beginning of resumes. \nWhat's the difference between the two? \nA resume summary is a brief statement at the beginning of your resume that highlights relevant skills, experience, and accomplishments. It allows recruiters to see the highlights of your professional career.\nThe resume objective outlines your career goals and aspirations, providing the recruiter with a clear understanding of what you're looking for in a job and where you want to head in the future. In other words, it's future rather than past-oriented. \nThe best thing you can do is to go with the one that recruiters are the most familiar with in your country. And when it comes to India, a resume objective is still more popular.\nHere's an example:\nHighly skilled IT professional with 5 years of experience, seeking a Software Engineer role to leverage diverse programming expertise and contribute to company growth. Eager to embrace new technologies, collaborate with a dynamic team, and drive innovative solutions for client success.\nStill, if you choose to instead go with a resume summary, you probably won't make a mistake. \n3. Work experience \nThe work experience section is pretty standard, and even in India, you should follow the general rules that are also applicable in Western countries. \nYou should:\nChoose the reverse-chronological resume format, as it's the most common resume format in India. Place the most recent relevant work experience first and work backward through your previous roles.\nFor each of your past work experiences, write the name of the position, the name of the company, the location, and start and end dates.\nUse bullet points to structure the work section and make it easy to filter through.\nQuantify your accomplishments. When you use numerical data to support your previous achievements, you come across as professional and trustworthy.\nSelect only those experiences that are relevant to the position that you’re applying for. \n4. Education\nEven if you're a skilled professional with years of experience in the field, unlike in the Western world, education carries larger importance on your resume in India. \nSo, how should you go around it, and what should you include? \nJust like your experience, list your educational achievements in the reverse-chronological order with the most recent qualification first. \nInclude essential details such as the name of the institution, the degree obtained, and the year of completion.\nPlus, Indian resumes may also include more details about your academic achievements, such as marks or grades, certificates, ranks, and distinctions. \n5. Skills\nFirst of all, let’s define what resume skills we recognize. Generally speaking, there are two types of skills: \nHard skills (also known as technical skills) are those that are specific, measurable, and teachable abilities, such as programming, data analysis, or project management.\nSoft skills refer to personal qualities that are hard to learn, such as communication, problem-solving, teamwork, and time management, which are often harder to quantify.\nIn the Western resume format, the skills section is often one of the smaller sections on the resume, as job applicants include a lot of the skills directly in their work experience.\nHowever, in India, the “Skills” section tends to take up more space. Especially hard (or technical skills) are a must on the Indian resume, and they’re valued more than soft ones. Thus, make sure that you dedicate a separate section to your technical skills and properly highlight them in your text. \n6. Other resume sections\nApart from the essential resume sections, there are also other additional sections that you can include on your resume:\nCertificates. If you have relevant certificates, put them in a separate section called “Certificates” or “Courses.” In India, they're valued a lot. \nReferences. Indian resumes often include a list of references or a statement indicating that references are available upon request. While you don't have to put them on your resume, if you have an extra space in your resume, filling it with a reference creates a sense of professionalism and dependability.\nVolunteering. If you’ve ever done any volunteer work, don’t be shy to put it on your resume. It’s always a plus. Volunteering shows you’re a proactive, motivated, and socially conscious candidate who’s not afraid to take the initiative when it’s needed.\nLanguages. With India being a giant, multicultural, and multilingual country, the languages that you can speak make a genuine difference. However, include only those languages that you’re fluent in. If you took a German class in high school years ago, it doesn’t really count as an asset.\nApplying for a job in India?\nStand out with a resume that catches the eye.\nCreate resume\n\nFinal tips for the Indian resume format\nConsider including a photo. As opposed to resumes in the USA and the UK, the Indian resume format typically encourages a photo of a candidate. And while the resume picture isn't mandatory, it can often add a much-needed layer of authenticity and professionalism to your resume. Just any photo won't do it, though. The photo on the Indian resume needs to be a professional passport-sized picture of your face. \nStay relevant, be selective, and avoid mentioning unrelated facts. Many of the things people customarily put on their resumes (in India but also everywhere else) are often completely irrelevant to potential employers. Remove any information that won’t help an employer decide whether you'll fit for this specific position.\nDon’t get too personal or negative. Never mention your weaknesses, past failures, reasons for leaving your previous job, expected salary, and the like. Also, don’t include your father’s or mother’s occupations.\nBe honest. Aim to show yourself in the best possible light but never lie on your resume. If you get hired, your employers will quickly find out, and you’ll end up damaging your reputation.\nIf needed, print your resume. Even though most applications nowadays are digital, some companies may still require a printed resume. If this is your case, when it comes to printing, the Indian resume format uses white A4 size sheets of paper. Print only on one side of the paper, and never fold your resume.\nOnly include your current address. Many people in India include both their permanent and current mailing addresses. But this practice can only confuse a potential employer.\nEmail address. When it comes to the email address from which you're sending your resume, make sure it doesn't sound childish or unprofessional. When in doubt, get an email address in the \"name.surname@hosting\" format."}}]}

Final tips to consider before you press \"Send\"\n\n\nCHAPTER 1: Before You Start Writing\nLike all things, a good resume starts with having the right mindset. The mindset you adopt during writing will reflect in the impression your resume will give off once it's finished.\n\nYet, the most important thing about writing powerful resumes might sound a bit counter-intuitive at first: Your resume shouldn’t be about you, it should be about the employer.\n\nInstead, it needs to present you as a capable candidate who'll be an asset to the company you're approaching. Do you still have no idea how can you be an asset to a great company with your current skill level?\n\nWhy would anyone want to hire a fresh graduate?\nThere’s no reason to feel intimidated. Even if you have no experience under your belt, there are people out there who’ll be glad to employ you.\n\nStill, you might be asking, why exactly would an employer want to hire someone who has next to no experience?\n\nThere are several reasons. Keep these things in mind and make sure at least some of them reflect in your resume.\n\nQuick learning and adaptability. You’re a blank canvas. Since it’s probably going to be your first work experience, your employer will be able to shape you role however they see fit within the business.\nSaving on employee salaries. As an entry level employee, you’re probably willing to work for significantly lower salary than seasoned professionals.\nComfortable with new technology. Recent graduates have grown up around technology and have developed the ability to pick up new tools rapidly.\nInvesting into someone who shows potential. Talented people are scarce and far in between. If you invest into someone who shows potential early, your investment will return later.\nEnthusiasm. Everyone is excited about their first job and will work their hardest in order to make a good impression. Graduates bring bounds of creative energy and are more competitive than employers later in their career.\ncollege student resume\n\n6 Tips to Remember Before You Start Writing Your Resume\nManagers are expected to solve hundreds of tiny problems every day. Making the decision as for whether to hire you or not is going to be one of those problems.\n\nYou want to help them solve it as painlessly as possible.\n\nBe relevant. A hiring manager wants to know whether you’re going to bring value to the company and be a good fit for their company culture. Your resume should give them a clear answer to that question. Asking the ‘so what’ question witch each bullet point will help you achieve that.\nFollow the 6 seconds rule. Most recruiters only spend about 6 seconds reading each resume. Make sure your strongest points immediately discernible to make a recruiter give your resume a second look.\nPack your resume with keywords. Take a closer look at the job advertisement and scan it for a number of words that best describe the position. Include them in your resume. Incorporating keywords will help you get through these applicant tracking systems so your resume gets to a hiring manager.\nAvoid using buzzwords. Some phrases have been used so much in resumes they became meaningless. Avoid words such as “thinking outside the box”, “creative” or “problem solver.” For a more complete list, check this article.\nUse action verbs. While buzzwords are highly discouraged, there are some power words you might want to use. These include expressions such as “achieved”, “advised”, “delegated” and others. Check out this list for more.\nFit your resume on a single page. As a college student, you certainly don’t have enough experience to fill 2 pages.\n\nCHAPTER 2: How to Write a Great College Student Resume in 6 Easy Steps\nThe format of your resume will heavily depend on the information you have to work with. If you have a lot of of internship experience, you’ll want to highlight it just bellow your summary and education sections.\n\nOn the other hand, if you didn’t have any jobs related to your desired career, you can play up your education.\n\nIf the job requires technical skills like C# or Ruby, consider putting it just below the education section and right above your work experience.\n\nIn any case, always make your resume revolve around your greatest strengths and adjust its structure accordingly.\n\nLooking for your first job?\nStand out from your peers with a cool resume.\n\nCreate resume\n1. Personal details\nYou don’t have to fret too much about this section. It only becomes relevant once your resume catches an employer’s attention. For this reason, you also don’t want to give it too much space on the page.\n\nInsert it into the header of your resume and follow these simple guidelines:\n\nContact details. Put your name at the beginning of your resume. Don’t forget to include your email address and telephone number. Make sure your email address sounds professional. It’s nigh impossible to be taken seriously with an email address like sexyboy1990@hotmail.com.\nAddress. If your address is close to the workplace you’re applying to, include it in your resume as it could be seen as a positive. This can be an address of your student accommodation, college, or home address. Just put the one that’s closest to the job. Usually, it’s enough to provide your city and state, e.g. Kent, Washington.\nLinks to your online profiles. This includes your LinkedIn profile, personal website and/or your web portfolio. Don’t forget to customise your public LinkedIn URL so it looks something like this: “www.linkedin.com/in/yourname” (default version is pretty difficult to read or transcribe as it contains special characters and numbers). Just click the “Edit your public profile” button in the top-right corner of the page.\nDon’t include your photo. Be careful with this one! In some countries, including your photo is a common practice, in most others just an awkward faux pas. A great majority of experts agree that it’s better not to include a photo on your resume (and a college student resume is no different) unless you’re explicitly asked otherwise.\nExample: Personal Details\nYOUR NAME\nEmail: your.name@gmail.com | Phone: +1-202-555-0157\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/yourname | Portfolio: behance.net/yourname\n\n2. Professional Summary / Objective Statement\nYour resume should never focus on what YOU want. On the contrary, it should tell a potential employer why THEY want to hire you. What’s the best way to do it?\n\nWrite a professional summary that clearly summarises the key qualifications you have to offer a potential employer. Also, don’t forget to include any relevant experiences or skill that can set you apart from other candidates.\n\nLet’s say you worked your way through college financing your own education. This demonstrates your dedication and work ethic. Receiving a scholarship proves your academic excellence. Or perhaps you had a great internship experience. Take your time to pick those accomplishments that are closely related to the job you’re applying for. Most importantly, keep it short and relevant. Avoid anything vague.\n\nExample: Professional Summary\nMA English graduate with five years of experience in academic and creative writing.\nSuperior skill in communicating complex ideas in a clear and concise manner. \nAchieved high academic honours while maintaining part-time employment.\nICT background and closely familiar with SEO and the intricacies of writing for the web. \n\n\n3. Education Summary\nAs a fresh graduate or college student, you should put the education section above your work experiences. After all, your degree is probably still one of the strongest cards you can play at this point.\n\nTherefore, every college student resume should list their academic distinctions such as summa cum laude, scholarships, honours such as dean’s list, and other awards.\n\nOnly list your GPA if it’s higher than 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. If your overall GPA is lower than that, mention your major GPA. Highlight your accomplishments and consider adding those of your courses that are related to the job you’re applying for. If you’re yet to graduate, include your graduation date.\n\nExample: Education Summary\nUniversity of St Andrews, St Andrews, Scotland\nBA in Business and Marketing, Expected Graduation June 2017\n\nAcademic accomplishments: GPA 3.8 / 4.0, Dean’s list, Received second place in the university’s business plan competition\nRelevant coursework: Marketing Management, Survey Research, Strategic Internet Marketing, Integrated Marketing Communications, Marketing Analytics\n\n\n4.  Skills Summary\nDepending on the information you have to work with, it will be either the work experience or the skills section that will take up most space. If you’ve done several internships and have acquired some experience to speak of, you can simply follow regular resume guidelines.\n\nYet, the approach that most experts recommend in case of a college student resume is to focus on your skills. This is what they call a “functional resume.”\n\nRead through the job description again and select skills that are crucial for the position. See how they overlap with your own skills and group your experience under each of the respective skills headings.\n\nNotice that no company names or job titles are mentioned here. These will be listed in the work history section. However, don't hesitate to mention any class projects, volunteer work or extracurricular activities that demonstrate your ability and are related to your target job.\n\nExample: Skills\nWriting and Communication:\nDegree with an emphasis on clarity and structure in written and oral communication.\nWrote blog posts, news features, technical documents and marketing copies. \nFormer editor-in-chief of the university newspaper.\nExperience writing business and grant proposals, pitch documents and advertising copy.\nTranslated documents and interpreted conversations in Spanish, German and English.\n\n\nCreative and Analytical Thinking\nAnalysis of audience, purpose and style of documents. \nStrategic choice of wording, tone, format and source of information.\nAbility to take fact-based materials and make them interesting.\n\n\nSoftware and Social Media\nKnowledge of social media, blogging and digital marketing.\nExperience with Google Wave, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WordPress and Blogspot. \nManaged social media accounts with more than 30.000 followers in total.\n\n\n5. Work History\nIn the end, employers want to see those dates and positions. Now that you’ve done most of the work in the previous section, all there’s left to do is to list your work experiences chronologically. Include dates, company names, and job positions.\n\nDon’t forget to list your volunteering positions too. It might not be a paid work experience but it’s an experience nevertheless.\n\nAt the same time, volunteering looks insanely good on any college student resume. It speaks volumes about your character, work ethic, and social engagement.\n\nExample: Work History\nMarketing Intern — Wayne Enterprises, Inc., Gotham City — Summer 2014\nEditorial Assistant — Daily Planet, Metropolis — Summer 2013\nCleaning Officer — LexCorp, Metropolis — Dec 2012 –  Jun 2013\nSoup Kitchen Volunteer — Martha Wayne Foundation — 2010 – Present\n\n\n6. Testimonials\nDon’t be afraid to insert testimonials at the end of your college student resume. They say more about you than you could ever explain yourself. First, when you describe yourself, it can easily sound like bragging. Second, as a student, you have no authority yet. Let your mentors, supervisors, and professors do the bragging for you.\n\nWitch each testimonial, include the person's name, title and position. If they only gave you a full-blown recommendation letter, extract 1-3 sentences and make sure you don’t take them out of context.\n\nExample: Testimonials\n“Sally was always well organised and punctual with her work and her intelligence was evident. I hope you will consider giving her a place.” — Professor John Doe, University of Gotham City\n“I have no hesitation in recommending Sally for the job. She is a very good student, a hard worker, and will, I am sure, be an asset to your company and team.” — Dr Suzanne Smith, University of Gotham City\n\n\n\nFinal tips to consider before you press \"Send\"\nUse off-peak hours for maximum attention, especially if you’re reaching out to an employer directly. Hiring managers are busy people and you want them to receive your resume when they have enough time to read through it.\nAlways follow-up. If you receive no answer within several days after submitting your resume, don’t hesitate to send a follow-up email to remind the company of your application.\nBreak some rules. Don’t be afraid to adjust the resume structure we’ve outlined above. Always think about how can your college student resume best communicate your strengths.\nTailor your college student resume for every role. A generic resume will always miss the mark. It’s impossible to keep your resume relevant if you don’t consider particular demands of every job. Review the job description and modify your resume accordingly.\nYour formatting needs to be consistent. All typefaces should be the same and sizing should be consistent throughout a resume. The same applies to spacing and capitalising.\nCheck your resume for typos. Having typos in your resume means an instant death for your application. It portrays you as careless and even incompetent for not using the spellcheck feature in your text editor.\nAttach a cover letter. Your resume should never go unaccompanied. Write a short cover letter and insert it into the body of your email.

Job seekers hate writing it and nobody knows if anybody even reads cover letters anymore. And yet, not attaching one to your application would be a terrible mistake. This cover letter guide will tell you not only why to write one, but also how to write a really good one.\nBut first, why does everyone hate writing cover letters so much? After all, a cover letter gives you a unique opportunity to distinguish yourself from others.\nIn comparison with a resume, the cover letter allows you to provide details that didn’t fit in on your resume and demonstrate your passion.\nAll the negativity that surrounds the cover letter probably comes down to the fact that good cover letters require a bit of alchemy. They also take time to write.\nThis guide will help you avoid any mistakes and write a strong cover letter that will catch the recruiter’s attention. We also include cover letter examples.\nGenerally speaking, you want to make your cover letter:\neasy to read for the recruiter;\nwell-structured;\ntypo-free;\nmax 4 paragraphs/1 page long;\nprofessional in both tone and greetings;\ntailored for the specific opening.\nLet's get to it!\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nWhy should you write a cover letter?\nHow do recruiters read cover letters?\nHow to write a great cover letter in 9 simple steps\nWhat if you're told to NOT submit a cover letter? \nFinal cover letter tips and hacks\nCover letter examples\nWhy should you write a cover letter?\nSo, how exactly is the cover letter important for your job application? \nSome may argue that the cover letter in 2024 isn't really relevant anymore. In fact, one study stated that only 18 percent of hiring managers think cover letters are a key part of an application.\nHowever, don’t get fooled by these statistics. While your resume may be considered more important during the hiring process, including a well-written cover letter can increase your chances of landing a job. \nFor instance, 83% of hiring managers would be convinced by a really good cover letter — even if the resume wasn’t good enough, according to this study.\nAnd there's more to it.\n\nSome of the key advantages of the cover letter are:\nIt’s much less structured than the resume and lets you develop a story. \nIt gives you space to get a little more creative. \nYour personality can shine through thanks to it.\nYou can elaborate on key achievements mentioned in your resume.\nIt helps explain a lack of experience, career change, or an employment gap.\nIn other words, the cover letter is a perfect chance to bridge the distance between you and a recruiter even before the actual job interview. \n\nPro tip: Before writing a cover letter, make sure that you have a powerful resume that matches the job description. Because if your resume doesn’t fit a desired profile, your cover letter probably won’t get read at all. To learn more, you may want to check out our Ultimate Resume Guide.\nHow do recruiters read cover letters?\nFirst, they read them to decide if you’re the right fit for a position. For this reason, avoid generic write-ups at all costs. What recruiters love to see is a short persuasive argument of why you fit the role and the company. Something like this: \n“I was happy to hear about this job opening from my former manager, Jane Anne. She and I have worked together on many projects throughout the years and she thought that I would be the perfect match for this position.“\nSecond, recruiters are looking for inconsistencies. For instance, if your resume shows attention to detail but your cover letter is addressed to the wrong person, wrong company, and is filled with typos, it's inconsistent. You want to ensure the number of inconsistencies is kept to a minimum.\nThird, they're trying to get a hint of your personality. Cultural fit is important to many companies.\nSo, throughout the process of cover letter writing, it's essential to keep in mind the recruiter who's going to be the recipient of your letter. \nBecause at the end of a day, a good cover letter shouldn't be solely about you — it's supposed to be written with the hiring manager in mind. \nSo ask yourself: \nIs my cover letter easy to read?\nHave I addressed the right person in the opening?  \nWill it help them decide if I'm the right fit?\nDid I use the right tone of voice that fits their company culture?\nIf you answered “no” to any of these questions, our cover letter guide is exactly for you.\nHow to write a great cover letter in 9 simple steps\nWriting a cover letter may seem like a challenging task at first but if you know a few key cover letter rules, the process can become much easier. \nPrepare and do some research.\nBefore you start writing your cover letter, find out more about the company you're applying for. Look at their website and LinkedIn. The research also includes looking at the job description very closely and identifying any recurring keywords. Also, search for specific cover letter examples for the role online.\nInclude a header with basic information.\nPlaced at the very beginning of your cover letter, the header is where you include your contact information (i.e. your full name, email address, phone number) and the company's contact information (i.e. the manager’s or recruiter’s name, job title, department, the name of the company, company’s address). \nWrite a strong cover letter headline.\nWhen in doubt, try to use this formula: Number or Trigger word + Adjective + Keyword + Promise. The result can look something like this: 5 Ways I Can Help You Improve Your Company’s [insert a position-related keyword]\nUse the correct form of greeting.\nIf the name of the hiring manager isn't written in the job posting, research their name and contact information online. For example, look at the company's page or LinkedIn. Then, greet them by saying \"Dear [first name]\". If, however, the company culture is very formal, go for the classic \"Dear Hiring Manager\".\nFirst paragraph: Introduce yourself with a BANG!\nThe first paragraph is the perfect place to shortly explain why the job seems exciting to you and why you’re the right person for it. You can also compliment the company or name a mutual acquaintance who referred you.\nSecond paragraph: Explain why you’re a great fit for the company.\nTry to answer these questions:\n1. What did you do at a previous position that gave you relevant experience? \n2. How could this experience help the new company grow?\n3. Which of the projects you have worked on would benefit their business?\n4. Which of your skills make you well-equipped for the position? \n5. Do any of these skills give you an edge over other candidates?\nThird paragraph: Explain why the company is a great fit for you.\nThe following questions should help you:\nWhat excites you about the idea of working at this company?\nHow do the company goals align with your own?\nWhat do you hope to gain and learn from working there?\nClosing paragraph: Finish strong and stay in touch.\nIn the cover letter closing paragraph: reiterate that your experience and enthusiasm make you a great candidate, add a confident call to action, express gratitude, and always use a formal sign-off.\nHow do you send a cover letter?\nYou can either attach the cover letter as a separate document in the email when sending your resume, or send it directly in the body of the email (that way they can't ignore it).\nIn the following chapters we look at each step more closely and include specific examples you can copy and paste.\nStep 1: Prepare and do some research \nKnowledge is power. Before you begin writing:\nFind out more about the company and the position you're applying for. Spend some time on the company’s website, its executives’ Twitter feeds, and employee profiles on LinkedIn. It will also help you decide on the tone of your cover letter. For example, if it’s a company like Kickresume, you can easily get away with more unusual approaches. But if it’s a conservative institution, like a bank or a lawyer's office, you should probably keep it formal.\nSearch for specific cover letter examples for your role online. Pick some examples that fit your role and use these for inspiration. (By the way, that link just now will take you to our database of successful cover letters from real people who got hired. Totally worth checking out.)\nLook at the job descriptions of the roles you’re applying for. Identify major experience and hard skill keywords, so you can insert them in your letter in the relevant sections.\nOnce you've done this basic research, you can finally start thinking about the structure of your cover letter. \nThis short infographic will show you that writing a cover letter is a lot simpler than you might have thought: \n\nStep 2: Include a header with basic information\nPlaced at the very beginning of your cover letter, the header is the place where you should include your contact information and the contact information of the company. \nA cover letter is still a letter, after all. \nAt the left side of the page include the information based on which you can be reached by the recruiter. \nHere, make sure to include: \nyour full name\nyour email address\nphone number\nOptionally, you can also add:\nyour professional title\naddress (if it vaguely matches the location of the job offer)\ncurrent date\npersonal website/LinkedIn\nThe top right side of the page is reserved for company-related information. Here, you should put: \nthe manager’s or recruiter’s name (if available)\njob title \ndepartment\nthe name of the company\ncompany’s address\nNot a fan of writing?\nOur AI writer will write the first draft of your cover letter for you.\nUse AI writer\nStep 3: Write a strong cover letter headline\nWhen you’re browsing the web, what articles usually catch your attention? Those with great headlines, of course! \nThe same applies to cover letter headlines.\nStart by paying attention to the headlines around you — especially in tabloids and websites like Buzzfeed (Is Buzzfeed still a thing? How very 2010s of me). These are usually designed to stir up your interest and make it impossible to not click through. \nNotice how they use numbers, questions, and interesting adjectives to promise the reader to learn something valuable.\nAnd you can do the same in your cover letter.\nWhen in doubt, try to use this formula: Number or Trigger word + Adjective + Keyword + Promise. \nThe result can look something like this: \n3 Reasons Why I’m An Excellent Fit For [Job Position]\nAre You Still Looking To Fill The Position Of [Job Position]? This Is Why I Believe I’m Exactly Who You’re Looking For\n5 Ways I Can Help You Improve Your Company’s [insert a position-related keyword]\nFinally, don’t forget to adjust your header to the company’s level of formality and put your headline in the subject of the email.\nStep 4: Use the correct form of greeting\nIn this time and age, there’s no excuse for using “To Whom It May Concern.” \nIf the name of the hiring manager isn't written in the job posting, you’re expected to research their name and contact information online. For example, look at the company's page or LinkedIn. \nOnce you have their name, feel free to go for a personalized greeting: \n“Dear [first name]” or “Dear Mr./Mrs. [last name]” \nHonorifics (e.g. Mr., Mrs., Ms.) are more appropriate if the company’s culture is formal. \nAnd if you cannot find the recruiter’s name, it's okay to go for a generic: \n“Dear Hiring Manager”, or “Dear Recruitment Officer”\nAlternatively, you can address the letter to the whole company team or the HR department. In this case, your greeting should look like this: \n“Dear [name of the company/department] Team” or “Dear Human Resources”\nStep 5: First paragraph: Introduce yourself with a BANG!\nThe best way to start a cover letter is to open strong. The first impression matters the most and busy recruiters often have a chance to properly dive into only a few selected cover letters. \nSo if you make your first paragraph captivating, chances are that your letter will be one of the lucky ones that actually end up being read. \nIn fact, the first paragraph is the perfect place to shortly explain why the job seems exciting to you and why you’re the right person for it. \nWhile most people begin their letters with “I’m applying for the position X I saw in Y place,” it's a waste of space. \nInstead, open with a sentence like this:\n“I’m a content marketing professional with more than 5 years of experience and I’d love to bring my ability and passion to your team.”\nIn the first paragraph, you can also:\nCompliment the company. Show that you know details about the company and you’re approaching it for a reason. For example, demonstrate appreciation for what the company does. Not only will this flatter them, but it will also provide them with insight into who you are.\nName a mutual acquaintance if you can. This is sometimes called a “magic bullet,” as it’s the one thing that will assure the hiring manager reads your cover letter until the end. \nHowever, limit the introduction to 1-3 sentences. This isn’t the place to go into detail about what makes you ideal for the role — save that for the second and third paragraphs. \nStep 6: Second paragraph: Explain why you’re a great fit for the company\nThe second paragraph is the place where you should sell yourself and your experience. \nHere, write a short summary of your career, skills and accomplishments, tailored to fit what the company is looking for. \nYou already did your research, so now it's time to ask yourself these questions and try to address them in your cover letter:\nWhat did you do at a previous position that gave you relevant experience? \nHow could this experience help the new company grow?\nWhich of the projects you have worked on would benefit their business?\nWhich of your skills make you well-equipped for the position? \nDo any of these skills give you an edge over other candidates?\nAfter you’ve picked the most relevant accomplishments, put them at the start of your letter. \nHowever, when talking about them, avoid sounding like you’re bragging. The best way of doing this is to focus on your experiences rather than yourself. Ideally, support your claims with concrete examples.\nAlso, mention any other additional relevant hard skills or knowledge areas they’re looking for, as well as any qualifications.\nFinally, the second paragraph is the perfect place for showing that you’ve done your research. Demonstrate that you’re familiar with some of the challenges that the company faces and present how you can help them.\n\nPro tip: Don’t simply repeat the same things you’ve already put on your resume. You want to go beyond that (this applies to every other section of your cover letter). \nStep 7: Third paragraph: Explain why the company is a great fit for you \nIn this paragraph, you want to show that you’re serious about developing your career at this new company. And good companies want to know why they appeal to you and how will your professional relationship be mutually beneficial. \nConsider addressing the following questions:\nWhat excites you about the idea of working at this company?\nHow do the company goals align with your own?\nWhat do you hope to gain and learn from working there?\nFor example, you can say something like this: “I've seen on your website that you heavily focus on cryptocurrency projects. As a cryptocurrency enthusiast, I would love to join your team”.  \nHowever, don’t go overboard with flattery and stay professional. \nAlso, don’t say anything that isn't true or you don’t mean it, as it will probably come up again in the later stages of the application process.\nStep 8: Closing paragraph: Finish strong and stay in touch\nNow that you’ve nailed the main part of your cover letter, you also want to finish strong. This way, the recruiter will remember you in a good light. But how do you achieve that? \nReiterate that your experience and enthusiasm make you a great candidate. This is to emphasize the two main points from the previous paragraphs. Do this in one or two sentences, not more. \nAdd a confident call to action. In a sentence or two, you should suggest the next steps. Something like “I would love the opportunity to meet with you and discuss the value I can bring to [company].\"\nExpress gratitude. Simply thank them for their time and for considering your application.\nAlways use a formal sign-off. Something like “Sincerely, Best wishes, or Respectfully”. Finish by typing out your full name. \nStep 9: How do you send a cover letter?\nI can’t stress this enough — unless it's specifically required to attach the cover letter to the body of the email,  consider not sending your cover letter as a document attached to your email. \nInstead, put it inside the body of the email. The email itself is now your cover letter! This way the recruiter won't ignore it.\nHowever, remember that hiring managers receive hundreds of emails a day. So if you want your email to get read, it's the subject line that's likely to play the most important part. \nAs we've advised before, if you have a good resume headline, simply put it in the email subject. \nHowever, if you’re unhappy with the result, you have other options, too. \nFor instance, if you have a reference, include it already in your email subject line: \nReferral from Jose Nachos: Pedro Tacos, candidate for a senior software analyst position\nIf you don't have a reference or a catchy headline, check out more tips on how to write the best subject line for your email.\nFinished writing your cover letter?\nMake it stand out with an eye-catching design.\nCreate cover letter\nWhat if you're told to NOT submit a cover letter? \nToday, many companies are using online application systems that discourage applicants from attaching a cover letter. \nInstead, they have their own application systems where in different sections you're required to fill in the information you would normally place in your cover letter.  \nIf this is the case, just work with the format they gave you.\nIn other words, include the same information that you'd normally have in your cover letter but place it in the correct sections. \nAnd don’t forget to follow the cover letter principles: \nexplain why you're the right candidate;\nmake it clear that you've researched the company well;\nindicate in what way you'd be an asset;\nmention your biggest past achievements.\nBecause no matter the format, you're still expected to present your skills and convey enthusiasm about the job.\nAlternatively, you can also try to find a relevant manager or a recruiter online (either on the company pages or LinkedIn) to whom you can send a brief follow-up email with an attached cover letter. \n\nFinal cover letter tips and hacks\nNow that we've covered the basics, there are several other tips that you should keep in mind to elevate your cover letter to the next level: \nKeep it short. Limit your cover letter to three to four paragraphs and a maximum of one page. Hiring managers are busy people who often don't have time for reading long texts.\nKeep it clean and easy on the eye. Take a look at how this article is written. It’s replete with short paragraphs, sentences typed in bold letters, bullet points, and numbers. All of these make reading and searching for specific information easier. So, never send a letter that looks like an unreadable wall of text. The easiest way to achieve a sleek cover letter design is to use a pre-formatted cover letter template. \nDon’t risk being funny if it’s a company with a formal work culture. Poorly executed humor will hurt your chances rather than help. Being direct and dynamic is a much surer way to catch the recruiter’s attention than a number of jokes. On the other, if the company is smaller or known for its creative products, being original may in fact help your chances! \nShow, don’t tell. Usually, there’s no point in saying you’re “a dependable hard worker” or “a creative thinker.” Why should anyone believe such generic statements? Instead, offer an example of how these qualities helped you achieve something in the past.\nNever write the same letter twice. A cover letter should always be tailored to a specific job application. Remember the previous sections? You’ve made a great effort to research the company and its hiring managers, so you’ve written your cover letter accordingly. This is a process you need to repeat with every application (ugh, I know). \nCheck for typos. This goes without saying but make 100% sure your cover letter is without typos. There’s no reason to believe you're competent if you can't even type without errors. Moreover, typos automatically reveal almost criminal carelessness on your part, since every text editor nowadays has a spellchecking feature. \nDon't use any buzzwords. Your cover letter needs to be authentic and persuasive — and buzzwords are neither. If anything, they simply give the impression of you being someone who's just trying to fit a skewed idea of what an ideal corporate employee should be. Instead, focus on using relevant keywords from job descriptions.\nNow, if you have no experience yet because you're just starting out or you're changing careers, writing a cover letter can be scary. However, a well-written letter can actually be your best friend.\nAnd this is how you write the perfect cover letter with no experience.\nCover letter examples\nIn the end, there are many different ways to write a great cover letter. And even if you follow the cover letter guide above, you’ll end up with a cover letter that's invariably your own. \nIt all depends on your own personality, the position you’re applying for, and the hiring manager’s preferences. \nAnd that's good, actually! \nStill, there's a lot to learn from cover letters written by other people. That's why we've selected five cover letter samples that deserve your attention. \nEach of these helped real job seekers find real jobs in real companies.

In fact, the preference for skills-based resumes has been steadily growing among employers and employees alike, according to a recent report. \nWondering what makes this approach a game-changer and how you can benefit from it? \nWelcome to our comprehensive guide where you'll find:\nWhat is a skills-based resume;\nWho is it for;\nHow to write a skills-based resume; \nA skills-based resume template.\n\nWhat is a skills-based resume?\nA skills-based resume is a type of resume format, which allows you to put forth your best qualities relevant to the job you're interested in.\nThis is achieved by making the “skills” section the main focus of your resume, while the “work experience” and “education” sections take the back seat. \nWhy is the emphasis on skills so important? \nEven if job titles stay the same, the tasks, projects, and things you can learn from them can vary a lot. In the professional world, people in the same job position don't always have the exact same skills. Each person's unique set of skills is shaped by their individual experiences, tasks, and personal growth.\nWho is a skills-based resume for? \nChoosing the right resume format is all about pointing the recruiters' attention to your strengths and away from your weaknesses. And choosing the right strategy (i.e. resume format) depends on your situation. \nA skills-based resume may be an excellent choice in case you:\nWant to change careers. You decided to step into uncharted territory and switch careers or industries. \nAre a recent graduate. Finding a job right after graduation is notoriously difficult, mainly because you don't have any professional experience. \nHave little to no relevant experience. Your interest in a specific job may come from volunteering or pursuit of your passion outside of work. \nHave a gap on in resume. You may have chosen to take a break from your career for any personal or health-related reason. \nAre a job hopper. You've held a great deal of different jobs, but not for a very long time. \nAll of these scenarios have one thing in common: lack of continuous, long-term work experience in a specialized position.\nWhich is why you want to make the recruiters notice your skills first.\n\nSkills-based resume vs. chronological resume: What's the difference?\nThe key differences between a skills-based resume and its more traditional counterpart (chronological resume) lie in their focus and structure. \n1. Focus \nA skills-based resume focuses on your, well, skills. It answers the question “What can you do?” rather than “Show me where have you worked.”\nA chronological resume, on the other hand, focuses on presenting work experience in reverse chronological order. Chronological resume is a great fit for seasoned professionals with a stable work history. If you've been on a consistent career path, with each job building on the last, this is the format for you.\n2. Structure\nThe difference in their focus also reflects in their structures. Both skills-based resume and chronological resume dedicate the largest portion of their layout to showcase relevant skills and work experience respectively. \nSkills-based resume structure\nContact information. Include your name, phone number, email, LinkedIn profile, and relevant social media accounts.\nProfessional summary. A short section which briefly states your career objectives and most relevant skills.\nSkills (main focus). This is the most extensive and detailed section. We'll take a closer look at what to include in this section later in this article. \nWork experience. If you have any, include 2-3 most recent ones (there probably won't be space for more).\nEducation. You should list them in chronological reverse. \nOptional sections. May include volunteering, certificates, licences or awards.\nChronological resume structure\nContact information. Include your name, phone number, email, LinkedIn profile, and relevant social media accounts. \nProfessional summary. Briefly state most notable experience and qualifications.\nWork experience (main focus). This is the most extensive and detailed part. Presents work experience in reverse chronological order. Details daily tasks and accomplishments connected to each of them in bullet points. \nEducation. Also chronologically reversed. \nSkills. Eg. language competence or computer skills. Show the level of skills without much detail - most typically through infographics. \nOptional sections. May include volunteering, licences, certificates or awards.\n\nPro tip\nYou may have heard someone referring to skills-based as a functional resume. It’s basically the same and these two terms are used interchangeably. \nHow to write a skills-based resume: step-by-step\nBy now, we've identified the main attributes of a skills-based resume and established who would benefit most from using it.\nLet's look at how to create an effective and well-organized skills based resume in 8 steps.\nStart with research!\nGo back to your job posting. Try to identify repeating keywords and phrases describing what the ideal candidate for that particular position should be like.\nCustom tailor your resume to the specific job.\nEach resume you send out has to be especially tailored to a specific job description. If you're struggling to identify what skills you need for a particular job, feel free to read job postings for the same position at different companies.\nCreate a clear resume header.\nAt the top of your resume, include a contact/personal information section which has your name, phone number, email, LinkedIn.\nIntroduce yourself with a compelling profile/summary.\nA 3-5 sentences long resume summary should highlight your key achievements and skills. It's an introduction to who you are professionally. Your summary must be concise, to the point, and eye-catching at the same time.\nLet your skills take the centre stage.\nThe skills section should be the most prominent one, both visually and content-wise. You can organize your skills into categories to highlight different aspects of your abilities. Tailor them as closely to the job description as possible.\nMention your work experience.\nYou can be bries as this is not the main focus of a skills-based resume. Arrange your work experience entries in reverse chronological order, stating: your employer's name, dates of employment, and the role you held.\nDon't forget to showcase your education.\nMake a note of: the name of the institution, what did you study, dates of study, and your GPA (if it's something you can be proud of).\nShow additional skills through optional sections.\nFor example, include: certificates, awards, references, or licences pertaining to the job you wish to pursue. \n In the following chapters, we look at each step in more detail and give you helpful tips and examples.\n\nStep 1: Start with research!\nBefore you start writing, you must do a bit of research. Go back to your job posting. Read it again. Try to identify keywords and phrases describing what the ideal candidate for that particular position should be like. \nUsually, you can find these under the heading “requirements” but it's not always that simple. The keywords you're looking for can be sometimes embedded in the text.\nIf you want to get invited to a job interview, you must show the recruiters that you have what they're looking for. Make sure your resume always caters to the specific needs of each job posting you respond to. \nStep 2: Don't forget to always custom tailor your resume!\nEach and every resume you send out has to be especially tailored to a specific job description. This is the golden rule. \nIf you're struggling to identify what skills you need for a particular job, feel free to read job postings for the same position at different companies. The competences should be somewhat similar across the board. Bonus points, if you also research the company and their culture.\nStep 3: Create a clear resume header \nRegardless of the format, every resume needs a header. Usually, it sits in the top-part of your resume. Make sure the header is clearly visually separated from the rest of the text.  \nStart with your full name in a slightly larger font, making it the focal point.\nInclude your contact information, such as phone number and professional email, ensuring they're easily accessible. If you're applying for a job abroad, don't forget to add correct country code before your phone number ( e.g. +421 *** *** ***).\nAdd your LinkedIn profile, personal website, or relevant social media accounts if relevant. In case you have all of the mentioned, pick only a few that will feature in your header.\nConsider adding a photo. Including a photo in your resume is a topic of debate and it usually depends on location and industry.\nStep 4: Introduce yourself with a compelling profile/summary \nWrite a concise summary at the beginning of your resume, highlighting your key achievements and skills. Treat it as an introduction to who you are professionally.\nA resume summary should:\nBe about 3-5 sentences long\nConnect your skills to real-world accomplishments to add context\nMention your most impressive credentials and accomplishments\nIt should also be specific, to the point, and eye-catching at the same time.\nConsider the following resume summary example:\nResume summary example\n“Dedicated marketing professional with a robust skill set in digital strategy, content creation, and social media management. Proven track record of driving engagement and increasing brand visibility across various platforms. Proficient in SEO optimization and data analytics, with a keen eye for identifying market trends. Seeking to leverage these skills to elevate brand presence and contribute to dynamic marketing initiatives in a creative environment.“\nIf you're fresh out of school, your resume summary can look like this:\nStudent / recent graduate resume summary example\n“Eager and detail-oriented recent graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Proficient in programming languages, including Java and Python, with a strong foundation in software development principles. Adept at problem-solving and collaborating within team environments, as demonstrated through coursework projects. Excited to apply theoretical knowledge gained during academic pursuits to contribute to real-world projects and continue learning in a professional setting.”\nStep 5: Let your skills take the centre stage\nThis section is the most prominent one, both visually and content-wise.\nYou can organize your skills into clusters or categories to highlight different aspects of your abilities. Align them as closely to the job description as possible.\nUse sub-headings. Ideally, these would be directly connected to the key words found in the job posting. For example, if the advertisement calls for a candidate with time management, leadership, and communication skills, these should be your sub-headings. \nGet into specifics. Underneath each subheading, put 3-4 bullet points where you will expand more on each skill. Describe your background with that skill and, if possible, also your successes. \nUse quantifiers (if possible). The truth is, job descriptions tend to be quite vague. Anyone can write that they have good communication skills, and perfect time management. But what exactly do these phrases mean? Using quantifiable metrics will show the impact of your contributions more effectively.\nTake a look at these examples. Each deals with “leadership skills'' but from a different standpoint. Let's imagine that the first example was written by a person (A) leading a marketing campaign. Their skills description would look like this: \nLeadership skills example A\nLed a cross-functional team of 15 members, resulting in a 30% improvement in project efficiency. \nSuccessfully guided a group through a challenging project, resulting in a 25% reduction in turnaround time. \nDemonstrated effective leadership in implementing new strategies, contributing to a 15% increase in team morale and collaboration.\nThe second person (B) has spent the last two years working in retail, making their way up to the position of a store manager. Their “leadership skills” could be specified as follows:\nLeadership skills example B\nLed a retail team of 10 employees, fostering a collaborative environment that contributed to a 25% increase in overall sales.\nImplemented effective training programs resulting in a 20% improvement in employee performance and customer engagement. \nUtilized motivational strategies, leading to a 15% decrease in staff turnover and improved team morale.\nWhat skills can you include in your skills-based resume?\nIn your skills based resume, you should include both hard and soft skills.\nSoft skills. They're also called transferrable skills and are characterized as interpersonal, non-technical know-how. Transferable skills are skills you've acquired through experience in one job position; but which can also be applicable in different professional contexts. These are gained over time and cannot be taught using a textbook. Communication, time management, and leadership are all examples of transferable skills. \nHard skills. These are specific, technical proficiencies that can be learned, measured, and quantified.\n1. Soft skills\nThese are especially useful to career changers, recent graduates, or people with little work experience – people who would benefit from a skills-based resume.\nSoft skills are more about your personal qualities and how you navigate the social aspects of your job. \nSoft skills act as a universal toolkit, highlighting your flexibility and professionalism. Spotting and highlighting these skills on your resume is key.\nIf you aren't sure which soft skills to incorporate into your resume, take a look at top soft skills employers can't resist. You'll certainly find a few you are good at.\n2. Hard skills\nAnother kind of skills you can draw from are hard skills. These are specific, technical proficiencies that can be measured and quantified.\nExamples of hard skills include technical skills like:\ncoding\ndata analysis\nusing specific software and tools (Microsoft tools, Photoshop, etc.)\nlanguage skills\nHard skills are often job-specific and can be precisely defined and evaluated.\nStep 6: Mention your work experience\nAs this is not the main focus of a skills-based resume, let's be brief.\nArrange your work experience entries in reverse chronological order, stating:\nyour employer's name, \ndates of employment, \nand the role you held.\nDon't go into detail on your competences and responsibilities – this isn't the space for this. Any relevant skills should be addressed in the “skills section”. \nRemember that internships also count as work experience. \nYour work experience entry can look something like this:\n\"XYZ Events Company | Party Organizer\nJanuary 2021-November 2023\"\nStep 7: Don't forget to showcase your education\nAgain, list your education entries in reverse chronological order. Make a note of:\nname of the institution,\nwhat did you study,\ndates of study,\nyour GPA (if it's something you can be proud of ;) )\nHere is an example of what your education entries can look like:\n“St. Andrew's University, Scotland\nBachelor of Science in Communication Technologies\nGPA 3.9 | 2016-2020“\nStep 8: Show additional skills through optional sections \nDo you feel that there's still more to share? There's a way to sneak them in. \nIf you have some space left, you can dedicate it to anything that can boost your value and desirability.

Barbara made sure we won't overlook her name. \nHer inclusion of both her phone number and email address enables recruiters to access her contact details easily. \nIn her summary/profile, you'll notice her usage of keywords, such as “effective team player,” “communication,” or “time management.” She directly states what value she'd bring to the company.\nBarbara divided her skills section into several categories, each with its own sub-heading. \nShe decided to list her hard skills (languages and computer skills), as well as her soft, or transferable, skills (communication, multitasking, teamwork, critical thinking, etc.).\nNotice that instead of bullet points, she decided to indicate the level of her skills via infographics. While it gives the resume a more sophisticated and sleek look, recruiters may find this less persuasive.\nHer education entries are in reverse chronological order. \nSince Barbara is yet to finish her studies, she lacks any practical work experience. Instead, she chose to highlight her volunteering experience. \nFinally, she included a section “certificates” where she mentions her driver's licence. At first, this might seem redundant, but this is a common requirement in many professions.\nEveryone knows that formatting resumes is a particularly tedious and annoying ordeal. Why waste time battling with divisions and margins – with these resume templates you can have a skills-based resume in seconds. Save yourself time and sanity. Be like Barbara.\nWant a skills-based resume yourself?\nWith our Resume Builder you can have a skills-based resume in seconds.\nCreate resume\nKey takeaways: Skills based resume\nA skills-based resume prioritizes skills over work history, offering a unique approach to showcasing your abilities, qualifications, and competences.\nIt's ideal for career changers, recent graduates, those with limited experience, gaps in employment, or varied job histories – for anyone who doesn't have a continuous, long-term work experience history. \nYou can include any relevant soft (transferrable) or hard skills that will convince the recruiters that you are the right fit for the job.

They're trying to sneak onto your resume.\n\nSo which one should you listen to? Should you be “I” or “she” or “he”?\n\nOne of the first decisions you need to make before starting to write your resume is whether you want to write in the 1st or 3rd person.\n\nThroughout the few past decades, there’s been an ongoing discussion about which voice to use in your career documents.\n\nAnd HR expert’s views have been changing, too, taking different sides every time.\n\nBut don’t worry, we've sorted this issue out for you. Here’s the contemporary approach to the dilemma of writing your resume in the 1st or 3rd person.\n\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n\nFirst person, third person and pronouns\nWhat if you still want to use pronouns?\nFirst person\nThird person\nBack to basics\n\n\n\nFirst person, third person and pronouns\nThe secret to a fresh, outstanding resume is to remove the pronouns entirely.\n\nPronouns are redundant. Try it for yourself—get rid of all instances of ‘I’, ‘he’ or ‘she’ from your resume. It won’t change a thing. Their use is implied and everyone will know who you’re talking about.\n\nWhat’s more, pronouns take up a lot of space on your resume that you could fill with verbs and adjectives instead. Without them, your resume can start to breathe more freely and make your skills and experience shine.\n\n\nLet’s take a look at an example:\n\nFirst person: ‘I managed a stock room of 20,000+ items.’\nThird person: ‘He managed a stock room of 20,000+ items.’\nSure, you could get away with either of the two. On the other hand, there are just too many reasons that make them useless in modern resume writing.\n\nThird person feels rather strange. When was the last time you've heard someone refer to themselves as \"he\", \"she\" or...\"Mike\"? 😅\n\nWhen it comes to the first person, using it you can easily come across as a bit boring, repetitive or egocentric.\n\nNow remove the pronouns:\n\n‘Managed a stock room of 20,000+ items.’\nWow! Can you see that? This phrasing is far more effective and concise.\n\nYou can avoid the inevitably repetitive pronouns. And the whole resume will, in turn, read far more naturally.\n\nBy using this approach, you’ll soon be able to craft short, succinct bullet points speaking of your past achievements.\n\nPut pro nouns on a pro resume.\nGet hired fast with a standout resume.\n\nCreate resume\nWhat if you still want to use pronouns?\nBut even after reading all this, it might be too hard for you to say goodbye to your pronouns.\n\nThat's perfectly fine. You just need to stay aware of their function.\n\nYou should definitely feel free to write your resume in either first or third person. Both of them are acceptable but they can be tricky to work with.\n\nFirst things first. If you do decide to use a pronoun, be careful to follow suit and use the same pronoun throughout your resume.\n\nConsistency is key. Jumping from 1st to 3rd person pronouns—and leaving them out from time to time too—can easily result in not getting invited to a job interview.\n\n\nFirst person\nUsing the 1st person to talk about yourself sounds very logical. It’s also more direct, engaging and personal.\n\nBut as soon you’ve used the word “I” once, it becomes really tricky.\n\nIf you want to stay consistent, you’ll have to start repeating yourself—or come up with very innovative ways to keep your I’s in check. \n\nLast but not least, use 1st person pronouns sound informal, even unprofessional.\n\nWhich means that unless you're applying for a highly creative position, you should steer clear of using it at all.\n\nThird person\nThird person is accepted as a standard resume convention. Looking a bit too formal, it keeps your resume impersonal and reduces the chance of sounding too egocentric.\n\nThis style also creates the distance necessary to enable the HR manager to focus on your skills and value rather than your personality.\n\nIf you decide to go with 3rd person, however, don’t use your name to say things about yourself. Starting off with “Shervin is an expert in…” will come across at best strange and at worst slightly creepy.\n\nAfter finishing your resume, read it aloud for yourself and try to evaluate the tone of its voice.\n\n\nIf it makes the impression that you wrote your resume as a testimonial or if it sounds like you’ve got somebody else to write your resume, the work is not over yet.\n\nBack to basics\nAt the end of the day, it’s facts that matter. Everybody knows you’re going to talking about yourself in your resume. So using a pronoun feels just like bringing sand to the beach.\n\nThe plain truth is that HR managers and recruiters crave for a simple, honest resume. They’ll always lean towards candidates whose resumes are easier to digest. And the fewer pronouns there are, the less time they'll have to spend reading it.\n\nA standout pronoun-free resume will focus on content loaded words such as nouns, verbs and adjectives. Anything else is an obstacle that recruiter’s eyes will have to jump over.\n\nThis is why you need to weed out any confusing or unnecessary elements and keep only those that are there for a reason.\n\nLet’s sum it up\nThis article has brought light to a couple of pain points in a job seeker’s resume. If you decide to put them into practice, you’re sure to become a well-versed resume creator with an impeccable career document in your hands.\n\nHere are 4 basic rules for a simple but powerful resume:\n\nWrite in the past tense.\nFocus on things you have achieved.\nWrite in the 3rd person but eliminate any pronouns.\nUse short bullet points to strip out any unnecessary fillers words.\nNow it's time to let your skills do the talking.

(Tips & Examples)\n\nTo include your GPA on resume or not to include it — that is the question.\nWhen you're in school, your GPA seems like the single most important estimate of your success. But is it really that important for your potential employer?\nIn order to create a killer resume you have to carefully pick which components are relevant and important enough to include in your resume. \nTo help you make the right decision, we’ve created a short guide to everything you need to know regarding GPA on resume!\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nWhat is a GPA?\nShould you put a GPA on your resume?\nDo employers check your GPA? And how important is it, really?\nHow to put a GPA on you resume?\nShould I mention a GPA on my LinkedIn profile?\nWhat is a GPA?\nYour GPA, which is short for Grade Point Average, is a number that evaluates how well you did during the entirety of your degree program. It’s meant to place you on a GPA scale between 1.0 and 4.0 — with 4.0 being the perfect score. \nAverage GPA is 2.8 , however, only a value higher than 3.5 on a 4.0 scale is impressive enough to include on your resume.\nThere are a few different types of GPAs, however, only two of them are relevant to your resume — Overall GPA and Major GPA.\nOverall GPA refers to the overall grade from all the courses you took in college.\nMajor GPA considers only the grades you got in your declared major.\nSimply pick the one that is higher. Additionally, you should go for your Major GPA when it is more relevant to the job you’re applying for. \nImpressive GPA?\nMake sure your resume is just as breathtaking.\nCreate resume\nShould you put a GPA on your resume?\nThe truth is that adding this component to your resume is optional. Because of that, it can be a little tricky to decide whether to include your GPA on resume or not.\nIn some cases yes, it can be a nice way of highlighting your good performance, however, in other cases it can actually harm your chances of getting a job.\nWhen to include a GPA on your resume\nGenerally, you should include your GPA on resume if:\nYour potential employer requests GPA on resume\nYou're applying for your first job\nYou've been out of school for under 3 years\nYour GPA is 3.5 and higher\nThis goes without saying, but if an employer requests that you include a GPA in your resume, then you have to respect that no matter what score your GPA is.\nIf you're still in college or this is one of the first jobs you're applying for, naturally, you have little to no relevant work experience. This is when your GPA can be regarded as an indicator of your performance. But remember, only if your GPA is higher than 3.5 on a 4.0 scale.\nA score lower than 3.5 is not particularly noteworthy and can actually decrease the chances of you being hired. \n\nWhen not to include GPA on a resume\nIn some cases, including a GPA score on your resume can also be a pretty bad decision.\nAvoid listing your GPA on resume if:\nYour GPA is lower than 3.5\nYou've been out of school for more than 3 years\nThis is not your first job application\nScore lower than 3.5 is not bad, however, it's not really worth mentioning either. Many people have an average GPA, which means you won't stand out. Instead you'll blend with everyone else.\nAdditionally, your potential employer can regard a lower GPA as an indicator of weak work ethic. \nThere's a point when your GPA simply becomes less important. Trust us, you don't want to be the 36-year old still flaunting their GPA at every chance they get.\nSo, when you're out of school for more than 3 years or you've had a job before — relevant work experience and professional achievements matter a lot more.\nDo employers check your GPA? And how important is it, really?\nThe truth is that many small companies don't care about your GPA, and therefore, they'll probably not check the validity of the score.\nHowever, large companies often expect to see your GPA — In fact, 67% of companies said they screened candidates by their GPA, according to a survey.\nSimilarly, in 2018 when the National Association of Colleges and Employers asked employers about the influence of the attributes employers seek on a candidates resume — a high GPA was rated 3.4 on a 5-point scale, which accounts to a moderately high influence:\nSource: Job Outlook 2018, National Association of Colleges and Employers\nAs you can see from the chart above, your GPA influences employers’ opinions even more than your extracurricular activities, studies abroad, or your volunteer work.\nAlso, in a Forbes interview with Dan Black, the director of recruiting for the Americas at Ernst & Young, he says about GPA: “It’s really one of the only indications we have of a student’s technical ability or competence to do the job.”\nSo, do employers check your GPA? As you can see, very often they do.\nIt's important to be honest, as employers normally request a copy of a student's transcript in one third of cases. After all, you don't want to be remembered for lying on your resume, do you?\n\nHow to put a GPA on you resume?\nIf you decide to include GPA on your resume, you need consider a few things.\nWhere do I list it? Should I round it up? If so, do I round up or round down? What's the difference between cumulative and overall GPA? Or should I use my major GPA instead? \nDon't worry — keep on reading to get all the answers.\nWhere do I put my GPA on resume?\nFirstly, it's important to know where to place your GPA on your resume. You have two options:\n1. Education section\nPut your GPA directly in your resume education section. Which should look something like this:\n\n2. Achievements section\nAlternatively, you can include your GPA in your resume achievements section. However, when you decide to opt for this option — your GPA score should be very high.\n\nWhat about rounding up your GPA?\nYes, you can round up your GPA on resume. However, you should only round up to one decimal place. In some cases, you shouldn't be rounding up at all. And finally, you may even have to round down. \nHow many decimals should a GPA score have? The standard is one decimal place. \nHere are some examples:\n3.49 GPA would round up to 3.5\n3.43 GPA would round down to 3.4 \n3.98 GPA would round down to 3.9 — this is because 4.0 GPA is reserved for the perfect score, which is not rounded and is truly 4.0 (consider leaving it at 3.98 in such case)\nA correct rounding of a GPA on your resume is particularly important in areas such as banking, investment and finance. Learn how to make your banking resume stand out.\nCumulative GPA? Major GPA? Overall GPA?\nIt can seem a bit confusing. But here's a simple table of differences:\nCumulative GPA: An average grade of a particular semester or term from one particular institute.\nOverall GPA: An average of all the cumulative GPAs.\nMajor GPA: An average based on all upper division courses attempted in the major department or required by the major.\nBasically, your potential employer doesn't care about the GPA you got during a particular semester or term. They care about your absolute performance which is judged on the basis of overall GPA.\nTherefore, use overall GPA on your resume.\nMajor GPA is okay to use on your resume as well. Sometimes it's even better to use major GPA rather than overall GPA. This is either when your major GPA is higher than overall GPA or —  when your major is very relevant to the job you're applying for.\nShould I mention a GPA on my LinkedIn profile?\nWell, basically all we've mentioned regarding GPA on resumes applies for LinkedIn as well. Do put your GPA on LinkedIn if you're still a student or you've recently graduated and your GPA is impressive — 3.5 GPA and higher on a 4.0 scale.\nDon't put GPA on your resume if it's lower than 3.5 on a 4.0 scale and you have had some work experience after graduating from university. As you acquire work experience, GPA becomes less important for your potential employer.\n\nChristy's word of advice\nIf you’re a recent graduate, a good GPA is definitely worth including, as it gives potential employers insight into how well you’ve mastered the academic side of a particular subject. If it’s lower than you’d hoped, just leave it off and focus on other details such as final year modules (which can be great ATS keywords), thesis title, and any academic societies you were involved in. After you build up some work experience — let’s say a year or two — your GPA will be less important anyway, so you can simply leave it off.\nChristy Morgan, Resident HR Expert\nKey takeaways\nHere's everything you need to know regarding a GPA on a resume:\nDo include your GPA on resume if:\nYour potential employer requests GPA on resume\nYou're applying for your first job or you've been out of school for under 3 years\nYour GPA is 3.5 and higher\nDon't include your GPA on resume if:\nYour GPA is lower than 3.5\nYou've been out of school for more than 3 years\nIt's not your first job application\nLarge companies often expect to see your GPA because it's one of the only indications of a student's ability and performance — And yes, they do check it.\nWhen you decide to include your GPA in your resume, place it either in the education section or the achievement section.\nYou should round up or round down your GPA score so that it only has one decimal place. Do this with caution.\nUse overall GPA or major GPA depending on which one is higher.\nYou can put GPA on your LinkedIn profile too — it's optional and same rules apply."}}]}

How to Talk About Your Past Projects\n\nMost of us have already signed one but only a few of us have bothered to read it.\nYes, we're talking about the infamous NDA — a formidable document that prevents you from talking too much about your work.\nIn other words, the non-disclosure agreement is a legal contract that helps companies make sure their employees won't leak any confidential information.\nHowever, these juicy details may come in extremely handy when writing a resume, creating an online portfolio or getting ready for a job interview.\nRead on to learn how to cope with the limitations posed by the NDA and make it work towards the outcome you really want.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nFirst, pick up your NDA and read it\nDifferent NDAs, different rules\nNon-disclosure agreement vs resume: Focus on the results\nOnline portfolio: Communicate the value of your work\nDon't miss the chance to stir up some drama\nFirst, pick up your NDA and read it\nIn fact, adding confidential accomplishments to your resume or online portfolio is not forbidden. It just requires you to think smart and master the art of possible.\nEven if you had to sign an NDA, there's no reason to freak out. These documents aren't supposed to silence the employees but rather protect the company issuing them.\nThey can't silence your resume.\nLeave them speechless with a standout resume.\nCreate resume\nThe first thing you should do, then, is grab the copy of your NDA and read it through.\nUnderstanding the agreement is your key to be able to push its boundaries. Take your time to study it over and over again until you fully understand it along with the caveats it entails.\n\nDifferent NDAs, different rules\nFirst, you need to realise that not every NDA contract is the same.\nThe thing is, NDAs reference the information not to be disclosed as confidential in nature. That generally concerns technical documentation, information which is non-public and which would be detrimental to the company interests if it were to get out.\nHowever, NDAs vary pretty widely in what's forbidden to be talked about.\nSome agreements are extremely restrictive, whereas others are pretty loose and hiding the client’s name is enough. And some NDAs are even set to expire after a certain time period (go check that first).\nMost of them won't let you discuss the details of the project but — perhaps except for the CIA — most of them do let you discuss the existence of the said project.  As long as you don't slip out any information a competitor might glean an advantage from, you should be perfectly fine.\n\nNon-disclosure agreement vs resume: Focus on the results\nYou may be thinking everybody's eager to hear about the final product. But, in fact, it's not your destination but your journey that reveals the most about your work — your expertise, personality or skills.\nRemember, those who are reading your resume don't necessarily need to know the project itself. They want to see the results, and as far as you can describe those, you've done your job well.\nRather than disclosing any confidential details — such as techniques used or client names — focus on the value that you brought to the process. Describe the position in terms of technologies, size or objectives and refer to your job responsibilities and achievements.\nThe description of your work, without breaching the NDA, could then sound something like this:\n\"Lead international business teams that included members from multiple Fortune 100 companies, ensuring successful delivery of multi-year, industry leading projects.\"\n\"Developed and implemented client service program for a leading tech company, which expanded small-to-medium client base 35%.\"\n\"Advised three Fortune 500 companies on database performance issues.\"\nEven if your projects happen to be under an ironclad non-disclosure agreement, there's always a way to deal with it.\nBy using adjectives to hint at your employer's prestige and including the Fortune ranking lists, you're free to discuss any responsibilities and achievements you deem particularly important.\n\nOnline portfolio: Communicate the value of your work\nHere's another scenario.\nYou've just finished your best work to date and realized adding it to your online portfolio would give your career an intergalactic boost. However, NDA has shattered your plans of discussing crucial parts of your project that make your skills stand out.\nA real bummer, that is. Or maybe not.\nFirst, don't let the NDA make you lose heart. Try to explore various different ways to communicate the value of your protected material.\nDepending on the type of your NDA, you may have to think beyond the project to achieve the same results:\nWrite a short blog post about what you learned working for Company XYZ to describe your journey and highlight your expertise.\nTurn your attention to a side project in which you demonstrate similar skills as in your protected project.\nDrop the name of Company XYZ in the clients' section of your portfolio to show you have collaborated with them or worked for them.\nRemember, a signed NDA should never be an excuse for an empty portfolio. You need to identify the value of your work and look for alternative ways to communicate the desired message.\nDealt with the NDA?\nPick a nice CV template and make it look good.\nCreate resume\nDon't miss the chance to stir up some drama\nJob applications hardly ever cause recruiters to raise an eyebrow. So why not put in a little teaser to spice things up a bit?\nMention the NDA on the margins to let them know you must take extra care to avoid violating the agreement.\nIt's far more interesting to reveal a bit of something and then say that you cannot talk about it any further. Sounds terribly juicy, to say the least!\nLet's throw in an example or two to help you get the idea:\n\"Evaluated mission-critical information for a confidential project at industry dominant company (subject to a non-disclosure agreement; no further details available)\"\n\"Managed a multi-million budget for a confidential project (subject to NDA, no further details available) at Fortune 100 company.\"\nDon't worry, though, your prospective employer will definitely respect the confidentiality of the information. What's more, they may even appreciate your professional integrity in sticking to the NDA, which in turn may boost your credibility and trustworthiness.\nAnd that sounds like a great win-win situation, doesn't it?\nUse our AI resume builder to create a resume that highlights your capabilities and respects confidentiality.","URL Slug":"resume-vs-non-disclosure-agreement?-how-to-talk-ab","Meta Description":"Learn how to Resume vs Non-Disclosure Agreement?

And we've got some pretty great insights into the latest resume statistics and trends! \nIn this article, we'll show you the top 7 findings of the analysis and discuss how you can use them to your advantage as you craft your own resume. \nHere's what we found:\nThe majority of job seekers use one-page resumes.\nThe use of AI resume writer is on the rise.\nResume summary & objective are neglected.\nJob seekers love action-oriented verbs.\nFiller words still seem to be a problem.\nOur most popular resume template is Ladder.\nNearly half of job seekers don't accompany their resumes with a cover letter.\nThe data was collected and analyzed by our internal data science team, allowing us to provide an in-depth look into the resume-writing process.

Should you fit your resume into one page? Or is a two-page resume acceptable? \nThese are some of the fundamental questions every job seeker asks. So, let's have a look at the resume length statistics for more insight. \nOur analysis shows that the majority of resumes are between 200 and 400 words long — 69% of them, in fact. At Kickresume, 200 to 400 words usually fit on a single-page resume.\n\n17% of resumes were slightly longer, containing between 400 and 600 words.\n7% of resumes contained between 600 and 800 words. \nThe rest of the resumes (7%) were longer than 800 words. \nWe even found 29 resumes longer than 10,000 words. That's a bit of an overkill.\nThis data tells us that the majority of job seekers try to limit their resumes to a single page.\nThat's usually a good strategy, especially for entry-level workers, college graduates, and people looking to make a career change, since these job seekers usually don't have that much work experience in the field yet.\nHowever, this may not be the best approach for those with more work experience. If you're a seasoned professional with 10+ years of experience, you don't need to shy away from using a two-page resume.\n#2 Use of AI resume writer is on the rise\nAI resume builders are becoming more popular among job seekers. \nKickresume's AI resume builder was used by 70,831 unique users in 2022, which constitutes 13% of our users. In other words, every eighth job seeker utilized our AI tool. And this number is still growing.\n\nNo wonder — there are many benefits to using AI. These tools can build your resume from scratch, enhance existing resumes with AI-generated content, or optimize them for specific job postings — invaluable if you struggle with writer's block and want to make life a bit easier.\nTo make sure you don’t fall behind other job seekers, try out our AI resume writing tool in your next job search. \nAfter all, writing is always easier when you already have a draft at hand. \nHow to use Kickresume’s AI resume writer?\nSign up or log in to your Kickresume account. When logged in, on the dashboard scroll down to Your Documents and click on Create New. \nWhen filling in the Work Experience section, enter your job title, click Use AI Writer and the AI will generate a number of bullet points for your work experience descriptions.\nTo create a full resume using AI, in Your Documents select New resume with AI and fill in a short 2-minute questionnaire. \nAll that’s left then is to edit the text to make it “more you”.\n#3 Resume summary & objective — important yet neglected\nEven though a resume summary (also known as a career summary or resume statement) and a resume objective are two slightly different things, they do share a common denominator. They're the few-sentences-long paragraphs that sit at the top of your resume and provide a snapshot of you as a candidate. \nYet, our analysis of over 170K resumes shows that only 37% of resumes included a resume summary or objective. \n\nThat's not very good news. \nWhy? \nIn the modern world, a resume summary or objective belongs among the standard resume sections. It allows recruiters to quickly scan what you consider your top qualifications for the job.\nIn fact, recruiters agree that a well-written resume summary/objective will almost always catch the eye of a seasoned recruiter.\nHence, if you want to increase your chances of your resume being noticed by a hiring manager, don't be a part of the 63% of job seekers who didn't include this paragraph in their resume. \nAnd, if you're not sure how to write a resume summary or resume objective, our guide will provide all the information you'll need to craft one. \n#4 Job seekers love action-oriented verbs\nThe next resume statistics we looked at was the use of action-oriented verbs and phrases in the analyzed resumes. \nWe found that out of all resumes, 93% included 1 or more action-oriented phrases. \nAnd, 33.5% of resumes actually included between 10 and 20 action verbs, which is the ideal amount per one document. \n\nThat's really good news! \nCompared to noun-based verbs and passive voice, action verbs are shorter, clearer, and bring a level of confidence to your resume. \nHence, using action-oriented verbs can make your resume more engaging and easier to read, ultimately increasing your chances of capturing the hiring manager's attention.\nLet's have a look at an example of action-oriented vs. non-action-oriented phrases:\nNon-action phrase: I have been a part of the employee performance evaluation process. \nAction-oriented phrase: Evaluated employee performance using available data.\nAs you can tell, the first example is wordier and contains unnecessary word fluff. The second phrase is clearer and more confident. \nOur resume statistics show that a vast majority of people already use action verbs in their resumes. \nHowever, if you're a part of the 7% who still isn't using them, here's some inspiration for your upcoming job search: \nExamples of action-oriented verbs\nAccelerated, accomplished, administered, assembled, budgeted, built, calculated, coached, collaborated, designed, directed, distributed, engineered, executed, generated, guided, handled, implemented, initiated, launched, lectured, led, moderated, oversaw, pinpointed, published, reduced, simplified, streamlined, tracked, upgraded, wrote, etc.\n#5 Filler words still seem to be a problem\nWith hiring managers spending as little as six seconds scanning your resume for important information, you don't want to crowd your resume with words that don't add any value. \nYet, this seems to be a bit of a problem for job seekers. \nOur data shows that 44% of resumes contained 10 or more filler words. \nWhat's more, almost 5,000 resumes contained 40+ filler words. That's a lot!\n\nSo, what exactly are filler words? In the context of resumes, filler words are pronouns like I, we, their, my, that, which, etc. Moreover, certain adverbs can also be considered filler words. These are words like always, frequently, actively, thoroughly, etc. \nAnd why are they the pest of resumes? These words don't add any value to the content of your resume and create unnecessary fluff that only takes away attention from the important information you need to convey in a limited time (and space).\nIn a way, it's kind of like using words so, like, uhm, well when speaking. \nHere's how to eliminate filler words in your resume:\nExclude any pronouns, like: I, my, they, their, that, our, we.\nUse action-oriented verbs and phrases instead of passive voice and noun-based verbs. \nExclude any overused adverbs, such as: efficiently, diligently, proficiently, significantly, quickly, and thoroughly.\nAvoid subjective details, like: several, a high number. Instead, use specific numbers.\n#6 The most popular resume template is Ladder\nAt Kickresume, we also specialize in resume design. We offer 35+ resume templates designed by a team of professional typographers, graphic designers, and recruiters. \nIn 2022, Ladder became the most popular template among our users. It was used by every tenth user, adding up to over 51,000 resumes with this design. \nHere it is in all its glory: \nLadder Resume Template\n\nUse this template\nThere are a few reasons why this particular template gets so much attention. \nUses the classic black-and-white combination to visually divide the sections and headings. \nIt's not too “creative”, yet not boring. There are no extra elements apart from those that are necessary. However, you can change the color of the section headings and the experience level dots in the skills section to add an extra zing. \nIt's a single-column template. The traditional single-column template allows more space to elaborate on your experience and qualifications. Plus, it's more ATS-friendly.\nSome of the other popular templates include Midday, Rhubarb, or Stanford. Have a look at all 35+ resume templates.\n#7 Nearly half of job seekers don't accompany their resume with a cover letter\nWell, they either forget about them or just hate them enough not to write one at all. \nOur analysis found that 45% of job seekers didn't create a cover letter along with their resumes. \n\nHowever, not writing one at all may be a big mistake. \nCompared to a resume, the cover letter allows you to provide details that didn’t fit in on your resume, demonstrate your passion, and show a bit of your personality.\nIn fact, a survey revealed that 83% of recruiters agree that a cover letter plays an important part in making their hiring decisions. \nTherefore, we strongly recommend you create a cover letter along with your resume.\nHere are 3 ways to write a cover letter without having to pull your hair out:\nLet an AI cover letter writer make one for you. Kickresume’s AI cover letter writer can generate role-specific cover letters that look and feel a lot like cover letters written by real people. You can use it as your first draft and edit it to make it more \"you\". \nDraw inspiration from real cover letter examples. In our cover letter database, you’ll find example letters from different industries belonging to real people who got hired. \nFollow a step-by-step guide to writing a cover letter. In this ultimate cover letter guide, you'll learn what to include in the header, what greeting to use, what to write in each paragraph, how to sign off, and more. \nResume statistics: Concluding remarks\nThis analysis of over 170,000 resumes created on Kickresume in 2022 presents some valuable resume statistics and reveals interesting trends and common mistakes in resume writing:\nThe majority of job seekers try to fit their resumes into a single page. However, this may not always be appropriate. \nThe use of AI to craft resumes is increasing, and it's no surprise, given the speed and efficiency it provides.\nTwo-thirds of resumes didn't include a resume summary or objective, even though these are considered standard resume sections.\nJob seekers love action-oriented verbs and can't get enough of them (hiring managers, too). \nFiller words continue to infest resumes even though it's fairly simple to get rid of them. \nThe most popular resume template is an ideal balance of standard but not boring, according to resume statistics.\nNearly half of the job seekers ignore cover letters in spite of the fact that hiring managers value them.","Meta Description":"Learn how to Resume Statistics: We Analyzed Over 170K Resumes & Here’s What We Found and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

Struggling with how to organize the sections of your resume? \nSometimes you can feel like what you have isn't enough and then overcompensate by trying to include as many categories on your resume as possible. In these cases it's good to remember the golden rule —  less is more.\nRather than trying too hard and ending up with a cluttered resume, you should stick to what is necessary. And add any optional sections which will complement it depending on your profession. \nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nIllustrative examples of resume sections \nResume composition explained in 2 simple steps\nStandard resume sections \nOptional resume sections\nHow to organize your resume sections?\nIllustrative examples of resume sections \nLet's start with illustrative examples that show how sections should be ordered on a resume based on where you're in your career — whether you're a student/fresh graduate, an experienced professional or a career changer.\nExperienced professional resume example\n\nStudent/fresh graduate resume example\n\nCareer changer resume example\n\nIf you want to organize your resume in a seamless yet creative way, a quick and efficient solution is to use a customizable template. Just choose a suitable resume template for your profession and customize it to your needs.\nResume composition explained in 2 simple steps\nSo, how do you put together your own resume?\nFollow this two simple rules:\nYou need to include the required sections. Your resume won't be a resume without those.\nOther sections are optional and you can include those which are somehow relevant to your career or to the job you're applying to.\nWhich sections are a must and which aren't? Let's see!\nStandard resume sections \nEvery resume should, definitely, include these five key sections: \nPersonal information\nResume summary or objective\nWork experience\nEducation\nSkills\nThese are the most important parts of the CV for a recruiter. You shouldn’t leave any of them out. When you include these five sections, you'll have produced a standard resume with all of the necessary information.\nAny additional sections, if added tastefully, are cherries on top.\nLet’s have a look at each of these five individual sections to make sure you include everything you need to. There are also some different options for headings, some of which are more appropriate than others.\nTip: If you already have a great LinkedIn profile with all the information, there's no need to create a resume from scratch. You can simply convert your LinkedIn profile into a resume in one click.\n1. Resume personal information section\n\nWhat's the purpose of the personal information section on a resume?\nYou’ve probably guessed it. The purpose of the personal information section on your resume is to introduce yourself to the hiring manager. Therefore, it should be the very first section on your resume.\nWhat should you include in personal information section?\nName and surname\nPhone: If you're applying for a job in a different country, make sure you include the correct prefix code for your country. Be consistent with the format of the number in other documents.\nEmail: Make sure to use a professional email rather than a goofy one back from when you were a teenager. Similarly, don't use your current work email. You will loose it soon anyway! \nAddress: Usually recommended, but not necessary. Some employers send offers and rejections via post, or they may prefer local candidates living in a certain radius from the company. However, it can also lead to discrimination, especially when you decide to include your zip code — so, preferably include at least the state and city. \nThere's also optional personal information you can provide:\nProfessional acronyms: Including any professional title abbreviations, education, certification — You earned them, go for it!\nMiddle name: Optional. But make sure you're consistent in other documentation. \nLinkedIn and other social media: LinkedIn — Recommended if you have one. Other socials — Is it relevant for the job or industry? If yes, you can include it.\nPortfolio/Website: Again, include only if it's relevant for the job. In a creative industry it will definitely help!\nLastly, if you want to work with applicant tracking systems (ATS) and not against them, stick to a straight-forward heading, like \"Personal Information\" or \"Contact Information\". Stay away from headings like \"Something about me\".\nWhy is the personal information section necessary on a resume?\nNaturally, by providing all the necessary information, recruiters will have no trouble getting in touch with you and invite you for an interview.\n2. Resume summary or resume objective section\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the resume summary or objective section on a resume?\nThe purpose of this section is to tell the hiring manager who you are and why you’re a great fit for the job or what your professional goals are (depending on whether you opt for summary or objective). Think of it as a teaser for the rest of your resume.\nShould you use resume summary or objective?\nIf you’re a student or recent graduate and have some experience, use a summary. In case you don't have any experience yet, use a resume objective to explain your future career goals.\nIf you’re an experienced professional, use a resume summary to list your strongest skills and professional achievements.\nIf you're a career changer, use a resume objective to communicate your motivations and emphasize your transferrable skills.\nWhat should you include in resume summary or objective?\nResume summary:\nWrite 3-4 lines (or bullet-points) of text summarizing how much experience you have, in what industries/markets.\nHighlight any specific skills or accomplishments you are particularly proud of.\nTailor it to suit the job you want by adding keywords and related skills from the job listing — this will also give you a head start with ATS systems.\nJust FYI, a resume summary is sometimes also called a “professional summary” or a “resume statement”. Either is perfectly fine to use as a heading. \nResume objective:\nHighlight your motivation, future goals and any relevant transferrable skills.\nMake it short and sweet, ideally 2-3 sentences long.\nConnect your skills and abilities to the job you want.\nUse specific keywords from the job listing to help your resume get past the ATS.\nWhy is resume summary or objective necessary on a resume?\nOn average, hiring managers only give each resume 7.4 seconds of their time. Hence, why a good professional summary or objective is a must.You want to grab their attention from the get-go. Plus you’ll make their life a bit easier because you’ll immediately tell them who you are. As for the resume objective, it can also help you convince the hiring managers that you’re qualified for the job despite lacking industry-relevant experience. \nIf you’re still wondering how to write a professional summary and resume objective, make sure to check out our guide: How to Write a Professional Summary on a Resume?\n3. Resume work experience section\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the work experience section on a resume?\nThe purpose of this section is to show that you’re a great fit for the job by providing a detailed summary of your past relevant work experience. It should give the hiring managers an overview of what jobs and job titles you’ve held in the past and should demonstrate your professional growth.\nWhat should you include in the work experience section?\nList this section inreversed chronological orderby starting with the most recent work experiences. Include:\nthe name of the company you worked for;\nwhere it is located;\nyour job title;\nand for how long you’ve worked there.\nThen you want to include:\n3-5 bullet points highlighting your past achievements for each entry. Don’t use this space for simply listing the job description and your responsibilities. It will then seem like you did the bare minimum. Focus on the positive results instead.\nIf you lack relevant achievements, show your problem-solving skills. Explain how you’ve solved a specific problem in the past.\nTailor it according to the employer’s needs and priorities. Do this by searching for any recurring keywords, skills or experience mentioned in the job listing and then explain how you’ve demonstrated that skill in your previous jobs.\nQuantify your results. For example, instead of saying you “increased daily website visitors” rather say “increased the website’s daily visitors by 30%”.\nUse professional headings for this section. By doing this, you’ll avoid being excluded straight away by ATS systems. Quirky headings probably won't be recognized by ATS. Simply name it “Work Experience”. \nIf you're not sure how many jobs to include, check out our article How Far Back Should a Resume Go?\nAnd in case you’re a student or recent graduate, use this section to mention any relevant part-time jobs, summer jobs, volunteer work or internships you’ve had (following the same tips above). \nWhy is the work experience section necessary on a resume?\nYour work history section is the most important part of your resume. When you think of a resume, the work experience section is probably the first thing that comes to your mind. And you’re not alone. Based on this section employers determine whether or not you have what it takes for the job. \nFor more, have a look at our guide: How to Describe Your Work Experience on a Resume?\n4. Resume education section\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the education section on a resume?\nThe purpose of this section is to show employers what your educational background is. By including all of your degrees and relevant academic accomplishments in the education section, you can impress your employer and show you have the necessary background. Moreover, if you have a degree from a prestigious university, it can give you an advantage over other potential candidates.\nWhat should you include in the education section?\nIf you’re an experienced professional, it’s enough for you to mention your highest degree. Only include 3 things:\nname and location of your university;\nname of your degree or field of study;\nyear when you started and graduated.\nIf you’re a recent graduate, education section is the core part of the resume. Hence why you should make sure to make this part a little longer by adding extra details to make it prominent. Extra information to add to the education section are:\nRelevant coursework\nGPA (if higher than 3.5)\nAwards (Dean’s list, magna cum laude, subject-based awards)\nScholarships\nRelevant student societies (especially if you were in the committee and played an active role)\nAcademic publications\nStudying abroad\nInternships \nThesis name and description\nWhy is the education section necessary on a resume?\nEmployers are naturally interested in your educational background. Some top companies even have specific degree requirements for their applicants. You should always include education on your resume, no matter where you’re in your career. However, as you become more experienced, you should keep it only brief.\nFor example, after you’ve gained 5-10 years of practical experience as a teacher, you can simply state that you have an MA in education as your work experience is now more important.\nBut if you’ve recently graduated, it’s naturally the most important part of your resume. \nCheck out our comprehensive guide: How to Put Your Education on a Resume?\n5. Resume skills section\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the skills section on a resume?\nThe skills section of your resume shows employers you have the skills and abilities required for the role. In fact, a well-written skills section can help convince hiring managers to interview you. However, remember that you should demonstrate these skills in the work experience section as well.\nWhat should you include in the skills section?\nJust follow these simple rules:\nWrite a list of your key skills.\nCheck the description of the job you want and match your skills.\nCreate a skills section and consider dividing up the section to hard & soft skills subsections:\nHard skills are technical abilities you were taught. For example, programming languages or WordPress.\nSoft skills have to do with your personality. For example, collaboration, time-management, or dependability.\nAlternatively, pick relevant skills and divide them into several subsections like computer skills, marketing skills, languages, and others.\nRemember, don’t list skills that you don’t have, that aren’t relevant for the job, and skills that everybody should have. \nWhy is the skills section necessary on a resume?\nBy listing your key skills, the hiring managers will see straight away that you’re a potential fit, whether they’re looking at your resume via an ATS or manually. It also makes it much easier to tailor your resume to specific jobs. Moreover, having a separate skills section is a quick and easy way to list keywords on your resume. This can give you a head start with ATS systems, since they search for specific keywords. \nCheck out our comprehensive guide on how to write a skills section for your resume?\n\nOptional resume sections\nApart from the standard five resume sections mentioned before, there are other resume sections which are optional. It's important to note that each of these optional sections could be incorporated in one of the standard sections.\nThis is why you should only include an extra section if you feel like you have enough to offer in that particular category. For example, if you speak one language well and only know the basics of a second one, then don’t include an extra languages section. \nWith that being said, adding one or two optional sections to emphasize your qualification for the job can be the icing on a cake. For example, if you work in academia, adding an extra section dedicated to your publications or references is going to catch the eye of a recruiter in an instant!\nSo, which optional resume sections are we talking about? \nAchievements and awards\nCertifications and licences\nLanguage skills\nPublications\nReferences\nHobbies\nSocial media\nVolunteering\nCustom sections\nLet's talk about each one in more details.\nAchievements and awards section\nIf you feel like you have enough content for this section then it will definitely help you stand out. But bear in mind – your achievements should be scattered through your entire resume, especially in the professional summary and work experience section.\nIf you decide to dedicate an entire section to your awards and achievements, make sure you prioritize the ones relevant to the job. Also, pick the most noteworthy ones.\nHere’s what kind of accomplishments you can include:\nAwards for specific academic activities or subjects (e.g. Prize for Excellence in Level 2000 Chemistry)\nAwards from professional associations (e.g. CSS Design Award)\nAwards like Salesperson of the Year, Employee of the Year, or Best Performer\nFor more, check out our comprehensive guide: Awards and Achievements on a Resume\nCertifications and licenses\nA certification is basically a proof that you have specific expertise and skills. \nIs it a good idea to include a specific section for certifications on your resume? If you have various certifications that are important and relevant for the desired job – Yes! It shows your willingness to learn and the desire for personal growth. \nHere’s how to include certificates on your resume:\nList your certificates in reverse chronological order, beginning with the most recent one.\nInclude the name of each certification, authority, its URL or code, and any relevant dates.\nAdd the location in case your certificate is state specific.\nDescribe each certificate in more detail. Explain what it entails.\nLanguages\nYou can either include languages as a subsection in hard skills, or you can create a separate resume section only for languages. \nOnly do the latter if speaking a specific language is a key part of the job, or if speaking many different languages will help you get the job.\nList the languages using a single language proficiency scale. Rather than using charts to describe your proficiency level, use words – charts may not register on ATS.\nFor more detail, check out this article: How to List Language Skills on Resume (w/ Proficiency Levels & Examples)\n\nChristy's word of advice\nSometimes, people get too creative with the headings and it may be a disaster because ATS systems look for specific keywords like education, work history, etc. For instance, I’ve seen someone replace a Professional summary headline with the word “Snapshot”. It sounds great! But the ATS doesn’t know what that means, therefore it doesn’t know how to categorize it. I recommend to stick to the standard!\nChristy Morgan, Resident HR Expert\nPublications\nIf you work in academia or in a science field, having your research published is a great achievement. If you have multiple publications it may be a good idea to have a separate section for them in your resume. \nThe important thing here is to correctly format the information about the publication – i.e. make sure to correctly use the common citations styles (Harvard, APA, MLA, etc.). Choose one depending on the author’s preference or according to the discipline (e.g. APA style is commonly used in Psychology field).\nReferences\nIncluding references on your resume is not a common practice anymore. However, in some situations it is acceptable to include references. This is when:\nYour reference is someone well-known in the field;\nYou’re a fresh graduate;\nThe job listing specifically asks you to include references on your resume.\nHobbies\nPeople tend to view the hobbies section as a redundant \"filler\". While this may be true in some cases, it can also be quite useful. Here’s why:\nMany companies nowadays look for candidates who will not only be good at their job, but they’ll also be a good fit for the company culture. It shows you as a real person rather than just an employee. Moreover, it's a good conversation starter for your job interview.\nSo, if you do decide to add the hobbies section, make sure to be really specific. For example, rather than \"Reading\", say \"Historical fiction novel lover\".\nCheck out this guide to find out more about how to list hobbies on a resume.\nSocial media\nHiring managers will google you at one point or another. Be one step ahead and use it to your advantage. Include the social media you want them to see. Creating a separate social media section can be a great way to do that.\nIncluding LinkedIn is always a good idea, since it can serve as an extension to your resume. Make sure to also include any online portfolios, personal websites, or even your Instagram if you work in a creative field.\nRemember, your social media can also prevent you from getting a job. So ensure that your social media presence is polished and sophisticated. \nIf you decide to only include 1-2 social media profiles, you can fit it in your personal information section.  \nFind out more about how to include social media on a resume. \nVolunteering\nAdding a volunteering section on a resume can really help you stand out. It shows your skills, your motivation and that you take initiative. And hiring managers love that. It's also helpful to include a volunteering section if you have limited professional work experience. \nThis also means that if you have plenty to offer in the work experience section, don’t include volunteering at the expense of leaving out important content. \nInclude:\nName of the organisation;\nDuration;\nYour job title/position;\nExplain what you did and what you achieved.\nFor more information, check out this article: How to Include Volunteer Experience on a Resume.\nCustom sections\nYou can add a custom section to you resume if you'd like to emphasize any accomplishments which wouldn’t fit to any of the conventional categories usually found on a CV. \nFor example, if you’re a programmer you can create a \"Custom projects\" section in which you detail your work. If you’re a copywriter or a journalist, you can make a \"Media I wrote for\" section. If you’re a scientist, create a \"Laboratory skills\" section on your resume.\nAlmost every industry has a potential for a custom section that is distinctive to that discipline. \n\nHow to organize your resume sections?\nThe final step in creating a perfect resume is to organize your sections in the right way.\nThe Personal information section and resume summary or objective should always come first. However, depending on where you are in your career, you may want to organize your resume differently.\nHere’s an ideal resume composition suggested by our in-house HR expert for various career situations:\nOrder for students or fresh graduates:\nPersonal information\nResume summary/objective\nEducation\nWork experience\nSkills\nVolunteering and other optional sections\nOrder for experienced professionals:\nPersonal information\nResume summary\nKey professional skills\nWork experience\nEducation\nCertifications, technical skills, and other optional sections\nOrder for career changers:\nPersonal information\nResume summary/objective\nSkills\nWork experience\nEducation\nOther optional sections\nAwards, skills, certificates?\nCreate a strong resume and score your dream job.\nCreate resume\n\nUp to speed with organizing your resume sections effectively?

The age-old question. In English-speaking countries, which also happen to be some of the biggest job markets in the world, including a photo on your resume isn't a good idea. \nHowever, whether you include a photo on your resume or not has a lot to do with your location and industry.\nA resume photo is still a must in many parts of the world. Plus, there are also industries in which including a picture on a resume is desirable.\nSo, to help you make an informed decision about YOUR resume picture, we clarify when exactly you should and shouldn't add a resume photo and include advice from a professional photographer and our resident HR expert. \nWe'll also show you examples of resumes with a photo and professional templates to use. \nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nWhy you shouldn't put a picture on your resume\nWhen you should put a picture on your resume\nCountries to include or exclude a resume picture\nResume photo tips from a professional photographer\nHow and where to add photo in resume\nResume templates with pictures\nKey takeaways: Resume picture\nWhy you shouldn't put a picture on your resume\nIn English-speaking countries, including the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa, adding a picture to your resume isn't a good move. \n\nWhy? \nHere are the 3 key reasons:\n1. Picture on a resume might cause discrimination\nThe clear anti-discrimination laws in these countries are the main grounds for the decision not to include pictures on resumes.\nEmployers must be able to prove that there's no profiling based on factors like ethnicity, gender, age, attractiveness, home address, etc. during the recruitment of employees. \nSo, they prefer to receive resumes without photos as a precautionary measure to ensure no applicant is subject to prejudice. \nIt’s not always the recruiter’s fault, though. They might discriminate unconsciously. Humans are visual beings and we instinctively make judgments about people based on their looks. Even if we’re not aware of it. \nHence, in the job market where people should stand out based on their accomplishments and abilities alone, why allow for a chance of being judged based on one’s race or looks? \nBy not including your photo on a resume, you ensure no injustice is happening. \n2. Picture on a resume can come across as unprofessional\nNormally, job seekers in North America, the UK, Ireland, Australia, or New Zealand don't include a photo of themselves on their resumes. \nHence, some hiring managers can consider it odd or unprofessional when they encounter a rare resume with a photo at the top and it may be perceived as a diversion from what's really important: your work experience, education, and skills.\nWe get that you want to do something that makes you stand out amongst other job applicants, but this could make you stand out in a completely wrong way. \n3. Resume picture steers the recruiters’ attention away\nDrawing from the previous point, on average hiring managers only spend about 6 seconds scanning your resume for important information. \nTherefore, you have a very limited amount of time to sell your skills and competencies. \nExamining your photo, no matter how good-looking you are, might take their attention away from the important details about your work experience, skills, and achievements.\n4. Bonus: Hiring managers will google you anyway \nMost recruiters today google every job candidate and check their online presence. \nThat means they stumble upon your social media profiles, LinkedIn, or other websites that already include pictures of you. \nThis presents you with two kinds of approaches:\nFirst, you might as well add the photo to your resume because they'll google you anyway.\nOr you can opt NOT to include your photo on the resume. The same reason — they’ll google you anyway. \nYour resume should be, after all, about your skills, education, and experience and not about looks. \n\nPro tip\nHere’s how to clean your online presence:\nGoogle yourself, first.\nRemove any controversial content.\nIncluding: drunk party photos, intimate photos, or offensive pictures.\nMake your social media accounts private.\nWhen you should put a picture on your resume\nOn the other hand, there are cases when a resume picture is expected or even required. \nThese are mostly related to the country where you're applying for a job or the specific occupation. \nLet's talk about that in some more detail. \nDisclaimer: When you do decide to include a photo on your resume, please follow the tips from a professional photographer. These are listed in a separate section below. \n\n1. Some countries prefer a picture on a resume\nIncluding a photo on a resume is actually very common in some parts of the world, such as a big part of continental Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  \nFor instance, Chinese employers see a photograph as the norm since first impressions are vital in Chinese culture. \nIn Japan, a resume without a photo can even be discarded altogether. \nSouth Korea also used to be a strong advocate for a resume with photo, although in recent years it's been steering away from this practice. \nIn Denmark (similarly to a big chunk of continental Europe), a photo is usually added to a CV and the majority of employers consider it as a way to 'meet' the candidates.\nIn other countries, such as India, Germany, or Sweden, a picture on resume is a bit of a grey area with advocates on both sides:  \nFor instance, India Daily claims that “your photo on a resume should be strictly avoided”, while a guide to the Indian resume format says it “often adds a much-needed layer of authenticity.” Therefore, we advise you to research the company thoroughly or make a direct inquiry regarding whether you should or shouldn't include one. \nIn Germany, even though it's common practice to add a picture to a CV, many companies will actually advise you not to add photos. All in all, it again depends on the specific company and its practices. Plus, The Berlin Life concludes that not including one isn't going to prevent you from getting a job in Germany. \nSimilar thing is true for Sweden and Netherlands where no clear-cut practices are in place for resume pictures and you won't be treated unfairly either way. \nHowever, there are exceptions within these parts of the world as well, such as South Africa in the African continent and Mexico in Latin America.\nIn a separate section below we include a list of countries and whether or not should you include your picture in your resume there. \n2. Some jobs prefer a picture on a resume\nDoes your appearance bring any value to the job you’re applying for? Because whether we like it or not, looks are important for some occupations. \nThere are plenty of positions and industries where looks matter, including:\nModeling\nActing \nEntertainment industry in general\nBrand ambassador/representative\nReal estate\nSales\nSpokesperson\nYou have to consider for which job positions it’s relevant and for which it's not. \n\nPro tip\nWhen there’s no legitimate reason why looking good might be an asset to the job, you don’t need to include it.\n3. Bonus: It can help you stand out \nWhile resume photos aren't common in many predominantly anglophone countries, they're usually not forbidden. \nThis means that in a pile of text-only resumes, a resume with a photo will stand out and draw attention to itself. \nFor instance, Tobi — a job seeker in Canada — decided to change his approach after 7 rejections from his dream job at Shopify. Among the things he changed was including a photo on his resume even though it isn't advised in Canada. After being rejected so many times, he then finally got the job. \nIn the end, it's up to the HR manager whether it's the right or wrong kind of attention when they see a resume picture. It can, at times, turn out to be a win. \nHere's what our resident HR expert Christy has to say:\n\nResume picture: Expert advice\nIn many English-speaking countries, photos should NOT be included on your resume (e.g. USA, UK, Canada, Australia, NZ). This is to avoid potential bias or discrimination, and ATS will remove it anyway from your candidate profile. However, things are done very differently in other countries, where a photo IS expected (e.g. Scandinavia, much of Europe and Asia). While recruiters can of course check out your image on LinkedIn or social media, I advise you to follow the conventions of the country you’re applying to, to show that you understand local application practices.\nChristy Morgan, Resident HR Expert\nCountries to include or exclude a resume picture\nAs mentioned before, in continental Europe, for instance, it’s a common practice to put photos on CVs. \nHowever, in other parts of the world such as Australia, the US, or the UK, the hiring managers can view the same practice as inappropriate. \nSo, even with the best of intentions, a photo can eventually work against you.\nHere’s a list of countries and continents where you should and shouldn’t include a photo in your resume: \nAfrica: yes (except South Africa) \nAmericas:\nCanada: no \nUnited States: no \nLatin America: yes (except Mexico)\nAustralia and New Zealand: no\nAsia: yes (except Russia)\nEurope:\nAustria: yes\nBelgium: no\nCroatia: depends\nCzech Republic: no\nDenmark: yes\nEstonia: no\nFinland: yes\nFrance: yes\nGermany: depends\nHungary: depends\nIreland: no\nItaly: yes\nNetherlands: depends\nPoland: yes\nPortugal: yes\nRomania: yes\nSlovakia: depends\nSpain: depends\nSweden: depends\nSwitzerland: yes\nUK: no\nWhen you stumble upon “depends”, we advise you to research the specific company or ask directly what are their preferences are for resume photos. \n\nResume photo tips from a professional photographer\nIf you're already familiar with how to write a resume and you know you're going to add a picture in your resume, our in-house professional photographer Noel Rojo has seven tips that will help guide you in taking the perfect resume picture.\n7 resume photo tips from a professional photographer: \nWear a professional outfit. You want to make sure you wear clothes with solid and contrasting colors, especially because your resume might be converted to B&W. Avoid anything with logos or distracting patterns. \nChoose the right background. When taking a resume head shot, a plain neutral and uncluttered background is usually the way to go. You want to choose a place that won't distract from the main subject matter — you.\nAvoid candid and low-quality images. Like your resume, your picture should be properly curated. \nTake the photo from the right angle and height. Your photo should be taken at eye level and it’s recommended to position your face with a slight shift to the side, as taking the picture straight forward can make your image look like a mug shot. However, nothing wrong with a straightforward picture if you can pull it off.  \nGet the lighting right. If you have the option, the best way to take the photo is under natural light. Artificial lighting can work as well, just make sure you get the lighting even throughout your face to avoid hard contrasts. \nGo for a natural look. Abstain from using too much makeup as it can be distracting. Instead, go for makeup that gives you a natural and neutral look. Your picture shouldn’t be the main focus of your resume. \nCrop your image. You want to crop your photo just below your shoulders and slightly above the head. If you don’t know how far you should be from the camera when taking the resume head shot, a good rule of thumb is for your face to take around 60% of the frame. \nYou can even use an online photo editor to edit your photo so it’s simple and doesn’t distract recruiters from the rest of your resume and most relevant qualifications and accomplishments.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that depending on where you’re applying, what to wear for a resume photo will differ. \nFor example, if your job is strictly professional then a suit is advised. However, if the company is more relaxed, then wearing something more casual is usually the norm. \nHere are examples of good and bad resume pictures:\n\nHow and where to add photo in resume\nHave you decided that adding a picture in your resume is what you want to do but aren't sure how or you're scared it'll mess up the formatting? \nKickresume's resume builder offers already pre-formatted templates for your resume which makes it easy to add a picture without messing up the layout. No offense, MS Word. \nHere's how to add a photo in resume: \nSign up or log in to your Kickresume account (don’t worry, there are free options).\nWhen logged in, on the dashboard scroll down to Your Documents and click on New Resume (or any of the other options, if suitable).\nSelect a resume template that already includes a space for your picture, such as: Bubbles, White, or Sunny.\nClick on Personal Information, enable the photo option, and click Change image. Finally, simply upload the photo from your computer.\nRegarding how to paste your picture on a resume, it’s ideal to place it in the upper left or right corner, as it leaves plenty of room to include your contact information and profile. Some modern resumes also place the picture in the center.\nWhen choosing where to place your resume picture, just keep in mind that you should place it in the top third of your resume. That's what our eyes prefer and what feels the most natural. \nThe resume photo can be rectangular, squared, or a circle. Stay away from other shapes.\nAlso, resumes with pictures are usually submitted in color. Because of this, it’s a good idea to print a copy of your resume in order to verify that it will look good as a hard-copy version. \nHere's an example of a resume with a photo:\n\nResume templates with pictures\nNot all resume templates are created equal, some look good with a resume picture, and others not so much. \nHere are three stunning resume samples with pictures that got the layout just right:\nMobile Developer Resume Example\n\nUse this resume template\nAccenture Software Engineering Team Lead Resume Sample\n\nUse this resume template\nProvisioning Specialist Resume Example\n\nUse this resume template\nOr browse another 1,600+ resume examples by your profession. \nKey takeaways: Resume picture\n\nAll in all, whether or not should you put your picture on your resume depends hugely on the country where you're applying for a job and the industry or occupation.\nIn general, applicants in English-speaking countries shouldn’t include a resume picture, unless the job is in an industry that puts emphasis on appearance. \nOn the other hand, applicants in other parts of the world (in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and big parts of Europe) should include a photo on a resume as it's a common practice here. However, there are exceptions within these parts of the world as well.\nIf you do decide to include a picture on your resume, rather follow the tips from a photographer to ensure your headshot is professional. \nLastly, there are all sorts of designs in Kickresume’s Resume Builder, both with or without a photograph. You can choose one that suits your position and country the best.","URL Slug":"resume-picture:-should-you-put-a-photo-on-your-res"}}]}

Short answer, yes. They are not completely retired yet, and you are better off using one. Sure, it is very niche — but why not increase your chances of standing out and being hired?\nWhy can't I simply print my resume and go about my day, you ask? Because everything that you do or don't do during a job interview, says something about you. Yes, even the resume paper you are turning in. In other words, first impressions matter — a good resume paper is only going to help you.\nWait, so there are multiple types of resume paper? Well, yes. But don't panic. You will find everything you need to know, useful tips, recommendations and quick links here. We know time is money so let's get to it.\nIt's not just a piece of paper.\nExpress your personality with a standout resume.\nCreate resume\nWhen will you need a hard copy of your resume?\nToday, most job applications only require a PDF version of your resume, which means that a hard copy isn’t always necessary. Still, there are scenarios when a physical copy (or copies) of your resume can come handy.\nIt is especially in those situations when you come into personal contact with recruiters or hiring managers:\nCareer and networking fairs. Your resume is the most important item you should bring with you. Make sure to print at least 20-40 copies (depending on the size of the event and the number of companies that you’d like to meet with).\nJob interviews. It isn’t always expected. And yes, they've already read your resume. But it’s good to remind them of your credentials by giving them a copy to have in front of them throughout your conversation. Moreover, it makes you look prepared for anything. Ideally, you should bring about 3 copies of your resume.\nThey may also ask you to mail a physical copy of your resume before you’re invited for your interview. \nIf you want to make a great first impression in all the situations above, using professional resume paper is a way to go.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nWhen will you need a hard copy of your resume?\nBest resume paper - our choice\nColor, weight, material, size, texture — often depends on the job\nWhere to buy resume paper\nWhere to print your resume\nBest resume paper - our choice\nAs you can learn in the following paragraphs, there are many types of resume paper — some of them will suit a certain type of job better than other. This is why it is ultimately up to you to choose from.\nIn any case, we did the research so that you don't have to. This is our winner:\nBest resume paper: Kickresume’s choice\nColor: ivory\nWeight: 32lb\nSize: US letter — 8.5 × 11 inches (US, Canada, SA), A4 — 8.3 × 11.7 inches (everywhere else)\nMaterial: 100% cotton\nTexture: plain\nAnd why do we think it's the best?\nColor: Ivory — immediately stands out in a pile of white resumes\nWeight: 32 lb — firm, durable, will not crease, not see-through\nSize: 8.5 by 11 inches in the US, Canada, South America (A4 everywhere else)\nMaterial: 100% cotton — does not reflect light, great color pay-off\nTexture: Plain — professional, safe and classy\nYou can buy it on Amazon.\nColor, weight, material, size, texture — often depends on the job\nThere are a few parameters which you should consider before choosing your resume paper: color, weight, material, size, texture.\nEven though choosing the best resume paper is subjective to your own personal preference, some jobs requires a specific type of resume paper.\nResume paper color\nGenerally, you should stick to neutrals. Especially different shades of white. White is logically the most used paper color —  text is easily readable, colorful infographics stick out and it's easy to get a hold of.\nBut since it's the standard color, it may seem a bit boring — everyone naturally goes with white paper.\nRemember, the whole resume paper \"science\" is about you making an impression and standing out. This is why going for a slightly different shade can help.\nWe recommend off-white and ivory as go-to colors. Using these instead of white will make your resume immediately stand out in a pile of basic white paper sheets.\nIf you used colored elements in your resume, bear in mind that colors show best on white. Because of that, try to go with the most subtle shade — this will keep it elegant and ensure good color pay-off.\nOther colors such as grey, pastel blue or pink may seem even better at catching the eye. Nevertheless, there is a thin line between standing out and seeming unprofessional.\nColored resume paper can, however, work for people who need to show their creativity (such as designers or people in the arts).\n\nResume paper weight\nWe mean thickness but it's called weight because it refers to how much 500 sheets of paper weigh.\nWith weight it is pretty straight forward. A very thin resume paper is going to seem flimsy. Try going for 32 lb paper, which is slightly thicker than your usual paper.\nIt will not crease in the pile of resumes, it is durable and it is not see-through. In the hands of your potential employer it will feel professional and firm.\nA slightly thinner option is 24 lb. This is still heavier and firmer than your regular printing paper. This is a pretty decent, more affordable option.\nResume paper material\nCotton with the content of 75% or higher. The advantages of high cotton paper include: overall durability, extreme smoothness while having a subtle texture, it does not reflect light. Most importantly colors look great on these!\nSome rather unconventional choices are linen and parchment. One word — overkill. I mean c'mon... Imagine someone walking in with a parchment resume.\nAn interesting choice for someone working in Sustainable Development or Environmental and Conservation Sector is recycled resume paper. This eco-friendly choice is never a mistake.\nResume paper size\nIf you're applying for a job in the North and South America, use a US Letter-sized paper (8.5 by 11 inches).\nHowever, if you're applying for a job anywhere else —  A4 is the standard and we recommend using it. Yes, yes standing out from the crowd and all... But having a different size than A4 will probably just make everybody's lives more difficult.\nDo not experiment with paper sizes, unless your potential employer explicitly requires a different size resume paper.\n\nResume paper texture\nHere we have several acceptable choices. However, in our opinion only one of them is safe (yet classy). Go with plain cotton resume paper texture.\nHere's why: it's a conventional safe choice and it won't feel weird to any potential employer, plus there's zero risk of faulty printing.\nOther options are somewhat unconventional, but that does not mean that they can't work for some people.\nLinen paper bears resemblance to woven fabric. The quality of linen paper ranges from a very subtle finish to a more pronounced one. This type of texture could work for someone who wants to be really extra and is looking for an extra job. Other than that it's just unnecessary.\nLaid paper can look quite elegant thanks to the symmetrical horizontal chain line pattern. However, it's prone to ink smudging and bleeding. We do not recommend taking the risk of ruining your resume.\nGranite paper is usually made of recycled material and is, therefore, an attractive and environmentally sound choice. Again, if you work in Sustainable Development this is going to make a very good first impression.\n\nWhere to buy resume paper\nUsually you should be able to find resume paper at any office supply or stationary retailers such as Office Depot, Costco and Target, or Staples and Ryman (if you shop in the UK).\nHowever, shopping online saves a lot of time and often you have a wider choice of products:\nSouthworth is a very high quality resume paper brand recognised by the National Resume Writers Association. But keep in mind that most of their papers are watermarked. On the other hand, some people may take that as an opportunity to show off a little.\nSouthworth offers a variety of different resume papers — cotton, linen, granite, laid and even ... parchment. All in either white or ivory, and either 24lb or 32lb version (go with 32).\nShop for Southworth resume papers on Amazon or Walmart\n100% Cotton, Ivory, 32 lb, Plain paper — Amazon link\n100% Cotton, Ivory, 24 lb, Plain paper (a cheaper option) — Amazon link, Walmart link\nRecycled, Granite, 24 lb resume paper (an environmetally conscious choice) — Walmart link, Amazon link\n\nWhere to print your resume\nThe most convenient and affordable option for printing on your own resume paper is probably your own printer.\nHowever, be mindful about printing on different textures! Laid and linen textures can make your printer ink bleed — and you don't want your resume ruined.\nIf you don't own a printer — try one in your university campus or your local library. Bear in mind that it can be tricky to print on your own paper on public printers.\nOther options include:\nFedEx Office\nStaples Cloud Printing\nOfficeDepot\nIf you want to support local businesses — try finding a Copy and Print shop near you by typing: \"copy print shop [zip code]\"\n\nChristy's word of advice\nThere are times when a printed resume is needed or at least strongly recommended. It’s a good idea to take a copy with you to an interview, in case you need to refer to a specific point, or the recruiter doesn’t have a copy. Or if a company asks you to drop off your resume in person or by post. In these cases, clean white A4 paper will always come across as professional. On the other hand, if you’re in a creative field where visual design skills are important, feel free to channel your inner Warhol and go with something that matches your professional personality (at a company I used to work at, a graphic designer presented theirs in an A6 pack-of-cards format. Brilliant, original, and still memorable many years later!).\nChristy Morgan, Resident HR Expert\nKey takeaways\nIt may seem like a waste of time and money to speculate about resume paper nowadays.\nBut the truth is, we live in a very competitive environment. Even if you're extremely competent, there's probably someone just as competent as you.\nThis is why you should increase your chances of being hired in any way possible. A high quality resume paper can help you stand out and make a good impression — it shows that you put in the little extra work.\nAnyway, just to summarize, our recommendation is stick to neutral colors (ivory, off-white) or go for a more unconventional color if you work in a creative field. Try a heavier 32 lb paper for a firm grip, or go for slightly thinner and more affordable 24 lb version.\nWhen it comes to textures and material — moderation is key. The 100% cotton material and plain texture ensures high quality printing. You can also try recycled paper if it's relevant to the job you're applying for.\nConcluding thought — all things covered in this article are irrelevant if the actual content of your CV isn't as exciting as the resume paper."}}]}

But that leaves relatively little space for text and a lot of white space. Additionally, US letter paper size is a bit different than A4 paper that is commonly used in Europe. Because of these reasons, the 1 inch (2.54 cm) rule is far from universal or internationally accepted. \nThat's why our resume builder offers resume templates tailored for both US letter and A4 paper sizes, with margins that strike the balance just right. These were carefully chosen by professional typographers and approved by HR experts to create the perfect resume hassle-free and quickly:\nUS letter.

For A4 sized paper we set margins at 1.6 cm (0.63 inch) on the left side, 1.3 cm (0.51 inch) on the right, 1.3 cm (0.51 inch) at the top and 1.7 cm (0.67 inch) on the bottom.\nHave a look at some resume templates that got the margin size balance just right.\n\nStandard resume margins\nAs I've already mentioned, it’s often recommended to use the standard resume margin size guidelines when building your resume. This means leaving margins at 1 inch, or 2.54 cm, on each side of your resume — top, bottom and sides.\nBut is this still relevant nowadays? \nFirstly, it's a waste of space. Secondly, you want your resume to stand out. This is why there’s more flexibility with the margin sizes than you might think.\nSo, how and why can you adjust the margins for a resume? And when you should not do it?\nReducing. If you find yourself in a situation where you've crafted a great resume but you’re breaking the one page rule by a few extra lines, reducing the standard 1 inch margin could be the solution. Make sure you’re moving between 0.5 inch and 1 inch (1.3 and 2.54 cm), with 0.5 usually being the lowest you should go. Smaller margins will make your CV seem cluttered.\nIncreasing. This is generally a no-go. Exceeding the 1 inch margins will create more white space than appropriate, leaving your resume seem empty and of little value. In the next section, Creative resume margins, we're going to discuss an exception to this rule.\nKeep the ratio the same. This means that if you decrease the top and bottom margins, you should decrease the side margins too. By doing this, the resume will be more visually appealing and easier to read for the hiring managers. \nPrinting. If you need print versions of your resume, you shouldn’t make the margins too small. As you know, printers randomly act up and you can easily end up with bits of text cut-off from the resume. More details about Best resume margins for printing in a separate section below.\n\nCreative resume margins\nAs mentioned earlier, you can be a bit more liberal with the resume margins size if you've decided to make your resume a bit more creative. Anywhere between 0.5 and 1 inch (1.3 and 2.54 cm) is fine. If your resume is very unconventional, you can even go a little under or over.\nAnd yes, creative resumes can be a hit or miss. Sometimes you can get a bit carried away and end up with something that doesn’t even resemble a resume anymore. And that's bad.\nHowever, if done in moderation, you can somewhat increase the chances of your resume standing out from the pile of standard resumes. So, don’t be afraid of getting a little bit more creative to craft your ideal resume! \nWe can help!\nDon't worry about resume margins. Choose from 35+ pre-designed resume templates.\nCreate resume\nHere are a few instances where having a creative resume can benefit you:\nCreative industry. If you’re applying for a creative position, such as a graphic designer, it’s actually a benefit if you can showcase your creative side this way. \nSmall business. Smaller businesses usually don’t use ATS and your resume is most likely read by a human. They’re also not overwhelmed by piles of applications, hence they have more time on their hands to carefully read each resume. \nPersonal taste. If you know the hiring manager’s personal taste and you’re sure that they’ll like it, why not. \nHere’s an example of Kickresume’s creative template called Bubbles.\n\nHow to change margins on a resume in common text editors\nKnowing what the margin size should be and trying to set it up in common text editors can be a tedious process.\nHence, in this section we’ll guide you through the process of changing resume margins in common text editors, step-by-step. \nEditing resume margins in Microsoft Word (2010 version)\nSelect Layout > Margins.\nSelect the margin sizes you want.\nAlternatively, if you want custom margins, follow the path Layout > Margins > Custom margins.\n\nEditing resume margins in Microsoft Word (2003 version)\nFrom the File menu, select Page Setup.\nSelect the Margins tab.\nIn the Margins section, adjust the margins as needed.\nClick OK.\nEditing resume margins in Google Docs\nClick File from the menu and choose Page setup.\nEnter the measurements in the boxes under the Margins column for Top, Bottom, Left, and Right.\nClick OK to apply the margin changes. \n\nEditing resume margins in WordPad\nClick File, and then Page setup.\nOn the Page setup window, you can set the Left, Right, Top, and Bottom margins.\nClick the OK button to set the selected margins.\n\nEditing resume margins in Apache OpenOffice\n Right-click anywhere on the page and select Page from the pop-up menu.\nOn the Page page of the dialog, type the required distances in the Margins boxes.\nAlternatively, the shaded sections of the rulers are the margins. Put the mouse cursor over the line between the gray and white sections. The pointer turns into a double-headed arrow.\nHold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse to move the margin.\n\nHow to format a resume for better readability?\nOk, you got your resume margins just right. But what else can you do to improve your resume's readability?\nText alignment. The most naturally appealing text alignment for the (Western) human eye is alignment to the left. This is because when it's time to move on to the following line of text, the eye naturally returns to the left margin. Furthermore, if you want to visually separate a block of text, such as a date or a location, you should align them to the right. \nFont style/size. Choose a simple typeface that isn't too over the top. The font size should be between 10 and 12 points. Don’t forget to keep everything the same size, except maybe your name and headlines. Also, mix two typefaces at most.\nResume length. The age old dispute between a one page resume vs. two page resume. The outcome of this debate is, however, not so straightforward. Generally, if you're a fresh graduate or you don't have tons of experience, opt for a single page resume. Conversely, if you're an experienced professional, your resume should be longer. Just make sure to fill it with relevant content. \nBullet points. Bullet points are a must. Just remember to keep them brief and informative. Keep the formatting of bullet points consistent throughout the resume. Align them to the left, don't leave a big indent, keep spacing consistent. \nSpacing. Keep the resume line spacing between 1.0 - 1.5 points. This is both visually appealing and comfortable to read. What's more, it allows you to fit more text on the page. The same goes for paragraphs. Ensure the paragraph spacing is consistent throughout the resume.\nBolding. Writing relevant keywords or company names in bold can improve readability as well as help convey a message. However, try not to go overboard. If you do, it can have the exact opposite effect and make it hard for the reader to concentrate on the important bits. \nIf you're still wondering about how to write a resume, check out our comprehensive guide: How to Write a Resume: The Only Resume Guide You’ll Need in 2021\n\nChristy's word of advice\nThe goal with margins is to ensure your resume has enough white space to make it easy to read while not looking like a block of text. You also want to make sure the text can be printed off in its entirety if a recruiter is looking for some bedtime reading. In general, your margin can be .5, .75, or 1 inch. If you’re at the junior end of your career with less text to display, the margin can be bigger. More text, smaller margin. Play around to see what works best for your particular resume.\nChristy Morgan, Resident HR Expert\nBest resume margins for printing\nWe all know printers can be a bit finicky at times. The best tip we have to offer is to make sure you check \"fit to page\" field on the print dialog.\nSecondly, make sure you know what paper size you need. Whether it's A4 or US Letter, let the printer know.\nLastly, the type of resume paper you're using matters too. If you thought regular printer paper is suitable for printing your resume on, you're wrong. It's too thin and it creases easily. Instead, opt for a slightly thicker, off-white/ivory paper.\nFYI, printing your resume out isn't obsolete and you should make sure you have a few hard copies on hand. These are some of the situations requiring a printed resume:\nJob interview. Bring a copy of your resume with you so that both you and the interviewer can have it in front of them throughout the conversation. It’ll make you look prepared and professional. \nCareer fairs. Bring some copies with you to hand out and save you the time of awkwardly asking people for their emails and them forgetting you by the time you leave. It's great for networking. \nEmailing a copy. Some interviewers may ask you to mail a physical copy of your resume before you’re invited for your interview.","URL Slug":"resume-margins:-how-to-get-them-right-(+resume-for","Meta Description":"Learn how to Resume Margins: How to Get Them Right (+Resume Format Templates) and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

Within seconds, these headings determine if a recruiter will continue reading or set your resume aside.\nThe right headings make a resume easily skimmable, enabling hiring managers to swiftly pinpoint the information they're seeking.\nBut here's a critical aspect to consider: In the digital age of recruitment, using improper or unconventional headings can lead to a resume being overlooked by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).\nThese digital systems scan resumes for specific terms and structures, and if your headings don't align, your application might not even reach human eyes.\nIn this guide, we'll delve into the world of resume headings. We'll explore their significance, the dos and don'ts, and the nuances that can set your application apart.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nWhy care about resume headings?\nWhat headings should be included in a resume?\nOther resume headings to include (or not)\nResume headings format\nResume headings template\nKey takeaways: Resume headings\nWhy care about resume headings?\nResume headings are the chapter titles of your professional narrative. They break your story into digestible sections, guiding recruiters through qualifications, experiences, skills. and more.\nWith them, your resume is structured and easy to navigate, ensuring key points stand out.\nYet, it's not just about human readability. Companies often rely on Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to scan and sort resumes. These systems hunt for specific keywords, especially in headings.\nIf your headings are unconventional, you risk the ATS overlooking your resume. And that means a recruiter might never see your application.\nNow, while it's tempting to get creative, standard headings have stood the test of time for a reason. Everyone recognizes them, making your resume instantly clear.\nBut that doesn't mean you can't sprinkle in a touch of originality. The trick is to add flair without straying too far from what's expected.\nIn a nutshell, resume headings ensure recruiters can easily read your story and that ATS recognizes it too.\nIs your resume ATS-ready?\nHeadings can make all the difference. Start crafting with our resume builder now.\nCreate resume\nWhat headings should be included in a resume?\nNavigating the world of resumes, there are some standard, non-negotiable resume sections you'll come across:\nPersonal Information\nResume Summary or Objective\nWork Experience\nEducation\nSkills\nThese sections form the backbone of any solid resume. However, how you label these resume categories can shape a recruiter's first impression.\nIn the following chapters, we'll look at the resume headings for each of these standard sections, highlighting the most effective headings to use, and those best avoided.\n1. Personal information\nThis section offers recruiters a quick way to contact you. It forms the header of your resume and typically includes your name, phone number, email, and sometimes a location or professional profile link (most often it's LinkedIn).\nLet's look at the good and bad headings for this resume section.\nGood choices:\nContact Information. Direct and clear, this heading lets recruiters know exactly where to find your phone number, email, and address.\nPersonal Information. Just a variation of the above. Still good and to the point.\nPersonal Details. Slightly broader, this can encompass the above plus additional info like a LinkedIn profile.\nBad choices:\nAbout Me. Too vague; it sounds more like a bio or personal statement than a section with contact details.\nPersonal Data. This can sound too technical or as if it contains sensitive information.\n\n2. Resume Summary\nYour Resume Summary offers a succinct showcase of your professional achievements and skills. In 3-4 lines (or 4-5 sentences) a resume summary details your experience across industries and highlights your key skills and achievements.\nOften, it's mixed up with a Resume Objective. However, they serve distinct purposes, and we'll dive into the \"Resume Objective\" in the subsequent section.\nTo avoid any confusion about what this resume section is, choosing the right heading is key. Let's have a look at some effective heading options:\nGood headings:\nResume Summary. A brief overview of your career accomplishments and significant skills.\nResume Statement. Another way to present a concise summary of your professional journey.\nCareer Summary. Focuses on the pivotal moments and primary skills in your career journey.\nAvoid using:\nSummary of Me. Oh, are we at a coffee shop chatting about life?\nWhat I've Done. A bit mysterious, isn't it? This isn't a thriller novel.\nMy Career Story. Sounds like a bedtime story, but we're aiming to wake up the recruiter with your qualifications!\n\n3. Resume Objective\n\nYour Resume Objective is the little window into your career aspirations. In a few sentences, it reveals your future goals, motivations, and why you're pursuing a specific role or industry. This section is especially valuable for new grads, career changers, or those re-entering the workforce.\nMany confuse it with a \"Resume Summary.\" But remember, while a summary showcases your past, an objective reveals your aspirations.\nLet's make sure your ambitions aren't lost in translation. Picking the right heading can make all the difference. Here are some ideal choices:\nGood headings:\nResume Objective (or simply Objective). Direct and clear, it indicates your forward-focused career intentions.\nCareer Objective. A glimpse into the direction you're aiming for in your professional journey.\nResume Profile (or simply Profile). Describes where you currently stand in your career path and outlines your aspirations.\nAvoid using:\nDream Job Wish List. A resume isn't a letter to Santa.\nWhat I Want in Life. Perhaps a bit too existential for a job application.\nHopes and Dreams. Your career aspirations are important, but let's keep it a tad more professional.\n\n4. Work Experience\nThe Work Experience is the heart of your resume, painting a vivid picture of your roles, accomplishments, and the value you brought to previous employers.\nHowever, even here, the heading plays a pivotal role. A clear, professional heading ensures recruiters know exactly where to find the details of your professional history.\nGood headings:\nWork Experience. The most common headline for this section. No frills. It just works.\nEmployment History. A chronological emphasis, laying out the sequence of your roles.\nProfessional Experience. A touch of formality, focusing on your professional journey.\nAvoid using:\nJobs I've Done. Sounds more like a chore list than a professional record.\nPlaces I Worked At. Too casual; this isn't a travel diary.\nMy Work Adventures. Sure, work can be an adventure, but maybe not the best way to put it on a resume.\n\n5. Education\nAs you advance in your career, the Education section may take a backseat to your work experience. However, in fields like academia, law, and medicine, your educational credentials remain paramount throughout your career.\nAnd for instance for fresh graduates, this section often forms the focus point of the resume.\nRegardless of its placement or emphasis on your resume, the heading you choose for this section is vital in setting the right tone.\nGood headings:\nEducation. Classic and straightforward. It's universally understood.\nEducational Background. Comprehensive and clear; it speaks of your academic journey from start to finish.\nAcademic Qualifications. Puts emphasis on formal certifications and degrees.\nAvoid using:\nWhere I Studied. Not a mystery novel's title.\nLearning Journey. Perfect for a memoir, less so for a resume.\nSchooling Adventures. Unless you studied at Hogwarts, perhaps keep \"adventures\" out of it.\n\n6. Skills\nWhether you're flaunting technical know-how, soft skills, or a mix of both, the Skills section can make or break impressions.\nEspecially when shifting industries or roles, your skills can be the golden ticket. But, as always, a fitting headline is the gateway to this treasure.\nGood headings:\nSkills. The simplest choice, and sometimes simplicity is best.\nProfessional Skills. Focused, crisp, and clear; it gets straight to the point.\nStrengths. A reflection of both your innate talents and honed skills that differentiate you.\nAvoid using:\nThings I Can Do. Sounds like a magic trick introduction, doesn't it?\nMy Toolkit. We're not assembling furniture here.\nStuff I've Learned. A tad informal; let's keep it professional.\n\nOther resume headings to include (or not)\nAs you continue refining your resume, consider adding supplementary sections that can present a more comprehensive profile of who you are, both professionally and personally.\nThese optional sections can help diversify your application, showcasing unique attributes or experiences that standard categories may miss.\nWhen deciding to include any of these, ensure they're relevant and can genuinely enrich your resume.\nHere's a short rundown of resume headings you might consider adding to make your application stand out:\nAchievements and Awards\nGood headlines: Awards, Achievements, Achievements & Awards\nAvoid: Things I Won, Praises & Badges, Accolades\nCertifications and Licences\nGood headlines: Certifications, Professional Licences, Courses\nAvoid: Extra Certs, Other Papers I Have\nPublications\nGood headlines: Publications, Published Works, Articles & Papers\nAvoid: Stuff I Wrote, Things I Published\nReferences\nGood headlines: Professional References, References, Recommendations\nAvoid: People Who Like Me, My Recommenders\nHobbies\nGood headlines: Interests, Hobbies\nAvoid: Things I Do for Fun, My Play Time\nSocial Media\nGood headlines: Social Media, Professional Online Presence, Digital Profiles\nAvoid: Where to Find Me Online, My Internet Hangouts\nVolunteering\nGood headlines: Volunteer Experience, Volunteering, Community Service\nAvoid: Places I Helped At, Unpaid Gigs\nResume headings format\nMaking a good resume isn't just about what you write, but also how it looks. How you format your headings can really catch a reader's eye. But also loose them.\nLet's break down how to do this right:\nFont choices. Opt for timeless classics like Arial or Helvetica. Avoid fonts that are too fancy or whimsical; they can detract from your resume's seriousness.\nSize. Consider a size that is larger than the body text but doesn't overshadow the content. For most fonts, this often means 1-2 points larger than the main text, but ensure it's visually balanced.\nCapitalization. When dealing with multi-word headings, you have a choice. Title Case (Where Each Word Begins with a Capital) is a popular choice, making each word distinct. On the other hand, Sentence case (Only the first word capitalized) offers a modern, streamlined appearance. Whichever you choose, ensure you're consistent.\nConsistency. Whether it's the font, size, capitalization, or any other stylistic choice, ensure that you use the same format across all headings. Uniformity enhances readability and imparts a professional touch to your resume.\nResume headings template\nSeeing is often believing. Sometimes, a single picture can explain more than pages of detailed descriptions.\nBelow, you'll find a visual example of a resume, highlighting well-formatted and neat resume headings. Here's what we like about it:\nSimple and standard headings. Nothing crazy, just the tried and tested classics.\nSentence case capitalisation. When there's multiple headings, it simply looks neater.\nFont size and color. A slightly bigger size and the blue color nicely separate the headings from the rest of the text and add a nice touch.\nBusiness Development Manager at Apple Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nThis resume was crafted using Kickresume's online resume builder. If you want to create a stunning resume in minutes, tools like Kickresume can be a game-changer.\nKey takeaways: Resume headings\nWith the prevalence of ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) in the recruitment process, headings play a crucial role in ensuring your resume doesn't get sidelined.\nThese systems rely heavily on recognizable headings to parse and categorize information efficiently.\nHence, the key thing to remember is that while creativity can set you apart in many areas of a resume, when it comes to headings, it's best to stick to the tried and tested, simple forms. For example:\nYes: \"Education\"\nNo: \"Where I Studied\"\nChoose your headings wisely and set the stage for a resume that resonates and gets results.\nAnd, if you already have a fantastic LinkedIn profile, you can even convert your LinkedIn profile into resume that is ATS friendly and looks stunning.

Depending on your career path, there's a lot more that can (and should) be included in this section.\nWhile the principle of 'less is more' often rings true, you also don't want to leave out a crucial detail a recruiter might hope to find.\nYour header serves as a snapshot of your identity, providing immediate access to your essential personal and contact information, and sometimes, it even showcases your picture.\nWondering what makes a good header for a resume? Searching for some stellar resume header examples? Or perhaps you are looking for a tool to format the resume header for you? You're in the right spot.\nIn this guide, we'll walk you through crafting a header for your resume that strikes the perfect balance between essential info and simplicity.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nWhat is a resume header and why do you need it?\nWhat to include in a resume header? \nResume header examples\nHow to create a resume header\nFinal formatting tips for resume header\nKey takeaways: resume header\nWhat is a resume header and why do you need it?\nThe resume header is a section right at the top of your resume, which is usually graphically separated from the main content of the resume. It's the first of the resume sections, and it's usually referred to as the contact information section (rather than \"resume header\"). \nIt’s the space where you should include key information like:\nyour name\nemail\naddress\nLinkedIn\nPlus, there are additional things you can add, like your photo, portfolio URL, or social media profiles. But we'll get to that.\nAnd the purpose of the resume header?\nIt’s simple: recruiters receive countless job applications, making it impractical to recall (and store) every applicant's contact information. \nThat's why it's crucial to have this key information prominently displayed on the most vital document: the resume.\nSo, by providing all the necessary information directly on your resume, recruiters will have no trouble getting in touch with you and invite you for an interview.\nGot a LinkedIn profile but no resume?\nThere's no need to write a resume from scratch. Convert your LinkedIn profile into a resume in seconds.\nImport LinkedIn profile\nWhat to include in a resume header? \nWhen crafting the perfect resume header, it's essential to differentiate between the non-negotiables and the optional additions.\nSome elements are universally expected in every resume header, while others can be tailored based on the job, industry, or your personal preference. \nKnowing what to include (and when) can make all the difference in making a lasting impression.\n\nName and surname\nYour name is the cornerstone of your resume header. Make sure it stands out by using a slightly larger or bold font.\nPhone number\nIncluding a phone number is crucial for potential employers or recruiters to reach out. If you're applying internationally, remember to add the correct country prefix.\nThis is a number code that you must add at the beginning of a phone number when dialing from abroad. It represents each country and ensures that the number can be dialed from anywhere in the world. \nHere are examples of country prefixes:\nUS: +1\nUK: +44\nIndia: +91\nList of all country prefixes\nNot using the correct country prefix when dialing internationally may cause the call to fail.\nEmail address\nYour email is another primary method of communication. Opt for a professional-looking email address; that goofy one from your teenage years might not give the best impression.\nMoreover, it's wise not to use your current work email, as its accessibility could change.\nPhysical address\nIncluding your address on a resume isn't a strict requirement anymore. Why?\nYour physical address can offer insights. Employers might have a preference for local candidates or send correspondence through the mail. However, including your home address can also lead to potential biases or discrimination.\nTo avoid potential biases or discrimination, consider listing just the city and state and naming it \"location\" rather than \"home address.\" For example:\nLocation: Brussels, Belgium.\nA full address with a zip code can sometimes be too revealing.\nLinkedIn profile\nIn the digital age, a LinkedIn profile has become almost as standard as a phone number.\nWhen listing your LinkedIn on a resume, here are some tips to keep in mind:\nCustomize your LinkedIn URL to eliminate the random letters and numbers. To do this, navigate to LinkedIn > Me > View Profile > Public profile & URL (on the right pane) > Edit your custom URL.\nUse the condensed version of your LinkedIn URL when adding to your resume by omitting the https://\nAlternatively, you can list only your LinkedIn name and hyperlink it. But if you're aiming for a position in a large corporation and have intel that they utilize an ATS, opt for the concise LinkedIn URL since ATS systems remove hyperlinks.\nEnsure your profile is updated and reflects your current professional status.\nOther social media (optional)\nIncluding social media in your resume can, in many cases, be advantageous and even required.\nHere's a simple guide on when to add (and when not to add) social media to your resume:\nFor everyone: And especially those in the corporate world, always include LinkedIn. It's like an online resume by itself.\nFor small companies or startups: Besides LinkedIn, you can add other socials if they show off your personality (in a professional light).\nFor jobs anchored in social media: If you're a social media manager or something similar, add any profiles where you've done work-related stuff. Make sure they look professional.\nFor creative jobs: Share where your work is. For example, a coder might add their GitHub, and a video creator could add their YouTube link.\nThe key? Only add profiles that make you look good and fit the job you're applying for. We listed the most popular ones in the picture below:\n\nPortfolio (optional)\nHaving a portfolio can be a game-changer, especially if you're in a creative field. It's your visual CV, showing off your skills and accomplishments in real life.\nHow to include your portfolio on your resume:\nURL Method: List the full web address where your portfolio resides. Example: www.myportfolio.com/janedoe in the contact information section.\nName & Hyperlink: Simply write \"Portfolio\" and hyperlink it to your portfolio page. This looks cleaner, but remember, some systems might remove the hyperlink.\nAlways ensure your portfolio is updated, professional, and showcases only your best work.\nProfessional acronyms (optional)\nYour credentials and acronyms are proof of your skills, hard work, and dedication. These can be:\nCertifications: For instance, CPA (Certified Public Accountant) or PMP (Project Management Professional).\nEducational Titles: Such as MBA (Master of Business Administration) or PhD (Doctor of Philosophy).\nIncluding these not only vouches for your qualifications but also sets you apart from other applicants. However, ensure these are relevant to the position you're aiming for and are widely recognized in the industry.\nMiddle name (optional)\nIncorporating your middle name can be a personal preference. Reasons to consider it:\nClarification: If your first and last names are common, a middle name can help distinguish you.\nProfessional Identity: Some may feel their full name conveys more gravitas or formality.\nConsistency: If other professional documents, like publications or certifications, include your middle name, it makes sense to maintain that uniformity in your resume.\nHowever you choose to represent your name, the key is to stay consistent across all professional touchpoints.\nPicture (optional)\nIncluding a photo in your resume is a topic of debate, but here's a quick breakdown:\nCultural norms: In some parts of the world, adding a photo is standard. This includes Asia, Africa, Latin America, and a big part of Europe. However, applicants in English-speaking countries shouldn’t include a resume picture, unless required.\nIndustry-Specific: For roles in entertainment or modeling, photos are often expected.\nBias Concerns: A picture could introduce (un)conscious bias. If unsure, it might be best to omit.\nIf you decide to add one, ensure it's a professional, high-quality shot. Remember, it’s a representation of your personal brand, so make it count!\n\nPro tip:\nTo maximize compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), it’s wise to stick with straightforward titles for the resume header. “Personal Information” or “Contact Information” are time-tested choices. Keep quirky titles like “Something about me” off the table.\nResume header examples\nThere are countless ways to format a resume header. As the saying goes, \"a picture is worth a thousand words.\"\nInstead of delving into heaps of descriptions, let's cut to the chase and provide some visual inspiration.\nNote: The following resumes (including the resume headers) were created using Kickresume's resume builder.\nTraditional resume header\nIdeal for those eyeing corporate roles. This header radiates professionalism and suits environments that value tradition and formality:\n\nCreative resume header\nTailored for design-centric roles. Here, creativity meets functionality, allowing your unique personality to shine through while maintaining clarity:\n\nMinimalistic resume header\nFor those who love all things clean and clutter-free. This style emphasizes a no-fuss approach, focusing solely on the essentials:\n\nResume header with picture\nA more personal touch, commonly used in certain industries and regions. If opting for this, ensure the photo is a professional, high-quality shot that aligns with the job's nature and cultural norms.\nHere's an example:\n\nHow to create a resume header\nCrafting a polished resume header doesn't have to be a Herculean task. With the right tools at your fingertips, you can design a resume header that stands out.\nLet's walk you through two common tools:\nKickresume (resume builder). This platform offers 40+ pre-designed templates where the resume header is already there. You simply select a template that aligns with your desired style and input your details in the designated areas. When logged in, on the dashboard scroll down to Your Documents and click on Create New.\nGoogle Docs (online text editor). The good thing is that if you have a Google account, you can access Google Docs immediately. When in Google Docs, in the selection banner at the top, select Resume. Now you can edit this pre-defined template. However, you only get one template to play with.\nFinal formatting tips for resume header\nNow that you've created your header, let's ensure it's polished to perfection. The right formatting can make your header pop and leave a lasting impression on recruiters. Here are some essential tips to guarantee your header shines:\nUse of color. A dash of color can differentiate you from the crowd. But remember, subtlety is the key. Choose a hue that's professional and complements your resume's overall design.\nUtilizing whitespace. Whitespace isn’t wasted space. It ensures your header doesn’t look cramped and lets each element breathe, enhancing readability.\nMatching header style with the rest of the resume. Cohesiveness is essential. If you've opted for a modern header, ensure the rest of your resume mirrors that vibe. Similarly, a traditional header should be paired with a classic resume layout.\nConsistent font usage. Stick to 1 or 2 fonts for the entire resume. This ensures readability and presents a harmonized look.\nOpt for a clear hierarchy. Your name should be the most prominent, followed by other details in decreasing order of importance. This guides the recruiter's eye naturally through the header.\nKeep it updated. Regularly review your header. Ensure contact information is current, and consider freshening up the design if it feels dated.\nWith these tips in mind, your resume header will not only look professional but will also command the right kind of attention.\nKey takeaways: resume header\nThe resume header is an indispensable section of every application, so getting it right is paramount for making a strong first impression.\nLet's recap the essentials and the options you have to make yours stand out:\nMust-include:\nName and surname\nPhone number (with correct country prefix)\nProfessional email\nLinkedIn URL\nAddress (at least state and city)\nConsider including:\nProfessional acronyms and titles\nMiddle name\nOther relevant social media links\nPortfolio or personal website URL\nPicture (especially if relevant to the job or culturally customary)","URL Slug":"resume-header:-what-to-include,-what-to-skip,-&-ho"}}]}

Here's a chart with a quick overview of each format.\nResume format\nMain focus\nBest for\nOrder of sections\nTip\nChronological\nWork experience\nExperienced professionals\nWork experience\nEducation\nSkills\nInclude details about your achievements using bullet points\nFunctional\nSkills\nRecent graduates, career-changers, after a long gap\nSkills\nWork experience\nEducation\nInclude a career objective\nCombination\nWork experience & skills\nCareer changers, after a short gap, for career growth\nSkills\nWork experience\nEducation\nInclude other sections, such as achievements\nBonus: Resume format for freshers\nEducation\nStudents\nEducation\nSkills\nWork experience\nHighlight coursework/projects relevant for the job\nOverview of the three main resume formats\nChronological resume format \nThe chronological resume format is the most widely used of the bunch. In fact, if you try to think of a traditional resume, you probably think of one written in this format. \nWhat's the main focus of a chronological resume?\nThis format puts the most emphasis on your work experience section, which should form the bulk of your resume. The individual work experiences should be listed in reverse chronological order (from most recent to oldest). Apart from the names and dates, include a list of your tasks, key (quantifiable) accomplishments, and skills/knowledge gained from the job.\nWho is a chronological resume for? \nExperienced professionals who have a steady work history and are looking for another job in the same field. \nThose with no (or few) periods of unemployment. \nThose who want to demonstrate their career growth and highlight their promotions or achievements. \nHere's an example:\nChronological resume template\nThis job seeker has 4+ years of experience in the given industry, making them an experienced professional. The work experience section is the main focus of this resume and apart from the key information about the employer, they also include a list of their tasks, quantifiable achievements, and other accomplishments.\nChronological resume template\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nFunctional resume format\nA functional resume is a lot less common than its chronological counterpart. However, it still has a place in the recruitment process and can be an ideal option for certain people. It's also referred to as a skills based resume, and here's why.\nWhat's the main focus of a functional resume?\nThe functional resume format highlights your relevant and transferable skills and accomplishments, rather than focusing on your chronological work history. The skills section should be placed at the top of your resume and be quite detailed.\nWho is a functional resume for?\nIt's typically used by job seekers who have gaps in their employment history (e.g. when coming back from a leave of absence or maternity leave).\nFor job seekers who are changing careers, or have limited work experience (like recent graduates). \nHere's an example:\nFunctional resume template\nThis is a perfect example of how a functional resume can make up for the lack of work experience. This person is a student, which is why they don't have much work experience.\nHence, the skills section is right at the top of their resume. It's also divided into 3 categories to really highlight their capabilities. The profile section nicely complements it, touching upon some of the transferable skills.\nFunctional resume template\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nCombined resume format\nFinally, this combined resume format (also called a hybrid format) combines several aspects of the chronological and functional resume formats. Thanks to its versatility, it helps you incorporate a variety of sections into a single document.\nWhat's the main focus of a combined resume?\nAs the name suggests, this resume format combines the best of both worlds. It places equal focus on work experience and skills and also engages the reader with a professional summary. It allows you to effectively highlight your diverse skill set and demonstrate it in the work experience section. \nWho is a combined resume for? \nIt's suitable for anyone who has both relevant work experience and skills that they want to emphasize on their resume. \nProfessionals who are transitioning between similar roles or industries may also find this format very effective. \nIt's perfect for those changing careers with transferable skills, such as project management, communication, or leadership, that may be applicable to multiple fields. \nHere's an example:\nCombined resume template\nThis is an exemplary combination resume. Right at the top is a resume summary that engages the reader. The work experience and skills sections form the bulk of this resume and are both very elaborate. Finally, the person also added a volunteering and certificates section as a cherry on top. \nCombination resume template\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nHow to choose the best resume format for you?\nConsider these key things to pick the resume format that best tells your story:\nAre you a seasoned professional looking to stay in the same field? If so, go for a chronological resume. A combined resume is also an option. \nAre you a fresh graduate? Then use a functional resume to highlight any transferable skills you’ve acquired during your studies or internships.\nDo you have less than 2 years of experience? A functional or combined resume are the most suited.\nAre you changing careers? A combination and functional resume formats will produce the best results. \nAre there any gaps in your employment? If the gap is short, opt for a combination resume. If it's longer, a functional resume is the better option. \nLooking to get a promotion or grow your career? A combination or chronological resume will work best. \nFurthermore, think about which sections you’d like to emphasize. Is it your recent work history? Or would you rather emphasize your hard skills? Or both at the same time?\n\nPro tip\nThe modern combination resume is likely to be the most effective resume format to use in 2024, as it allows you to display all of your skills, qualifications, and past work experience. However, the best resume format remains one that best showcases your unique career path and objectives.\nThis flowchart will help you with your decision-making if you're more of a visual person:\n\nHow to organize each resume format?\nEach resume, despite what format it uses, should include a few key resume sections. \nHowever, depending on which resume format you choose, the order and content of those sections will vary. \nWith Kickresume's resume builder, you can re-order your resume sections however you want them. Simply click on Re-order (left from the resume sections) and drag them to the desired order. \nLet's have a look at how to order the sections in each resume format:\nHow is a chronological resume organized?\nContact information. First, include your name, email, location, and LinkedIn profile. \nProfessional summary. Briefly reflect on the most relevant qualifications and experience.\nWork experience. It should be very detailed. Include all key information about employers, dates, your daily tasks, as well as your key accomplishments, quantifiable achievements, and any knowledge/skills acquired.\nEducation. Mention the name of the institution, dates, courses, and relevant projects.\nSkills. Mention your main skills, but there's no need to go into too much detail.\nOptional sections*. These include awards, certifications, references, volunteering, etc.\n*Include any optional sections that are relevant to the job or if it's anything you want to highlight. \nHow is a functional resume organized?\nContact information. Name, email, location, LinkedIn profile, or other relevant socials.\nResume objective. It briefly states your career goals and creates a connection between your skills and abilities and the position you're applying for. \nSkills. Carefully study the job description and think of skills that are desirable. If you have any, list them. In addition to listing the skills, you should also describe how you've used (or gained) them. Some of the best transferable skills to have include conflict resolution, critical thinking, and technical skills.\nWork experience. List the job titles and dates and add a key accomplishment (1 bullet point).\nEducation. Names, dates, courses, and relevant projects.\nOptional sections*. These include awards, certifications, references, volunteering, etc.\n*Include any optional sections that are relevant to the job or if it's anything you want to highlight. \nHow is a combined resume organized?\nContact information. Include your name, email, location, and LinkedIn profile. \nProfessional summary. A concise overview of your experience and accomplishments.\nSkills. Study the job description and try to cherry-pick the most relevant skills. Ideally, divide them into soft & hard skills.\nWork experience. In reverse-chronological order, include all of the key information about the employers, the dates, your daily tasks, key (quantifiable) accomplishments, and any knowledge/skills acquired. You shouldn't be repetitive, so try to vary the language. \nEducation. Mention the name of the institution, dates, courses, and relevant projects.\nOther sections.  You should include another section that highlights your experience or is relevant to the job. These include: awards, certifications, professional references, publications, etc.\nNeed help with writing your resume?\nCreate your resume with AI in seconds thanks to our GPT-4 powered writer.\nCreate resume with AI\nFresher resume format \nAnd what if you're still a student or you're a graduate fresh out of college? Well, then you should prioritize your education section by placing it before work experience. \nIn the education section, make sure to highlight relevant coursework and other projects that demonstrate the skills and attributes the hiring managers are looking for and are relevant for the specific job or internship.\nProvided that you don’t have much professional experience, consider adding a section about volunteer experiences or extracurricular activities that demonstrate your capabilities.\nHere's a sample of a fresher resume format, belonging to a student hired for an internship at Philips:\nFresher resume template\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nTips for how to format any resume\nAdditionally, apart from choosing the right resume format, your overall resume formatting should also meet the standards. \nHere's a brief summary of the resume formatting recommendations:\nUse a standard font. Ensure your resume is easy to read by using a standard font like Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri and a font size of 11 to 12 points. \nUse bullet points. Use bullet points to make your resume easier to scan and highlight important information quickly. \nThink about the margins. Strike a good balance between not leaving too much white space and making your resume seem cluttered. \nKeep it to one-two pages. Unless you have extensive work experience, you should generally aim to keep your resume to one page. \nConsistency is key. In all aspects of your resume, including the spacing, font, margins, etc.\nUse a professional template or layout which helps to structure the information effectively and makes it easy to read. \nHowever, if you don't want to bother with manually formatting your resume, you can opt for a pre-formatted resume template.\nKickresume offers resume templates that were carefully designed by professional typographers and approved by HR experts to create the perfect resume hassle-free and quickly.\nAll templates are already pre-formatted, so you can go directly to filling in the content.\nHave a look at some resume templates that got the formatting just right and got hired by Accenture and Amazon:\nSoftware Engineering Team Lead Resume (hired by Accenture)\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nAmazon Systems Administrator Resume Sample (hired by Amazon)\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nKey takeaways: Choosing the best resume format in 2024\nIn 2024, the modern combination resume may prove to be the most effective resume format as it allows you to highlight your skills, qualifications, and past work experience all at once.\nHowever, the most suitable resume format for you is one that best reflects your individual objectives and career stage.\nYour ultimate goal is to help recruiters extract key information about you as quickly as possible. The resume format is the tool that helps you do that. \nWhat's more, the proper layout of a resume with well-defined individual sections will make your resume look good and professional.\nLet’s recap 3 main points concerning the resume format:\nMake that format choice. Think about things you’re proud of. Is it your extensive work history or a broad array of skills? If it’s a no-brainer, use either a chronological or functional resume. If it's all closely intertwined, go for a combined resume format.\nPut the best parts first. The top one-third of your resume is where the most important stuff is. Whether it’s your skills, work history, or education, make it stand out.\nUse resume templates. These are already pre-formatted for you, and you can re-order the sections simply by dragging."}}]}

Unfortunately, it only hires about four to six thousand candidates.\n\nWith competition so fierce, it might seem impossible to actually score a job at Google.\n\nOn the other hand, the most difficult part is to get invited to an interview. Once you make it that far, at least you have some control over how it's going to go from there.\n\nFor that reason, we're bringing you a resume written by someone who already scored a job at Google. Follow in the footsteps of those who already know the way.\n\nResume Example: Account Executive at Google\nAccount Executive Google Resume Sample\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\n\n\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n\n1. Resume Structure\n2. Contact Information\n3. Profile\n4. Work Experience\n5. Skills\n6. Hobbies\n7. Certificates\n8. Volunteering   \n9. Education\n1. Resume Structure\n\n\nEverybody hates reading through walls of text. Hiring managers are no different.\n\nSo don't waste their time looking for the important information on your resume. Serve it to them straight away! Let them know you understand their priorities.\n\nAlso, let your resume breathe a little. That will allow the hiring manager navigate through it with ease and find the most important information fast.\n\nFinally, you should know that some parts of the resume are fixed, while others will change depending on your particular circumstances.\n\nGoogle, Apple, or SpaceX?\nScore your dream job with a standout resume.\n\nCreate resume\nLike Mary in this resume example, you should always keep the contact information at the top so the hiring manager will be able to contact you.\n\nOther parts of your resume will depend on your level of seniority.\n\nIf you're a fresh graduate, opening your resume with the work experience section is probably not the best idea. Start with education and certificates instead.\n\nYour resume's visual side also plays an important role. Maybe use two different colors or replace words with icons. Just remember to do everything in moderation.\n\n2. Contact Information\nAccount Executive Google Resume Sample\nThe first thing you notice here is her name. It's large a visible and it helps the hiring manager find her resume fast in a pile of others.\n\nRight next to it you can find her email address. Email is the primary way of contacting the applicant. Never forget to include it, otherwise they won't be able to get back to you. Ever.\n\nYou should always provide your phone number as well. When it comes to your physical mailing address, you don't have to include it.\n\nWhat about the photo? Is it necessary? Or not? Depends on the country and company culture. When in doubt, don‘t include it.\n\n3. Profile\nAccount Executive Google Resume Sample\nThe best way to introduce yourself on a resume is through its profile section. This particular resume does it spectacularly.\n\nFirst, it opens by saying who the candidate is professionally.\n\nSecond, using the right keywords (based on the job description), it says what the candidate has to offer to a potential employer.\n\nLastly, it states her expectations. She wants to be an account executive. You can go even deeper and explain why you want the position, what are your expectations, what are you excited about it, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, you might also want to keep it a bit shorter than this resume does. It should be a brief introduction, not a full list of your skills and achievements.\n\nNevertheless, this resume scored a job at Google. Who are we to judge, then?\n\n4. Work Experience\nAccount Executive Google Resume Sample\nYour work experience section is the veritable core of your resume! Because of that, you should put enough effort into writing it.\n\n'Relevant' is the word of the day here. No need to list your bartender experience if you're applying for a dentist job.\n\nStick to the point, like Mary did here. She lists all her duties and daily tasks, summarizing all the details that can resonate with the recruiter.\n\nBut it's not only about the words she uses. Those numbers have even greater impact.\n\n2017 New NA YTY 24.4% growth, including Add Ons 32% growth\n2017 NA Conversion Rate10.4%\n2016 Renewal rate 85%\n2016 NA Signings Quota of 2.2M TCV and 1.9M ACV\nYou might not know what those abbreviations mean but they look good, and anyone from her fields will decipher it in no time. It sends a clear message she's goal oriented and can back it up with numbers.\n\n5. Skills\nAccount Executive Resume Sample\nWhat skills should you mention? Which are redundant? How in-depth should you go?\n\nRule of thumb: List only those relevant skills that are at least somewhat unique to the position. (And which you actually possess.)\n\nAt the same time, avoid using buzzwords. They are the words that have been overused, carry little meaning, and will add nothing to your resume.\n\nIn other words, anybody can say they're 'flexible', 'team player', or 'outside-the-box thinker'. But what does it really mean? And can they prove it? Nobody knows.\n\nSomething similar applies to the skills that are indispensable to the job. If you're a dentist, skills like 'tooth extraction' should go without saying.\n\nInstead, try to draw the hiring manager's attention to the skills you have on top of the expected.\n\n6. Hobbies\nAccount Executive Resume Sample\nIt‘s always nice to let recruiters know you're a human being, too. It makes them think of you in a different way.\n\nMoreover, if it doesn‘t consist only of the boring ones such as books, traveling, sports, you will rock!\n\nBe specific! Don‘t just write sports! Write yoga, CrossFit, and hiking! Instead of traveling, you're exploring different lands!\n\nThe little icons can give it a nice artistic touch, but be careful with them. Sometimes less is more.\n\n7. Certificates\nAccount Executive Google Resume Sample\nIf you have as many certificates as Mary, don't be afraid to brag a little. Show yourself in the best possible light, and tell your future employer how eager you are to learn new things.\n\nNot only did Mary list her certificates, she also took the effort to explain what kind of skills and knowledge she acquired thanks to them. That's much more informative than simply listing the certificate.\n\nBut it‘s not about the quantity only, quality matters, too.\n\nHave you ever done a first aid course and got certified? Great. For your loved ones at or anyone around you. Not for the recruiter, at least for the time being.\n\n8. Volunteering   \nAccount Executive Resume Sample\nEmployers love to see you're active in non-profits and want to make world a better place.\n\nMary‘s volunteer work backs her skill sets – forward thinking, decision making, communication, negotiation, organization. Everything you need for an executive account job at a big tech company.\n\nAnd sports coordinator? Sure, why not! Everybody loves healthy people.\n\n9. Education\nAccount Executive Google Resume Sample\nHave you noticed? Mary‘s education occupies the last spot on the resume, and it‘s the shortest one. What does it say?\n\nIf you're good at what you do, nobody is going to care about your degree — not even giants like Google. (Unless you want to be a nuclear physicist or a medical doctor.)\n\nYour experience, proven skills and certificates say more than those few years in college.\n\nBut all of the above only applies to those who have enough work experience.\n\nIf you're a fresh graduate, you want to put your education section first and make it as extensive as possible.\n\nYour resume can be even better.\nGet a new job with 35+ design resume templates.\n\nCreate resume\nDo you want to score a job at Google, too?

Hence, when you’re competing with hundreds of applicants, creating a QA software tester resume that stands out from the rest is crucial. \nThe truth is, navigating the job market nowadays is difficult in any industry, with only 20% of applicants getting through to an interview round.\nAnd, in a highly competitive industry like QA engineering and testing, it’s especially challenging to stand out.\nThis comprehensive guide to building a QA software tester resume — applicable even if you’re a fresh graduate or a QA software tester with more years of experience — will help you increase your chances of getting an interview. \nPlus, we'll show you an example of a QA tester resume written by a certified professional resume writer that you can use as your first draft.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n1. Let the formatting speak for itself\n2. Start with a strong resume summary\n3. Go beyond just describing your daily tasks\n4. Show off your skills\n5. Make your education relevant\n6. Tailor each resume to each job you’re applying for\nQA software tester resume example\nWhat to do if you have no experience with QA testing\nConclusion\n1. Let the formatting speak for itself\nImagine yourself as a recruiter filtering through hundreds of QA tester applications, all saying the same thing.\nThat's why most recruiters only spend 7 seconds scanning your resume for important information.\nHowever, an excellent resume can convey your level of expertise even with just a cursory glance.\nNow, this doesn’t have to mean crazy graphics or overpromising in your resume summary section. \nInstead, it’s more about organizing your resume’s content in a readable and easily understandable manner, while drawing attention to the right information. \nHere's how you can do that:\n\nWrite your most recent experiences first. Writing in reverse chronological order allows recruiters to see your latest — and often most relevant — work experience before anything else. For example, if you have recently tested a solution for modernizing legacy banking systems, it will be a more impressive experience than your first tests of small apps.\nUse sections and headers. You should strategically place headers where they facilitate the natural flow of reading. Don't scatter them randomly, but rather place them in a way that naturally drags down the reader’s eyes when they read the content.\nKeep it minimal but exciting. The traditional resume format is very simple, with long sentences and basic headings. Your QA tester resume can be much better if it uses graphics (e.g. icons for your contact info or LinkedIn) or strategic color-blocking schemes.\nUse a readable font. Fonts like Roboto and Nunito are good options for your resume because they’re easy on the eyes and great for reading. If you want to do something more unconventional, use Saira.\nTake advantage of reading patterns. Studies have revealed that humans often read in specific patterns (e.g. F-pattern and Z-pattern) depending on how the text is structured. You can take advantage of this in your resume by strategically placing important content where it’s most visible, i.e. the top left. \nMake a separate contact information section. When creating your resume, you should keep your contact info and links immediately visible. That way, a prospective company can easily contact you instead of putting your resume aside.\nWhen creating and posting your resume, remember the rules of internet safety:\ndon't publish your personal address on publicly-accessible domains;\nlink a LinkedIn profile or a business email, rather than a personal one;\nfinally, we don't recommend registering on sketchy job-posting sites.   \n2. Start with a strong resume summary\nYou have limited time to convince recruiters to give you an interview. \nAnd a good resume summary (also referred to as professional summary or profile statement) at the top of your resume is an excellent way to catch the recruiter's attention and let them know what you have to offer. \nIdeally, you should place all your most remarkable achievements here, and make sure to add numbers!\nThis way, the recruiter can quickly determine what makes you worth hiring and how you stand out from the rest. \nExample of a QA software tester resume summary:\nTechnology professional backed up by strong credentials, such as computer science degree from the top-ranked university and CST certification.\nI have multifaceted experience in identifying, analyzing, and documenting software defects on 100+ projects along with extensive analytical skills, attention to detail, and ability to work in a team in fast-paced environments.\n3. Go beyond just describing your daily tasks\nOne of the pitfalls for many QA testing applicants is simply describing their daily tasks at work in the work experience section. \nThe recruiter doesn’t need to know that you \"Made test plans and did automated or manual testing at XYZ company\" — they already know that’s what a QA tester does. \nInstead, go above and beyond to list your achievements at that particular company and quantify your results.\nDid you do anything of note? Did you improve processes? How can you tell your performance is something notable?\nHere are some examples to start you off:\nAccelerated QA testing by 25%, contributing to an additional $1M in company revenue without increasing headcount.\nExecuted test plans and scripts to pinpoint a software bug in the collection system, resulting in a stellar audit finding.\nIdentified key insights that improved team efficiency by 29%.\nNeedless to say, it’s still important to describe what you did at a particular company. However, make sure to illustrate how you excelled in that particular task.\n\n4. Show off your skills\nWhen applying for QA software tester jobs, recruiters seek specific skills. In this industry, these are most often hard skills.\nFor example, an expertise in a particular programming language or a specific QA testing tool like Selenium or Cucumber. \nFurthermore, your skills section is also important because it’s easy to place important keywords from the job ad there. \nRemember, recruiters receive tons of applications, so one way to sort through them is to hand-pick resumes containing the keywords they’re looking for.\nHere are examples of good skills for a QA software tester:\nTest automation\nJira\nSelenium\nTestsigma\nSQL\nJava\nScripting\nQuality Assurance Testing\nCritical Thinking\nAttention to detail\nOf course, make sure that you can actually follow through on your promises. Don’t list a specific software if you don’t know how to use it. \nWant to debug your resume?\nThe AI Resume Checker scans your resume for any errors and then improves it.\nTest your resume\n5. Make your education relevant\nDepending on where you're in your career, the education section may or may not be as important as your work experience or skills.\nStill, in both cases, it does play an excellent supporting role in your overall resume. \nMost people will simply list their school, major, and years of attendance. While doing that is fine, you can take it a step further by aligning your education with the job description. \nYou can add the following in the education section:\nThe organizations you joined\nThe groups you led\nThe projects you excelled at\nCommendations by your professors\nA really high GPA\nLeadership experience\nThis is especially useful for fresh graduates who may need more years of experience to impress recruiters. \n\nPro tip\nThoroughly and extensively completed experience and education sections on resumes affect the hourly rate for software developers and testers.\n6. Tailor each resume to each job you’re applying for\nUp to 54% of job applicants don’t tailor their resumes to each job their applying for — which can be a negative signal to the recruiter and hurt your chances of getting interviewed. \nWhy? Well, in the recruiter’s eyes, you aren’t offering them the best match for what they’re looking for. \nHence, you need to take advantage of the opportunity to add job-related keywords to your resume.\nIn fact, the statistics above also state that 75% of resumes are rejected by the widely-used ATS software — with the likely cause being that those resumes didn't contain relevant information (i.e. no related keywords). \nYou can easily increase your chances of landing the job by aligning your resume with the job description.\nFor example, if the job ad calls for expertise in Selenium, make sure to include that in your resume.\nIf the company wants someone who’s an expert in Java, then highlight that in your work experience. \nTailoring each resume is a lot of work but the results are more than worth it. \nQA software tester resume example\nFinally, to help you tie everything we talked about together:\nThis resume was crafted by a certified professional resume writer specifically for the role of a QA tester.\nThere are several things that make this resume noteworthy:\na strong and effective resume summary is right at the top;\nthere are keywords scattered throughout the resume;\nit includes relevant hard skills;\nit has a sleek design and includes graphic elements (in moderation).\nQA tester resume sample\n\nThis resume sample was written by a certified resume writer specifically for this position.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nIf you're looking for more inspiration, check out our other tester resume samples. Some of them also belong to real people who got hired by companies like TubeBuddy or Aspire Systems.\n\nWhat to do if you have no experience with QA testing\nMuch of our discussion focuses on highlighting your work experiences and skills.\nBut what about fresh graduates who only have brief internships or even no internships at all to speak of? Or, what if you have recently switched careers?\nIt can be daunting to apply for jobs when you have little related experience — but everybody has to start somewhere.\nWhile lying on your resume may seem like an easy way out, it may come back to bite you in the...future when you least expect it. \nFortunately, you have a few options when you’re a fresh graduate but don’t want to leave a gaping hole in your work experience section. \nHere's what to do if you don’t have experience with QA testing yet:\nTake advantage of online resources. You can try out dummy projects online to understand the entire testing process — creating and executing test cases, logging defects, and finalizing testing reports. You can then add these projects to your resume to give it a decent boost.\nLearn from online courses. Apart from learning a thing or two and gaining an official certificate, the projects you’ve worked on for the course can be considered QA experience. If you’ve taken any courses, don’t forget to document your process and highlight them on your resume. \nWork on side projects. One of the best ways to gain testing experience without actually working for a company is working on your own projects! It can be a project with friends, classmates, or even yourself. \nInitiative is never taken for granted, and hiring managers will appreciate your initiative to start your own projects to upskill. \nConclusion\nThe difference between getting an interview and being ignored by recruiters is often decided by an excellent resume.\nWithout it, your skills and abilities take the backseat and won’t get enough spotlight. \nSo, if you find yourself having trouble scoring interviews despite your many years of experience in QA testing, it's probably time to update your resume.\nIt will be worth every bit of your effort.","URL Slug":"qa-software-tester-resume:-6-tips-for-crafting-a-c","Meta Description":"Learn how to QA Software Tester Resume: 6 Tips for Crafting a CV Without Bugs and Errors (+Example) and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

Do you create a separate section? Or\nB. Weave them into existing sections?\n\nA good rule of thumb? If you have three or more projects, consider creating a separate section.\nBoth integrating projects into existing sections and creating a separate section have their merits.\nSteps to list projects in a separate projects section:\nChoose the right title. Opt for titles like \"Projects,\" \"Independent projects,\" or \"Freelance projects\" based on your projects' nature.\nInclude details. Mention your specific role, the outcomes achieved, and any technologies or tools you've used.\nQuantify. Using numbers like \"boosted website traffic by 20%,\" often means more to recruiters.\nInclude URLs. Add a direct link to your project. You can use a hyperlink or provide the full URL. However, be mindful with hyperlinks. Some Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) might strip the hyperlink, leaving only plain text.\nSteps to list projects within an existing resume section:\nIntegration. Incorporate project details into your Work experience or other relevant sections (e.g., Education).\nUse action verbs. Begin with verbs like \"developed,\" \"initiated,\" or \"spearheaded\" for added vigor.\nInclude URLs. If available online, share links to your project, ensuring potential employers can view your work directly.\nConsistency. Ensure your formatting matches the rest of your resume for a unified look.\nWhichever method you opt for, ensure your projects are presented to best highlight your experience and accomplishments.\nProjects on resume examples\nSometimes, it's easier to show rather than tell. To provide a clearer outlook, we provide a few examples to get you started with including projects on your resume.\nBelow is an example of how a separate projects section on a resume might look for someone in the marketing field:\n\nSometimes, blending projects into your work experience offers a better view of your contributions to a particular role.\nHere's an example of how you can seamlessly integrate a significant project within the \"Work Experience\" section:\n\nNote: The following resume examples were created using Kickresume's resume builder.\nFormatting tips for a projects resume section\nIn the world of resumes, presentation matters as much as content.\nA well-formatted projects section can elevate your resume, making it more digestible and engaging for recruiters.\nHere are some formatting tips to ensure your projects section shines:\nUse bullet points. Bullet points break up text, making your achievements easier to skim and digest. It also looks tidier and more organized.\nConsistency in formatting. Whether it's the font, size, or layout, ensure it matches the rest of your resume. Consistency signals professionalism.\nPositioning the projects section. If your projects are highly relevant to the job you're applying for, place this section near the top of your resume. But, if they're more extra, position them towards the end.\nPrioritize your projects. Always lead with your most relevant projects. If you developed a game-changing marketing strategy, it should come before that small side project you did 3 years ago.\nIncluding URLs. When adding URLs to showcase your work, make sure they're neat. You can use hyperlinks, but be careful. Some ATS may strip out hyperlinks, leaving plain text. Always ensure the plain text URL is understandable and doesn't break when the hyperlink is removed.\nRemember, the goal is to make your projects section as readable and impressive as possible, guiding the recruiter's eye to your most noteworthy accomplishments.\nKey takeaways: Projects on resume\nThe job market is as competitive as ever, and standing out is paramount.\nOne sure way to make your resume stand out is to include projects you've worked on in your CV. It adds a little something extra to your resume and provides a real-life look into your skills.\nCreate a separate projects section if you have more than 3 relevant projects to showcase. If not, you can include the projects in other resume sections, like the work experience.\nDon't forget to give the project a clear name, mention what your role was, what the outcome was, and include a URL.\nA projects section can be the x-factor that propels your resume to the top of the pile.

Whether you've been formally trained for the job or you've just been recently promoted, having the right project manager skills in your resume makes all the difference. \nAs a project leader, having expertise in your field is great but not enough. \nYou also need to have specific soft skills to be able to keep everyone else on your team on the same page throughout a project. \nLeadership, communication, and emotional intelligence are just some of the essential skills any project manager should have. \nIn this article, we'll explore the top hard and soft skills that you need in your resume to score a job as a project manager.\nPlus, we'll show you an example of a project manager resume written by a certified professional resume writer that you can use as your first draft.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nWhy you should invest in gaining new skills as a project manager\nTop project manager skills to put on a resume\n1. Problem-solving skills\n2. Tech savviness\n3. Project Management Methodologies (PMMs)\n4. Effective communication\n5. Negotiation\n6. Leadership\n7. Project-specific hard (technical) skills\nProject manager resume example\nWhy you should invest in gaining new skills as a project manager\nFirst things first. Why are your skills so important?\nAs IBM executive Alex Kaplan puts it, skills are the currency of the future. \nIt's easy to see why — your skillset is like a valuable commodity. The more skills and knowledge you have, the more attractive you'll be to potential employers. In a way, it really is an investment.\nThat's why expanding your knowledge and skills is always worth exploring. \nFurthermore, since the start of the pandemic, there's been a shift in the skills employers look for on resumes. \nAccording to a 2021 McKinsey research, more than half of companies now prioritize advanced cognitive skills, such as critical thinking, decision-making, and quantitative skills. \nAnd, since 2019, project management skills have been particularly in demand.\nJust take a look at the infographics below.\nSource: McKinsey & Company\nHence, it's no surprise that project managers are looking to upskill themselves. They need to demonstrate a wide array of social, cognitive, and technical project manager skills to stay ahead of the competition. \nSo, you should do that, too.\nTop project manager skills to put on a resume\nA resume of a modern project manager should display a full range of skills that employers look for nowadays. \nWe'll explore the top 7 project manager skills that are in demand, why they're essential, and how to demonstrate them on your resume. \nHint: Things have changed in the past few years, and so have the requirements for project managers. What worked in 2010 is no longer enough. \n\n1. Problem-solving skills\nProjects often encounter obstacles, delays, and unexpected challenges. \nThat's why project managers must have the ability to quickly spot and resolve any issues that arise to ensure projects get done on time and within budget. \nProblem-solving skills allow you to identify the root cause of an issue, come up with solutions quickly, and move forward with the project.\nIn addition to that, you should be able to communicate effectively and explain your decisions and solutions to the team. Ideally, all while keeping everyone on the team happy. \nHere are 3 examples of how to demonstrate problem-solving skills on your resume:\nCame up with the idea of a cross-departmental team brainstorming session to find solutions to complex company-level problems.\nDeveloped management strategies to resolve employee disputes, resulting in a more cohesive work environment.\nResearched potential solutions to an intricate technical issue, identified the root cause, and devised a permanent fix.\n2. Tech savviness\nIt's predicted that AI will take over 80% of project management tasks by 2030, according to Gartner, a technological research and consulting firm. \nBut don't panic — this doesn't mean that you're going to be replaced. \nInstead, AI will help you by automating mundane tasks, such as data collection, tracking, and reporting. This will give you more time to focus on tasks that AI still can't do. \nHence, project managers need to be tech-savvy and learn to work with AI rather than against it.\nAs a project manager, you'll need to know what tools are out there, how to use them to your and your teams' advantage, and teach your team members to work with them effectively, too.\nHere are 3 examples of how to show you're tech-savvy on your resume:\nApplied AI tools to create streamlined task management systems to improve team productivity.\nImplemented computer vision technology to quickly analyze visual data for quicker decision-making processes.\nDeployed automated chatbots to provide 24/7 support for team members and stakeholders.\n3. Project Management Methodologies (PMMs)\nFirst, what's a project management methodology exactly?\nProject management methodologies (PMMs) are frameworks for organizing, planning, and executing projects. There are many different types, including Agile, Waterfall, Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Six Sigma — and the one you choose depends on the project's size, scope, industry, and objectives.\n\nProject management methodologies (PMMs)\nWaterfall. Waterfall PMM follows a linear approach, where a project phase can’t begin until the previous one is completed.\nAgile. It’s characterized by iterative development, adaptability, continuous improvement, and collaboration between cross-functional teams.\nScrum. Helps self-organizing teams work on more complex projects. It consists of a series of quick daily tasks, short daily meetings, and a leader keeping everyone in check.\nKanban. It emphasizes visualizing the workflow of a project by using boards and other visuals to show the project’s current status and the stage of each phase (e.g. in-progress, completed, to-do lists).\nAs a skilled project manager, you should have at least a basic understanding of these methodologies and, ideally, also experience with implementing one or two of them in the past. \nIncluding them on your resume will make you go from a rookie to a professional mentor to your team.\nHere are 3 examples of how to showcase on your resume that you implemented PMMs: \nDeveloped a new project management system using Agile methodology to reduce project timelines by 25%. \nUtilized Scrum framework to lead teams of up to 10 members to complete projects on time and within budget.\nImplemented Kanban techniques to streamline workflows and maximize efficiency.\n4. Effective communication\nCan you imagine trying to get a project done without effective communication?\nWithout it, team members would have no idea of their roles or the project's objectives, and stakeholders and clients would have no clue about the progress of the project.\nSo, how to demonstrate effective communication on your resume?\nFirst, you can talk about your ability to assess the team dynamics and “tailoring” your communication style to different individuals depending on their position or age. \n\nHow to tailor your communication style depending on someone's position or age?\nPosition: For example, speaking in more detail to team members, summarizing with stakeholders, and being positive and clear with clients. \nAge: When working with Gen Z, you’ll want to keep in mind that they prefer transparent communication. Millennials, on the other hand, tend to respond better to a more upbeat, diplomatic style of communication.\nSecond, as the modern workplace is increasingly relying on remote work and async communication, you can't rely solely on communicating via in-person meetings and emails. \nYou should show on your resume that you can use various online communication tools and software. \nThese are some of the tools that you can mention in your resume skills section:\nInstant messaging: Slack, MS Teams chat\nOnline meetings: Zoom, MS Teams, Google Meet\nFile sharing: OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive\nProject (task) management: Asana, Monday.com, ClickUp \nOther popular project management software include Trello, PlanRadar, Hive, and Microsoft Planner.\nOf course, you don't need to list every single online tool or project management software. Most have similar UX, so familiarity with a few will be enough. \nTip: If there are any specific online tools mentioned in the job ad, include them in your resume.\n5. Negotiation\nProject managers negotiate with stakeholders in all stages of a project. In a sense, they’re the middlemen between customers, clients, team members, senior management, and other partners. \nNegotiation begins when you’re just starting on a project. First, you need to set the project scope and goals. When defining goals and tasks, you need to reach a consensus with multiple stakeholders. \nTo set realistic timelines, for example, you may need to bargain with the team, senior management, or the client. It can involve negotiating with your team and optimizing processes to save time and money.\nOr vice versa, you may also need to ask for a budget expansion from the sponsors.\nAnd ultimately, in any project that involves multiple stakeholders, there’s also a strong chance of conflict. \nBeing a good negotiator comes in very handy in those situations. \nLet's look at examples of how to display negotiation skills on your resume as a project manager:\nNegotiated favorable financial terms with vendors, delivering savings of up to 25% on materials and services.\nAchieved a 35% reduction in operational costs through successful negotiation strategies.\nSecured a $2.5M discount for a multi-year contract renewal, saving the company 30% on the total agreement.\n6. Leadership\nA key part of being a successful project manager is having strong leadership skills. \nA project manager should be able to motivate and guide their team in order to reach project goals. Leadership is also about understanding the limitations of a team and ensuring that tasks are properly allocated, taking into account the individual capabilities of each team member. \nThis often means taking a situational approach to leadership, understanding the different needs of your team, and varying the leadership styles accordingly. \nFor example, some members may welcome a coaching approach, whereas others thrive under democratic or affiliative leadership.\nLet's look at examples of how to display leadership skills on your project manager resume:\nDirected a team of 10 engineers in the development of a new software product, meeting all deadlines and surpassing customer expectations.\nLed the successful training and onboarding of new team members, ensuring adherence to established processes and standards.\nLed a cross-functional team of 15 members in the development of a new product line, which resulted in the launch of a successful product in the market.\n7. Project-specific hard (technical) skills\n\nApart from a variety of soft skills and general leadership skills, you should also have specific technical knowledge in project management.\nThis way, you understand all stages of a project, can weigh in on all aspects of it, and help your team members.\nWhat sort of hard skills you'll need will depend on your industry and the particular company, but here are some examples:\nProgramming: Knowledge of programming languages, such as Python, C++, or Java comes in handy in web development, software engineering, and other IT industries. \nData analysis and visualization: Data analysis is used in many different sectors, including business, logistics, pharma, and finance. Consider learning software like Excel, R, Tableau, or Python.\nMarketing: In marketing, you can demonstrate knowledge of social media marketing, inbound marketing, UX & UI trends, CRM and CMS, and tools like Google Analytics, SEO tools, and WordPress.\nDesign: Project managers in the fields of graphic and UI/UX design should have a basic knowledge of tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, Sketch, InVision, and also UX design tools.\nAnd here's how to showcase hard skills on your project manager resume:\nUtilizing SEO and keyword research to optimize content for search engine visibility. \nProficient in creating clickable prototypes with InVision.\nUtilized R to develop statistical models and generate insights from data sets.\nProject manager resume example\nFinally, to help you tie everything we talked about together, here's a project manager resume example.\nThis resume was crafted by a certified professional resume writer specifically for the role of a Project Leader.\nProject Leader Resume Example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nThere are several things that make this project manager resume example noteworthy:\nA strong and effective resume summary is right at the top;\nThe work experience bullet points include great examples of how Tizian used his problem-solving and negotiation skills (e.g. “Identified and resolved any problems and worked on the reduction of unnecessary expenses.”);\nSkills section is thematically divided into three blocks: language, computer, and soft skills;\nIt includes relevant hard skills for a project manager role;\nEmphasis on important soft skills (communication, analytical, leadership, etc.)."}}]}

The competition is fierce and the talent pool is starting to feel more like an overcrowded jacuzzi, rather than the Olympic-size swimming pool we were used to.\nWhat's more, a series of tech layoffs are creating even more obstacles for job seekers.\nFortunately, we've discovered an extraordinary resume from one of our users that successfully landed them a job at Microsoft as a Cloud Program Manager — and we're here to analyze their resume to see what set them apart from the rest. \nWith a detailed analysis of each resume section, we'll provide insight into:\nwhat works and what doesn't;\nwhat made it effective;\nhow you can apply similar strategies to your own resume.\nUltimately, our goal is to help you improve your own resume and increase your chances of landing your dream job. \nDisclaimer: This resume example was published with the consent of its creator. It was made using Kickresume’s templates. The resume was anonymized.\nMicrosoft resume: Cloud Program Manager\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nTo see the full, two-page version of the resume, click directly on the image.\nContact information\n\nOverall, this section is concise and straightforward, providing essential information about the job seeker: address, phone number, email, and web handle. All that's needed. \nPaul also made a good decision not to include a resume photo. Why? Because including a photo on a resume has a lot to do with your location. And, in English-speaking countries — where Paul is based —  adding a picture to your resume isn't a good move. \nOne improvement that could be made is the addition of a LinkedIn profile. Doing so would provide a comprehensive look at his professional identity. Although we can see that Paul provided a Web handle, which was, however, changed in order to retain his identity. The original resume included a link to an online version of his resume. \nProfile summary\n\nPaul's profile summary starts with his current role as a Cloud Solutions Architect, along with his IT experience. This efficiently communicates his level of experience and skill set in the field right off the bat.\nAlso, Paul includes a concrete example of his success. He highlights his work with large enterprise clients to design solutions leveraging data and turning it into intelligent solutions. \nMentioning that he was featured on Microsoft's wall of experts and speaking at multiple technical conferences helps to reinforce his credibility and expertise in cloud solutions and infrastructure.\nWhat could be improved is using \"I\" less throughout the summary and potentially reworking a few sentences for readability and flow. \nOverall, this section does an excellent job of summarizing the job seeker's skills and experience in a concise, easy-to-read format.\nSkills\n\nOkay, this section is likely what won Paul the job at Microsoft. Here's why:\nFunctional resume format. Paul placed the Skills section at the beginning of the resume, before work experience. This resume format allowed him to draw attention precisely to his skills, which are critical in the cloud computing and IT infrastructure fields.\nVisual formatting. Big. Red. Blocks. That's bound to draw your attention right away. That's why this resume template (called “Red”) is a great choice for functional resumes. So, kudos to Paul's strategy to ensure his expertise isn't overlooked.\nImpressive length. The length of the skills section is also notable. It provides clear evidence of his diverse skills and makes a strong case for his suitability for the role of Cloud Program Manager at Microsoft. \nAs for the concrete skills listed, Paul lists various important tools and technologies like Azure Active Directory, Azure Data Factory, SQL Data Warehouse, and others. Possessing an in-depth knowledge of these tools and having hands-on experience is critical for a Cloud Program Manager.\nAdditionally, the mention of specific cloud technologies like Hybrid Cloud, Azure Stack, and Cloud IaaS / PaaS, as well as management solutions like Identity and Access Management, and Enterprise Mobility, also showcases his expertise.\nFurthermore, expertise in Machine Learning, Office 365, and PowerBI demonstrates that Paul is knowledgeable in both technical and practical aspects of the role.\nThis extensive list of skills is clearly tailored to the requirements and expectations of Microsoft.\nWork experience\n\nThe work experience section of this resume does a lot of things right. \nPaul clearly specifies the duration and location of each role. He highlights his professional history and showcases his experience with reputable companies like Microsoft Canada and Microsoft US.\nThe use of a brief description for each role, along with a bullet point list of major responsibilities, makes the resume more scannable and reader-friendly. It also provides a clear understanding of his involvement and achievements within each role.\nHowever, there's some room for improvement:\nAdding more measurable achievements to show the impact he made in each role. For instance, mentioning the growth percentage in the Office 365 migration business or the number of successful RFP responses would give more weight to his experience.\nRearranging the bullet points to highlight the most impressive or relevant points first would help grab the reader's attention better, making it easier for the hiring manager to spot his key contributions and achievements.\nUsing bold text to highlight keywords or important phrases. This technique can help emphasize critical skills or achievements, making them stand out and ensuring the hiring manager notices them.\nEducation\n\nIn the education section, both academic experiences are presented in a clear and concise way, listing the dates, degrees, and institutions. \nIt's not at all an issue that this section is so brief. In the IT field, skills and experience often carry greater significance than formal education. What's more, as a rule, the more experience you have, the less detail you should include in the education section.\nEmployers in this industry value candidates who can demonstrate real-world experience and concrete skills that they can leverage within their role. \nCertifications\n\nThe certifications section in this resume is a valuable addition, as it showcases Paul's commitment to continuous learning and staying current in his field. \nThe inclusion of Microsoft certifications, specifically Office 365 Solutions Architect and Azure Solutions Architect, directly relates to the Cloud Program Manager role and highlights his expertise in industry-relevant technologies.\nOne potential improvement could be to add the certifying organization for the ITIL certification. Just as he did with the Microsoft certifications. \nKey takeaways: Microsoft resume \nThis resume analysis has shown that Paul has done quite an impressive job in showcasing his skills and experience to secure the Cloud Program Manager role at Microsoft. \nTo wrap things up, let's highlight the top 3 standout features of this resume:\nFunctional resume format. Placing skills before experience emphasizes Paul's wide range of abilities, making it a smart choice for this field.\nEye-catching skills section. The attention-grabbing and detailed list of cloud technology and tech skills clearly demonstrates Paul's expertise.\nRelevant certifications. By adding industry-specific certifications, the job seeker shows his commitment to continued learning and staying current in his field.\nAll in all, the job seeker managed to display his abilities, experience, and qualifications effectively within this resume. \nIf you're an aspiring Cloud Program Manager, consider using this example as a template to craft your own resume, raising your chances of grabbing your dream position.","URL Slug":"microsoft-resume:-analysis-of-a-cloud-program-mana"}}]}

They talk about the jobs they’ve held, describing the way and speed with which they’ve been climbing the career ladder.\n\nBut for a job seeker with little or no experience, functional — or hybrid — resume is definitely a better option.\n\nIt enables you to prioritise some sections in favour of others. And being able to showcase your skills first will help you effectively make up for the lack of work experience.\n\nno experience resume\nThink smart and turn your disadvantage into an asset.\nIn other words, don’t get hung up on where you fall short. You need to specify what you can bring to the table. In lieu of work experience, it's best to focus on your education and skills you’ve developed during college and expand these two sections on your resume.\n\nSkills section\nMost resumes start by listing the candidate’s most recent jobs. You, however, need to list skills rather than roles and back them up with some evidence.\n\nThis section is a great place to highlight both your technical expertise and transferable skills.\n\nPrepare a list of skills and situations where you used them for illustration. By using specific examples, you’ll make your skill-based resume far more powerful and believable.\n\nThink about situations where you best demonstrated your ability to:\n\nTake on responsibility.\nLead and inspire others.\nShow initiative and determination.\nBridge the gap between others to get them working together.\nBuild something or make it work again.\nIncrease efficiency.\nMeet a challenge in an innovative way.\nRemember that you need to be specific with your skills. If you’re a social media expert, for example, you need to list the various social media sites you have expertise in. The same goes for experience with specific computer programs that are relevant for the job.\n\n\nEducation section\nThe Education section on the resume of a seasoned professional is usually fairly compact. Its sole purpose is to prove they have a degree.\n\nThat’s why the only thing they’ll include is the name of the school and degree, graduation date and grade.\n\nYou need to think differently, though. Play up your degree and pack your Education section with other information that speaks of your professional skills and personal qualities:\n\nGrades\nAcademic awards\nRelevant coursework\nGroup project work\nPresentations\nPublications\nSchool societies\nSport clubs\nYou sure have plenty to draw on from your studies. While these may not have been paid work experiences, they still present valid experience that you should include on your resume.\n\nAs a college graduate, you can delve deeper into specialised courses, school societies or interesting coursework.\n\nThink about the skills that stemmed from this experience and make you a good fit for your target job.\n\nEven a high school graduate can describe their electives, why they chose to take them and what they learned from the class.\n\nYes, it may take some time to brainstorm and recall all these details. But without relevant work experience, the success of your resume — in large part — stands and falls on the depth of your Skills and Education section.\n\nno experience resume\nTake stock of your achievements and activities.\nAn additional Achievements section can act as an extension of your Education section and will help you fill space on your resume.\n\nStart by making a list of absolutely everything you've done that you are really proud of. From that list, you'll be able to narrow down things to include on your resume.\n\nThe thing is that different achievements might be relevant to different jobs you’ll be applying for. So it’s very useful to keep a full list and pick only the most relevant ones when the time comes.\n\nDid you organise an on-campus event, present a paper at a conference, volunteer for a good cause or write an article for the school magazine? These are kinds of accomplishments that deserve a place in the Achievements section in your resume.\n\nno experience resume\nTreat your internships and extracurricular activities as regular jobs.\nDespite being unpaid, these activities can showcase your soft skills and help recruiters gauge your professional aptitude. Each one of them should come with a few points that detail the responsibilities you had:\n\nInternships\nPaid and unpaid college internships are one of the best weapons against \"experience required\" line in a job posting.\n\nUse this unique opportunity to gain some relevant work experience. An internship is also a place where you can network and make connections that you will use later during your job search.\n\nVolunteering\nMost recruiters look at volunteer experience similarly to a paid work experience. In other words, just because you didn’t get paid doesn’t mean you didn’t do a good job.\n\nGo ahead and list your volunteer roles as you would a full-time job. Detail the length of time you volunteered, relevant tasks you undertook and the skills you gained through the experience.\n\nExtracurricular activities\nYou’ll often find your extracurricular roles very similar to regular jobs. If you’re applying for copywriting job, for example, recruiters will be more impressed to hear that you wrote a handful of articles for your student newspaper than that you had a summer job in a local fast food restaurant.\n\nno experience resume\nAdd some personality.\nRecruiters have to deal with many applications for each graduate job. Standing out from the crowd and making yourself memorable is the best move towards getting called in for an interview.\n\nHave you run a marathon? Won an unusual award? Skydived in the Alps? These unusual and surprising things deserve to be in your resume.\n\nObviously, these experiences are not relevant professional skills, so avoid listing them in your Skills or Achievements section.\n\nSimply list them in your Hobbies section and don’t bother going into detail. The goal here is simply to make a memorable first impression, not to convince the recruiter that running those 26 miles has prepared you for the job of an accountant.\n\nPreparing to draft a resume with no prior experience? No need to fret! Utilize our AI resume builder and transform your limited experience into a compelling narrative that showcases your potential.\n\nFind other ways to stand out.\nCreate a resume like no other.\n\nCreate resume\nKeep it professional even before you become a professional.\nWhile there are many elements that should be a part of your resume, there are a couple of things that can ruin your job search before it even begins.\n\nStay away from including these things on your resume:\n\nThe word “resume”\nPhotographs\nYour age, date of birth, race, sex, sexual orientation, religion or political affiliation\nReferences — include a note \"references available upon request\" or attach a separate list of references\nWriting samples — include them on a separate sheet of paper\nInformation about your grammar school\nUnrelated work experience or hobbies\nNegative words or ideas\nMost of them will waste valuable space on your resume, won’t tell the recruiter anything relevant or — at worst — destroy your chances of getting a job entirely.\n\nLast but not least, make sure you’re not using an unprofessional email address. “Punksnotdead2000@email.com” may have sounded great when you were young, but it’s not what you want prospective employers to see.\n\nTo get this right, head over to Gmail or Yahoo. Creating a free professional-looking email address to use on your job searching journey is a matter of seconds.\n\nno experience resume\nPay attention to technical details and mistakes.\nTake that extra time to edit and proofread your resume before sending it out. In an entry-level resume, you can’t simply afford a typo or missing word.\n\nMake sure there are no punctuation, grammatical or spelling mistakes that will make your resume look awkward. If your resume sounds too dull and boring, use language in a smart way and utilise action verbs and powerful adjectives to keep your readers engaged.\n\nThen have a friend or family member read it over once again to catch mistakes you may have missed. They might also provide some useful feedback and describe their feelings after reading your resume.\n\nCustomise your resume for each job you're applying to.\nMany college students are too lazy to tailor their career documents to the positions they’re applying for. And that’s a mistake that can often cost them a job.\n\nBeat the crowd and adjust your resume to each job you’re opting for. Consider replacing your academic achievements or irrelevant skills to better match the job’s requirements. Recruiters will appreciate you’ve made some effort and haven’t just sent out a dozen identical resumes to a dozen different companies.\n\nno experience resume\nRemember that fortune favors the prepared.\nZero experience or tons of experience. Doesn't really matter.\n\nIf you really want your career to take flight, you need to be prepared. To talk about your skills and achievements with confidence. To control your body language during your first job interview. Or to be able to negotiate your salary.\n\nThere's no shortcut to experience. But once you decide to walk that extra mile, you're on the fastest way to become a true professional.\n\nGood luck with that!","URL Slug":"how-to-write-the-perfect-“no-experience”-resume?","Meta Description":"Learn how to How to Write the Perfect “No Experience” Resume? and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

Before we learn how to write a good resume, we should know what a resume even is. \nThe word resume comes from French, meaning “summary”. This is the perfect word because that’s exactly what a resume is: a short, straight-to-the-point summary that details your professional achievements, skills, qualifications, education, work experience, and past employers. It's also known as a curriculum vitae (CV).\nThe aim of a resume is to get invited to a job interview. It should aim to convince an employer that you're a good fit for the job. \nBecause of that, your resume should be adjusted and tailored to each job vacancy.\nTL;DR Here's a step-by-step video guide on how to write a professional resume in 2024\nIf you’re already familiar with what should be on your resume and just want a quick and informative recap, or if your time is limited, just check out our 5-minute step-by-step video guide.\nBefore you start writing your resume\nBefore we move on to how to write a resume, we recommend setting a few minutes aside for research. These few minutes can save you hours of frustration and ultimately make your job search that much easier.\nHere’s what we recommend to research before you write your resume: \nResearch the company, specifically the “About Us” page. This is a great place to search for keywords you can use in your resume or cover letter. What are their mission statement and their values?\nResearch the position you’ll be applying for. Great resumes are tailored to a specific job opening. You can do this by asking these three questions as you go through the job post: “What are the essential keywords? What adjectives, nouns, and phrases occur repeatedly? What language does the company use?”\nDiscover your strong points, as this will make it easier to pinpoint the qualities you want to highlight in your resume. Ask people around you: “What are my skills and abilities, and what are my weaknesses?” Also, look at your past accomplishments. What were the skills and abilities that helped you succeed in the past?\nAnother way of preparing for writing your resume is by looking at these well-researched, specifically tailored, and properly formatted resume examples in our database. You can even filter them by your job title.\nNot enough time?\nLet your resume write itself. All you’ll have left to do is edit the draft.\nUse AI resume writer\nHow to write a resume\nWe'll walk you through nine essential steps to help you create a standout resume.\nChoose the right resume format.\nDifferent resume formats cater to different types of job seekers, depending on the experience level and career goals. The three most commonly used resume formats are chronological, functional, and combination (hybrid).\nAdd contact information and personal details.\nYour resume should include your contact/personal information right at the top, in a so-called resume header. A resume header is more than just your name and contact details. Depending on your career path, there's a lot more that can (and should) be included in this section. To find out what to include, what to skip, and how to format it keep on reading.\nBegin with your professional summary.\nA professional summary (also called resume profile or resume summary) is a short paragraph that summarizes your relevant skills, experiences, and achievements. Think of it as a teaser for the rest of your resume.\nList relevant work experience.\nThis is the most important section of your resume. You need to include key information like: names of companies, locations, job titles, positions held, dates of employment, responsibilities you've had. Then:\n- list the jobs in reverse-chronological order\n- write in bullet points\n- include your quantifiable achievements\n- avoid buzzwords\n- use action verbs and keywords from the job description\nSummarize your education.\nThe education summary section, though important, varies in significance based on your career stage. As an experienced professional, prioritize work history and skills, placing education after. Keep it concise, including university, degree, and graduation year.\nHighlight your soft and hard skills.\nSkills fall into two categories: hard and soft.\n1. Hard skills are teachable and measurable, acquired through training, and include computer proficiency, language abilities, project management, etc.\n2. Soft skills, linked to personality traits, can enhance both work and personal life, encompassing communication, leadership, and time management, among others.\nAdd optional resume sections.\nThese can include: achievements and awards, certifications and licences, language skills, publications, references, hobbies, social media, volunteering, or custom sections.\nWrap it up with a cover letter.\nA good cover letter should answer the following questions:\n1. Who are you? \n2. Why are you interested in working for their company?\n3. Why are you the best fit for the job opening?\n4. How can you enrich their company?\nIn the following chapters, we look at each step in more detail and give you helpful tips and examples.\nStep 1: Choose the right resume format\nOnce you know what the company and job require and you’ve identified your strengths and weaknesses, you should be ready to pick the right resume format. \nMake this choice depending on the stage of your career: \nAre you a seasoned professional? Then you should pick a resume format that emphasizes your experience.\nAre you a fresh graduate? Then your resume should highlight any transferable skills you’ve acquired during your studies.\nAre you changing careers? Then a combination of the two will produce the best results.\nPick the best option for your career from the three dominant resume formats that are in use today:\nChronological resume format. Probably the best choice for experienced professionals. Lists the candidate’s jobs and accomplishments in chronological order. Main resume section: Work Experience.\nFunctional resume format. Great for fresh graduates, IT professionals, or other skill-based professions. Emphasizes skills instead of experience. Main resume section: Skills.\nCombined resume format. A combination of the previous two.\nLet's take a look at what these resume formats look like in practice:\nChronological resume format\n\nFunctional resume format\n\nCombined resume format\n\nThe resume format you choose will determine how you organize the information on your resume. It will also attract attention to some things and away from others. \nTake time to understand your strengths and weaknesses and choose accordingly.\nYou want the recruiter to read the strongest and most relevant parts of your resume at the start. For more, check out a guide on how to choose the right resume format.\n\nStep 2: Add contact information and personal details\nYour contact/personal information should always be at the top of your resume in a so-called resume header.\nCompared to the other resume sections, filling in the contact information section may seem super easy. That's until you start asking more questions.\nShould you put your address on the resume? How to include social media, and should you? And what about the date of birth? \nWell, let’s see: \nName. Absolutely necessary. Put your first name first and surname last. Middle name is optional.\nTitle. Optional. If you’re applying for a position in a traditional or specialized field, it's good to add your Ph.D., MBA, or other titles to it.\nEmail address. Absolutely necessary, even when you’re sending your application by email. Your email address should look professional (e.g. john.day@gmail.com, NOT johnny69@gmail.com). Always use your personal email address, not the email address with the domain of your current employer. \nHome address. Somewhat problematic. Your neighborhood can say a lot about you in some cases, disclosing living in a certain area can lead to discrimination. On the other hand, if you’re located in the same city as the company, it may help you to get the job, as it saves the company that they'd have to spend on a relocation package (of course, only if the job isn't remote).\nPhone number. Necessary. Many employers will call you by phone to arrange an interview, instead of doing it by email.\nLinkedIn. Recommended. And if you don’t have a LinkedIn profile yet, consider creating one. Make sure your profile is complete and up-to-date.\nSocial media. Optional. Include it only if it’s related to your job. GitHub, Behance, and even your Facebook or Instagram profile will do (if you regularly post content that has to do with your profession). Here are a few tips on how to include your social media. \nBlog/website. Optional. Similar to social media. If you have a blog, website, or digital portfolio related to your chosen profession, don’t be afraid to show it off.\nPhoto. Problematic. It depends on the country. In most English-speaking countries, they don’t add a photo. See this guide to know if you should put a picture on your resume.\nStep 3: Begin with your professional summary\nYour professional summary should be a list of about 4-5 bullet points or a short paragraph that summarizes your relevant skills, experiences, and achievements.\nYou can think of it as a teaser for the rest of your resume. Make sure it’s interesting enough to hook the hiring manager right in.\nBut how do you write a good professional summary?\nWrite your professional summary last. It’s surprisingly easy to do if you’ve already finished other sections of your resume.\nThe first bullet point should describe your professional title. Don’t forget to add the number of years of experience. Write it in bold if the number is especially impressive.\nPick the most impressive parts of your resume and rewrite them into snappy bullet points. Tease your potential employer into reading further.\nPack your professional summary with relevant keywords. Think of ATS. This will help you get through automated pre-screenings.\nQuantify every achievement if possible. This will make you look even more professional. \nTie every bullet point to the requirements introduced in the job offer.\nIf you do everything right, you should end up with something like this:\n\nStep 4: List relevant work experience\nThe work experience section is what most people picture when they think “resume”.\nThe trick is to focus on your past achievements, not your responsibilities. \nHiring managers are likely to know what your responsibilities were supposed to be. In most cases, your job title says it all.\nIf you want to stand out, you should tell them how you excelled in your previous job instead. \nAnd there’s hardly a more effective way to do that than by mentioning your achievements.\nBut how do you list your work experience on a resume?\n\nPut your work experience section in the right spot. If you can boast a lot of professional experience, put your work experience section right under your resume summary. If you don’t have enough experience yet, put it just below your education section. Finally, if you prefer to highlight your skills instead of experience, put your skills section first.\nGive it a proper heading. Keep it simple and stick to “Work Experience” or “Employment History” as other headings might not be understood by applicant tracking systems (ATS).\nList your jobs in reverse-chronological order. Start with your most recent experience and work your way back from there. Based on your level of experience, decide how far back should your resume go.\nDon’t include the job description. Instead of listing what you were supposed to do, try to tell your potential employers what positive results you had.\nWrite in past tense. This will help you focus on your past achievements instead of responsibilities. It also sounds better.\nShow your problem-solving skills. In the end, hiring managers want to know how effective you’re going to be in solving real problems. There’s no better way to show your problem-solving ability than to briefly describe how you solved difficult problems in the past. Follow the PAR scheme: What was the (P)roblem? What (A)ction did you take? What was the (R)esult?\nQuantify results. Hiring managers love measurable results. Because of that, a single number often speaks more than a thousand words. Don’t say that you “increased the company’s revenue significantly.” Instead, don’t be afraid to brag about “increasing the company’s revenue by 20%.”\nUse bullet points. Bullet points help you structure each subsection. Try to limit yourself to about 5 bullets per job.\nAvoid buzzwords. People used some phrases in their resumes so much, these words have become meaningless. Everybody seems to be an out-of-the-box creative thinker with a knack for innovation nowadays. But in reality, only very few people really are those things. See what other 10 buzzwords you should stop using on your resume\nUse action verbs. Unlike buzzwords, action verbs carry the weight you need to persuade an employer to hire you. Just to mention a few, these are words like “developed”, “increased”, “facilitated” and others. For more action verbs, check out our resume cheat sheet.\nKeywords. Reread the job description and carefully pick the most important keywords. These are the words that best describe the position you’re applying for, and that will attract the attention of the ATS system. \nIn the end, your work experience section should look a bit like this:\n\nStep 5: Summarize your education \nThe education summary section is where you list your degrees and relevant academic accomplishments.\nBased on your degree and where you're in your career, it can be either the least or the most important part of your resume.\nAre you an experienced professional?\nOnce you become more experienced, the education section takes a back seat to your work history and hard skills.\nIn other words, your education section should come after your work experience section, not the other way around. It also shouldn't be too long. For instance, your grades are no longer relevant.  \nIt’s enough if you include the name of your university, the name of your degree, and the year you graduated.\nHere’s an example:\n\nAre you a fresh graduate?\nThen your degree is still one of the strongest cards you have to play.\nIn practical terms, it means that you should place your education section at the top of your resume — right between your professional summary and work experience section.\nIt should also be a bit longer. \nThese are the things you should add to your education section if you’re a student or a fresh graduate:\nAcademic awards. AP scholar, Duke of Edinburgh award, National Merit Award, President’s Award, school subject-based awards, dean’s list, etc.\nScholarships. Athletic scholarships, scholarships for women, creative scholarships, etc.\nAcademic conferences and symposia. Don’t forget to mention the scope and name of the paper you presented at a conference.\nRelevant student societies. Debating or programming clubs. If you were on a student committee of any kind, mention that too.\nGPA. Only include your GPA if it was higher than 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. If your overall GPA was lower, mention your overall GPA. Alternatively, mention your summa cum laude or magna cum laude.\nAcademic publications. Producing an academic work worth publishing is impressive no matter the context.\nIn the end, your education section can look like this:\n\nStep 6: Highlight your soft and hard skills \nBefore you start writing, you should know there are two types of skills: hard skills and soft skills.\n1. Hard skills can be learned, taught, and most importantly — measured. Acquiring them requires deliberate effort, training, and time.\nHard skills can be, for instance: computer skills, language skills, manual skills, mathematics, project management, etc.\n2. Soft skills are tied to your personality traits. These skills can come as part of your upbringing, or you can acquire some later in life through self-improvement. These skills can bring value to any job, as well as your private life.\nExamples of soft skills include: communication, leadership, time management, creativity, decision-making, etc.\nBut how to make your skills stand out?\nFocus on what’s most relevant. Do you have any of the skills mentioned in the advertisement for your desired job? Good. Make sure to include them in your resume’s skills section.\nOrganize your skills into subcategories. Divide your skills section into several subsections like computer skills, soft skills, languages, and others.\nDon’t underestimate soft skills. 67 percent of HR managers said they’d hire a candidate with strong soft skills even if their technical abilities were lacking. On the contrary, only 9 percent would hire someone with strong technical credentials but weak soft skills.\nThere are skills you shouldn’t include. Never include any skills you don’t have, skills that have nothing to do with the job, skills everybody should have, or skills that have become obsolete.\n\nStep 7: Add optional resume sections\nApart from the standard resume sections we just mentioned above, are also optional sections. \nA good rule of thumb is to add an optional section only if it's relevant to the job you're applying for. If done properly, these sections can help you:\nFill the gap when lacking experience\nHighlight additional skills and expertise \nLet an employer know more about who you are\n\nPro tip: Optional resume sections can be especially important to companies that prioritize hiring candidates who fit their workplace culture. \nHere are some of the most common optional sections: \nTechnical skills\nThis section can be a nice addition when applying for (surprise!) technical jobs. \nSome examples of technical skills are: programming languages, software proficiency, project management, and data analysis.\nTechnical skills are usually measurable, so if you decide to include them in your resume, use a graph or a scale to illustrate how strong they are. Adding visual elements to your resume not only looks nice but also shows your ability to be precise and analytical.\nAchievements and awards\nScholarships, competitions, work-related awards, or even promotions to leadership positions in your job — all of these can be considered important professional achievements. \nEither distribute them across other parts of your resume or put them in a dedicated section. The latter allows you to truly highlighted them. \nAnd if you choose to include them in a separate resume section, don't forget to mention the dates and the name of the company/institution at which you've accomplished the achievement. \nProfessional references\nIn today's competitive job market, strong professional references can be a game-changer. Consider including a 'Professional References' section in your resume to provide potential employers with easy access to these valuable resources.\nHow to format references on resume? Here's what you should list for each reference:\nTheir full name\nTheir current job title and organization\nTheir contact details (email and phone number will do)\nYour relationship with them (e.g., Former Supervisor)\nEnsure you have their permission and inform them when actively job searching.\nOnce you decide who you want your references to be, it's time to ask them if they agree. Here's how to ask someone to be a reference via email.\nCertifications and licenses\nListing the certificates and courses that you've successfully completed on your resume is never a mistake.\nHowever, keep in mind that they should be related to the role that you're applying for. \nIf you'd like to add a certificate to your CV but you're unsure about where to find the best course for you, check out this carefully curated list of the best online courses that will help you to get a job. \nPublications\nIn this section, you can mention all the relevant conferences, presentations, and written publications. \nThis section is most useful if you're working in academia, marketing, or journalism. \nHowever, include it in your resume also if you're applying for a position that requires you to be an expert on the topic that you've written about.\nVolunteering\nThis section lists your volunteer work. It should be treated similarly to a work experience section. The reason is that whether your work was paid or not, it still translates to real-life experience. \nThis is true especially if you find yourself at the beginning of your career. In that case, feel free to place the volunteering section towards the start of your resume. \nOn the other hand, if you're a seasoned professional, locate this section more toward the end of your document. \nHobbies\nThis is the part of your resume that's the most personal. Here, let a little loose and let your personality shine through. List you hobbies and interests, even the quirky or unique ones.\nHobbies serve as a great way for a hiring manager to see you more as a person and less as just a name written on a paper. They can also break the ice during the interview stage.\n\nChristy's word of advice\nReally, it sounds so simple, but one of the best ways to stand out with your resume is to apply for jobs you’re a close fit for. So many people apply ‘just in case they’ll consider me if even I only meet some of the requirements’, then feel deflated when they’re rejected. The company has spent time figuring out exactly what they need and are paying their staff or a recruiter to find that. Look closely at the minimum/essential requirements, apply for jobs you’re a great fit for, and you’ll have much better luck!\nChristy Morgan, Resident HR Expert\nStep 8: Wrap it up with a cover letter \nPhew! Almost done with how to write a resume. Just a little bit of editing and proofreading, picking the right resume template, and you should be able to click send, right? \nWell, not quite. At least we wouldn’t recommend you sending it —  yet. \nThe truth is that resumes are often put aside when not accompanied by a cover letter. It would be a shame if this happened to you, especially after all the time you’ve spent creating it. \nA good cover letter is a way to stand apart from the competition. It’s where you can show your hiring manager you mean business. \nAnd, if you're fresh out of college or changing career this step-by-step guide on how to write a cover letter with no experience will show you what to focus on instead. \nHere are 4 questions to guide you while writing your cover letter: \nWho are you (professionally)? \nWhy are you interested in working for their company?\nWhy are you the best fit for the job opening?\nHow can you enrich their company?\nWhen all it’s said and done, your cover letter should look something like this:\nCover letter example\n\nThis cover letter sample was provided by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nWant more inspo? Browse another 1,250+ cover letter examples by your profession.\nAnd if you really want a memorable cover letter, we’ve got you covered. In fact, we’re certain it will be the only cover letter guide you’ll ever need. \n\nFinal tips before you click “Send”\nThe older the job, the fewer the details. In other words, don’t have 13 bullet points on a job from 5 years ago.\nUse off-peak hours for maximum attention, especially if you’re reaching out to an employer directly. Hiring managers are busy people and you want them to receive your resume when they have enough time to carefully read through it.\nCheck your resume for typos. If English isn't your first language, employers might be inclined to overlook any grammatical mistakes that you make in your resume. Typos, on the other hand, are unforgivable. Your computer’s spell-check feature can help you fix that.\nCustomize your resume for each job application. Every employer is different. And any hiring manager can tell if you’ve just sent them the same generic resume as to everyone else. So make sure you tailor your resume to each individual employer to increase your chances of getting hired.\nGet the introductory email right. It doesn’t matter that you have the best resume ever if nobody gets to read it. Attach it to an email that catches the employer’s attention from the get-go. Pay particular attention to the subject line that will make them read the full email, including the attachments."}}]}

While you're happy about starting a new adventure, you may also wonder where to begin. Well, updating and tailoring your resume is always the best start for a career change. \nAt first, the prospect of starting from scratch all over again may seem daunting. But remember that you're not alone in this. People change careers all the time for all kinds of reasons, and they do so successfully. \nWhat's more, you won't really have to start from scratch, will you? After all, now you have all the skills you've acquired during your career up until now. You just need to be able to demonstrate that you can also make use of them in your new professional path. \nSo if you're among those who are brave enough for a career change, we've got tips and advice for how to write about your skills and abilities in your resume so you can land a job in a new field.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nAre you ready for a career change? \n1. Choose the right resume format\n2. Open strong with a resume objective\n3. Emphasize transferable skills\n4. Make your past work experience relevant\nFinal tips\nKey takeaways: Career change resume\nAre you ready for a career change? \nFirst of all, are you really sure that you're ready for a career change? Or are you just temporarily fed up and rather than a new professional calling, you need a nice long vacation (or a sabbatical)? \nThere are some “signs” that can help you determine it.\nTake a look at these four common reasons why people decide to make a career change:\nLow career satisfaction. There's nothing really wrong with your workplace, but you just know that the job you do now isn't your calling. \nLow salary. Half of the respondents would be willing to change a job if they were offered a higher salary, according to a FlexJobs survey. And you may be among them. After all, a good salary can easily make you feel satisfied in a position that you otherwise wouldn't consider staying in long-term.  \nBad work-life balance. Do you have enough time for family, friends, and hobbies? Or do you have to work constant overtime and long weekends? We should work to live and not the other way around, right? \nBad workplace relationships. There's a difference between not being friends with your colleagues, and dreading coming to the office every morning because of that one mean colleague, or a rude boss.\nAre any of these reasons on your list as well? If yes, it truly may be the right time to move on. \nHere's how to do that:\nIntroduce yourself with a BANG!\nCreate a new resume for your new career right now.\nCreate resume\n1. Choose the right resume format\nOnce you've truly made up your mind about changing careers, it's time to take concrete steps. \nIn this case, you should start by tailoring your existing resume to the needs of your newly chosen career path.\nMost likely, you'll have to re-arrange your resume sections in such a manner that you'll be able to make your transferable skills shine through and push less important information towards the same end of the document.\nWhat will help you do this is choosing the most appropriate resume format. \nGenerally, there are three common resume formats: \nChronological resume format. This is the standard type of the resume. The work history is the primary section of this resume format. Simply list your current/most recent job first and then continue in reverse-chronological order.\nFunctional resume format. This format lets you put more emphasis on your skills and most important accomplishments. The reverse-chronological list of your work experience is seen as less important. Place it at the bottom of your resume and describe it in less detail.\nCombination resume format. The combination of the previous two types. You still want to place your work experience below skills and accomplishments, but you describe it in bigger detail (as you would in the chronological resume).\nAt the end of the day, the functional (or the combination) format is the best choice for your resume if you're switching careers. \nThese two resume formats will let you highlight the skills you've developed over years of hard work, while putting less emphasis on the fact that they have been gained in a different industry. \nAfter you've successfully chosen the right resume format, let's see what else you can do to impress the recruiter at your new workplace. \n\n2. Open strong with a resume objective\nHR managers are busy people. They don't have much time to go through each resume in detail, as they receive dozens or hundreds of them. \nWhat's more, many of these resumes may come from people who, unlike you, have plenty of industry-related experience.\nBecause of that, you want to catch the hiring manager's attention from the get-go. This will allow you to take control of how they interpret your lack of experience.\nDo so by putting a well-written resume objective at the very beginning of your resume.\nHowever, your resume objective should do much more than just make the recruiter pay attention to the rest of your resume. \nA good resume objective can also help you to:\nExplain your lack of experience in the industry\nAddress the elephant in the room before they even notice it's there. As a career changer, you need to take control of your story as soon as possible. Otherwise, they might see you simply as someone who lacks the necessary skills — and you know there's more to you than meets the eye. After all, you've gained success in your previous career. There's no reason why you should be less successful in the new one.\nCommunicate your motivations \nWhy would anyone want to change careers? In the end, employers are going to ask you about your motivations at some point. The sooner you explain your \"why\", the better. Just like everybody else, hiring managers are more inclined to trust those candidates whose motivations they can understand and relate to. However, never say anything negative about your past employers. Rather articulate your reasons in a way that emphasizes future growth and opportunities.\nEmphasize your transferable skills\nYou need to look for intersections between your old and new career. Take a look at the job advertisement and emphasize any points where the two overlap. Even if you're transitioning into a completely unrelated field, you should be able to fall back upon your soft skills like leadership, communication, or even your language skills.\nShow that you've already embarked on a new career\nChances are you've already come in contact with the field you want to transition into. Ideally, you've even acquired several related hard skills. Emphasize them in your resume objective to show you're serious about pursuing your new career.\nHow does this advice translate to reality? Take a look at this resume sample below: \nCareer Change Resume Example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nNow, let's take a closer look at the resume objective and see if it follows the guidelines we've just outlined:\nCareer Change Resume Objective Example\nCertified Human Resources Associate aiming to leverage an extensive background in experience in digital marketing to develop a career in human resources.\nKnowledge of multiple HR software programs, such as Bamboo HR and Zenefits.\nResults-oriented and self-driven professional with exceptional communication and leadership skills, and the ability to adapt quickly to change.\nLooking for a human resources-related job within a company that offers flexibility and opportunity to grow both personally and professionally.\nHere's a rundown of the strongest points made in the resume objective above:\nPros: \nEngracia's background in digital marketing and her goal to transition to HR is clearly presented right at the beginning.\nThe focus is on relevant hard skills and certifications, such as being a certified human resources associate and proficiency in HR software such as Bamboo HR and Zenefits. \nThe last two points highlight the soft skills and personal motivation for a career switch. Both of these bullet points are extremely important when trying to move into a different field, so if applicable, you should include them in your resume objective as well. \nCons: \nThe resume objective may be a little too long. If the text was divided using bullet points, it would have been easier to read. \nPlacing the “Skills” section right after the resume objective instead of “Work experience” may have worked better for a career change resume.\nThis brings us to the next point.\n\n3. Emphasize transferable skills\nAs you probably know, there are two types of skills: hard skills and soft skills. \nHard skills can be: computer skills, writing skills, management skills, technical skills.\nSoft skills can be: leadership, time management, listening, problem-solving.\nIn your previous career, you probably gained (or perfected) skills from both categories. But unlike hard skills, most soft skills are easily transferable. \nThis will come in handy once you're changing careers, as most of your earned hard skills may no longer be relevant. \nHowever, there's no need to worry. Despite the name, hard skills are usually easier to learn than soft skills. \nAlso, 67 percent of HR managers said they'd hire a candidate with strong soft skills even if their technical abilities were lacking.\n\nCareer Coach Advice\n“When re-positioning your work history for a role in a different industry, focus on describing how you used your soft skills and the results you achieved by applying them. Your soft skills will be the most transferable, and often transcend niche industry specific experience, making you attractive to hiring managers in other industries.”\nNaomi Rothwell-Boyd, Accredited Career Coach and Founder of Tribe and Seek\nHow should you include the transferable skills on your resume?\n1. First, take a look at the job advertisement. Have you acquired any of the listed hard skills in your previous career? If your answer is yes, bingo! Make sure you include them in your resume.\n2. Second, think of any soft skills that could be useful in your new career. Even in more technical jobs, dealing with people is a necessity. Because of that, leadership, negotiation, and communication skills are in high demand in every industry. If you have them, they for sure belong on your career change resume. \n3. Third, avoid buzzwords at any cost. Everybody is flexible. Everybody is hard-working. Today, it's hard to find a single person who's not an out-of-the-box thinker. Unless these words were used in the job advertisement you're responding to, don't use them. Rather focus on skills that are listed in the job ad or skills that are highly relevant for the specific job position.\n3. Finally, complement your “Skills” section with a strong work experience section. Anyone can say they have leadership skills. But if you tell them about how you've already led a team in your previous job, they'll have one more reason to take you seriously.\nHere's an example of a career change skills section:\nCareer Change Skills Section Example\nLanguages: Spanish, English, French\nComputer skills: ActiveCampaign, Moz, Hubspot Marketing, BambooHR, Zenefits\nInterpersonal skills: adaptability, communication skills, change management, leadership skills, negotiation skills, project management, team work, time management\nSo — what did Engracia do right here? \nFirst, she divided her many skills into various sub-sections. This always increases readability and can help you to draw attention to more important information that you want to highlight. \nSecond, the hard skills that she has included are relevant to the HR field. Therefore, she's demonstrating that although she's never worked in the field before, she already possesses the abilities necessary for succeeding in it. \n4. Make your past work experience relevant\nDon't disregard your past accomplishments just because you've decided to transition into a different field. \nYour past work experience can say a lot about who you are and your work ethic. \nLet's take a look at the career change resume example from before and see how Engracia included her work experience:\nCareer Change Work Experience Example\nOnline Marketing Specialist 09/2017 – 11/2019\nAPPR Group, Inc., Barcelona, Spain\n– Recruited, trained, and coordinated 5 summer marketing interns and maintained relevant documents and files.\n– Co-managed the annual digital marketing budget and completed detailed reports on the performance of existing online promotional campaigns.\n– Awarded employee of the month for completing all assigned tasks and projects ahead of schedule. Special recognition for team work and leadership abilities.\nAs you already know, Engracia sought to transition from digital marketing to HR. \nBecause of that, she first mentioned how she recruited and onboarded summer interns in her previous position. This way, they demonstrated that they already know how to employ the skills necessary for the job they sought to transition into.\nAdditionally, Engracia was well-aware that HR involves plenty of administrative work. So, she didn't forget to mention that in her past position, she \"maintained relevant documents and files\" and \"completed detailed reports\".\nAll that remained was to convince potential employers that she's dependable and has a way with people. She did that by including the fact that she was awarded an employee of the month for timeliness and teamwork. \n\nPro tip: Ultimately, you want to make use of your past experience to show that you’re already familiar with some aspects of the new industry and that you’re a reliable and proactive employee who’s eager to learn. \nFinal tips\nNow that we've covered the basics, let's see the final things that you can do to ensure that your career change resume will land you an interview: \nIt's a good idea to do some work related to your new career before actually transitioning into it. Attend related courses, take a part-time job, or try job shadowing and volunteering in the desired field. Then include it in your resume. \nA good place to start are these 30+ best online courses to get a job which include courses provided for free by institutions like MIT, Harvard University or top companies like IBM (e.g. AI Chatbots without Programming course by IBM).\nTailor each resume to a specific job opening. Sending a generic resume rarely leads to success. \nDouble-check, proofread, and avoid typos. \nUse bold text. Highlight any essential and the most impressive parts of your resume information that needs to get noticed by the recruiter. \nBe critical when deciding what's relevant. You don't have to include everything that you've ever done. Focus on the most relevant things and the biggest achievement of your past career. \nAnd that's it!

It places your skills to the forefront and will, thus, let you highlight the skills you've developed over years of hard work, while putting less emphasis on the fact that they have been gained in a different industry. \nOpen strong with a resume objective.\nA well-written resume objective can help you 1.) explain your lack of experience in the industry, 2.) communicate your motivations, 3.) emphasise your transferable skills, and 4.) show that you've already embarked on a new career.\nEmphasize transferable skills.\nIn your previous job, you probably gained both hard and soft skills. Lucky for you, unlike hard skills, most soft skills are easily transferable. This will come in handy once you're changing careers, as most of your earned hard skills may no longer be relevant. Hard skills are, however, easier to learn.\nMake your past work experience relevant.\nHighlight specific achievements, tasks, or experiences that demonstrate how your previous roles have prepared you for success in your new field. Connect the dots between your past and future roles to showcase your adaptability and the value you bring to the table in your career transition.\nThis article was recently updated.

It sits at the top of your resume and, in its one to two sentences, it can persuade your future employer in that you're the one for the job.\nOr, at the very least, make them read the rest of your resume.\nThis brief summary tells your future employer where you're heading and can enhance your resume in an instant. The more specific you are, the better chances you have.\nSo what does a good resume objective look like? Here's an excellent example:\nResume objective example\n“Motivated and resourceful English teacher, with seven years of varied instructional experience, seeking an opportunity to foster student creativity and critical thinking with literature and current technology.”\nA well-crafted resume objective statement relates your skills and abilities to your vision. Indeed, it can boost your chances of scoring a job and convince recruiters you know what you want to do.\nResume objectives are also useful for ambitious job-hoppers and career changers. It helps them better describe their motivation and explain why they're qualified for the job despite lacking industry-relevant experience.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nFour basic ingredients\nSimilar sections — different purpose\nFour basic ingredients\nHow to create a resume objective that gets you hired? These are the details you need to include to make your resume objective work:\n1. Specific job title\nFirst, you need to make it easy for the ATS to process your application. Include the job title you're applying for at a given company.\nT-Mobile Senior Technical Support Specialist Resume Objective Sample\n“Seeking employment as a Technical Support Specialist in a growing company to use my extension background in working with computer issues and networking solutions.”\nIf this feels a bit too short, feel free to expand it. You can also emphasize your commitment and long-term vision.\nNorconsult OSP Engineer Resume Objective Sample\n“Seeking permanent employment as a Telecommunication Engineer in a leading corporate and hence utilizing my astute nature of learning towards the profit of the organization and assist the organization to its highest level of performance and act as the strengthening bond for the growth of my career.”\n2. Years of experience\nNumbers speak volumes. Having 15+ or 20+ years of hands-on experience shows you're a seasoned professional that can easily shoot for a senior position. But even 5+ years spent in the industry can make a difference and show that you've got something to offer.\nExecutive Account Manager Resume Objective Sample\n“Key Accounts Executive with 20-year professional experience and knowledge of IT technologies. I have a background in accounting and finance consulting. I am skilled in executing large (50 mln +) contracts and managing project teams. Looking to take on a senior role as an account executive advisor.”\n3. Your skills\nUse specific keywords from the job listing to emphasize how your qualifications align with the job listing. This will also increase the probability that your resume gets past the company’s applicant tracking system.\nSystem Administrator Resume Objective Sample\n“Detail-oriented IT professional as a software support specialist and systems/network technician. Skilled at operating in a wide range of platforms and excellent written and oral communication skills.”\n4. Your career objective\nStart off by highlighting some of your success stories. Then move on to the kinds of accomplishments you hope to achieve in the future.\nHowever, always keep the job you are applying for in mind. Talk only about career goals and personal growth that are feasible within the company.\nAvoid the common mistake of focusing too much on your own career. You always need to balance it out and say how your skills will be beneficial to the company.\nHere are 5 resume objective samples that do just that. They connect job seeker's career objectives to company goals without compromising either of them:\nErnst & Young Junior Assurance Associate Resume Objective Sample\n“To contribute towards the growth of a professionally managed organization with a clear vision and learning environment, with a proficiency that offers responsibility, challenges, satisfaction and scope for personal development.”\nThe World Bank Technology Researcher Resume Objective Sample\n“To have a growth-oriented and challenging career, where I can contribute my knowledge and skills to an organisation and enhance my experience through continuous learning and teamwork.”\nSutherland Software Engineer Resume Objective Sample\n“Seeking position as a software evangelist where experience with learned skills will be further developed and utilized. Creating sustained adaptation to new technologies and standards and improvising the existing profile of the systemic approach.”\nMozo IT Assistant Resume Objective Sample\n“A proactive and fast learning individual seeking the opportunity for professional experience in database that allows me to develop and expand my ability, knowledge, skills and experience to help the company achieve business goals while sticking to vision, mission and values.”\nSenior Manager Resume Objective Sample\n“I am seeking a Senior Tax Manager position at a growing public accounting firm. My core motivations are learning, serving the public and helping clients obtain financial freedom. As an entrepreneur, I founded an award-winning public accounting firm that has operated successfully since 2001. Prior to this, I worked for five years at one of the nation’s top-50 public accounting firms. I now wish to turn my skills, experience and determination to the task of assisting the public with their tax, accounting and other financial needs.”\nSimilar sections — different purpose\nIt's important to know that there are several alternatives to a resume objective. They may all look alike but serve a different purpose:\nSummary\nProfile\nResume Summary Statement\nStatement of Qualifications\nAll four of them represent a brief summary of your skills and experience that are relevant to a specific job opening. Unlike a resume objective that focuses on your career goals, these sections are less egocentric. They focus on what's your added value and how you can be beneficial to the company.\nHere's an example of a standout profile summary:\nGoogle Server Manufacturing Profile Summary Example\n“Detail-oriented professional with experience in server manufacturing, training development, computer hardware troubleshooting and management. Seeking to take the next career step with respected organization dedicated to world-class quality. Born leader with the ability to lead teams to process and manage large volumes without compromising service or quality.”\nYin and yang\nUndoubtedly, the very first section is the most lucrative spot on your resume. Putting confusing section names aside, you can basically choose to focus on two things — on yourself or your prospective employer.\nThe first approach is egocentric and elevates your experience, skills, achievements and career goals. The second one is more altruistic. It describes how your values align with the company's and how you will use your skills to contribute to its future endeavours.\nNonetheless, both of these perspectives seem equally important. \nWithout knowing your value and listing everything that sets you apart on the top of your resume, you'll never make those 6 seconds count. But the absence of a broader vision can make you look like a career opportunist that lacks basic sensitivity to company goals.\nNow that you're well-versed in writing a compelling resume objective, it's time to put those skills into practice!

The question, though, should rather be whether to even bother writing one. \n\nLet's look at pros and cons of resume objective statements and see whether you really need to add this tricky little thing on your resume.\n\nMany hiring managers think resume objective statements are slightly outdated. This is due to two things:\n\nThe newest trends in resume writing urge you to keep your resume as brief as possible and resume objectives are simply taking up space.\nMost of the objective statements are simply too vague or poorly written and eventually bring no value to the resume.\nGiven that resume objective statements are at the beginning of your resume, they either have to be damn good or go home. The top of your resume is just too much exclusive a space to be wasted.\n\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n\nWhat is a resume objective statement?\nHow to write an outstanding resume objective?\nWhat is a resume objective statement?\n\nA resume objective is a short statement at the beginning of your resume that's supposed to summarize in maximum two sentences why you want the job and what makes you perfect for it.\n\nIt should clearly sketch out your career path and point out your most eminent professional strengths. It goes without saying that your resume objective, just like your resume itself, should be tailored to each position you're applying for.\n\nMany HR managers agree that resume objectives are useless unless they bring a substantial value to the resume. Instead of the resume objective statement, resume summary statements are becoming more popular.\n\nA resume summary statement is a short overview of your career path, skills, and experiences to form a short professional profile. This is a great way for hiring managers to see right off the bat what you bring to the table. To get a better idea of what a resume summary statement is, think of your \"Summary\" section on LinkedIn.\n\nEven though resume objectives are not used as much as before, in some careers and in certain countries they are still used.\n\nAchieve your main objective.\nLand your dream job with a new resume.\n\nCreate resume\nWe recommend using a resume objective in these three cases: \n\nIf you lack work experience or are relatively new to the industry for which you're applying.\nWhen you're radically changing career paths it is somewhat better to write a couple of words before the hiring manager gets to read through your work experience.\nWhen you have gaps in your employment history and you need to excuse your lack of recent work experience.\nHow to write an outstanding resume objective?\nObviously, your main objective is to get the job.\n\nTo deliver this message to the hiring manager, your resume objective should convey three things:\n\nit should showcase your strongest points\nstate how these add value to the position\nand set a concrete goal that you want to achieve.\nBeing specific is key.\n\nYour resume objective should be strategically targeted to the job in question. This means that it should not only sum up your skills and goals but should also contain keywords the hiring manager wants to see.\n\nDon't make your resume objective too long. The recruiters don't have the time reading long essays. No beating around the bush, make it short and get straight to the point.\n\nHere's a good resume objective example:\nResume objective example\nMy main objective is to invest my 5 years’ high-level expertise in SEO and PPC to help this potential tech startup grow by increasing the number of app users and boosting revenues by as much as 30% in the first three months.\n\nOur conclusion\nIn the world of resumes, there really aren't any fixed rules. Even though there are trends and guidelines to follow, every job offer is unique and so should be your resume.\n\nEven though most sources advise you to keep your resume to one page, there are many cases when this doesn't apply.\n\nThe same goes for the resume objective statement. While many HR managers consider it an obsolete practice, it might be a working feature for some job applications.\n\nHowever, we recommend including it only if you have something of value to say. If you put together a killer resume objective and think it might increase your chances of getting an interview, go for it.\n\nIf you were to have it only for the sake of having it, we'd say leave it out. No hiring manager will be impressed by vague statements.\n\nWhen deciding whether to include a resume objective or not, you should take the length of your resume into consideration, too. If your resume is just one page long, you might want to spare room for more important information than what your career objective is.\n\nOn the other hand, if your resume is more than a one-pager, you could even consider adding an executive summary or your short professional profile at the top of your resume.\n\nAll our Kickresume resume templates allow you to include your short profile or a summary statement on top to kick off your resume and introduce your professional self. Your perfect resume is just a click away!\n\nFound our guide on writing a perfect resume objective helpful? Let's keep the momentum going!

In fact, a large majority of job seekers cannot even name their transferable skills. Either that, or they don’t know how these skills can be applied in different fields.\n\nTake writing, for instance. If you’re good at it, you can use it in almost every job imaginable.\n\nAre you building brand awareness? Those writing skills sure come handy when creating social media posts.\n\nAre you planning an event? You can probably write captivating event descriptions.\n\nAre you making a sale? Your writing skills will prove essential when reaching out to people.\n\nSee? A single skill can be useful in a variety of jobs. And that’s why it’s called transferable!\n\nSkills pay the bills.\nCreate a strong resume and get a new job.\n\nCreate resume\nWhat are transferable skills?\nTransferable skills are skills, abilities, and talents that you've acquired through time via different experiences such as school, college, jobs, summer camps, volunteering, sports, hobbies, and so on.\n\nThey’re the skills and abilities that are, in a way, a side product of other knowledge or skill.\n\nHere’s an example: If you’re a fresh graduate, presenting projects and essays in school was just something you had to do while learning more about your subject. In the end, the side product is that you’ve developed at least some presentational skills.\n\nAnother example: If you previously worked as a flight attendant, you probably have strong customer support skills (which is needed in many other jobs).\n\nWhy should you use them?\nHaving a broad set of transferable skills is especially useful to fresh graduates, people with little work experience or those who are about to radically change their career paths.\n\nTransferable skills are great for several reasons:\n\nEverybody has them (even if they don’t know about it). College, university, or your previous job has taught you much more than you think.\nThey translate well into specific job requirements. Transferrable skills can help you show that even though you don't have a specific skill yet, you should be able to learn it quickly.\nThey also include soft skills and employers are finding these increasingly valuable in new hires.\nSimply put, adding transferrable skills to your resume demonstrates that while you might not have applicable direct work experience, you do have skills that can be applied to certain roles.\n\n\nHow to identify your transferable skills?\nOnce you know what career you’d like to pursue, create a list of skills and requirements that are needed for that job position. Then match them with the skills you have. Simple!\n\nAnother approach is self-analysis. Grab a piece of paper and list all the skills that your school, project or current job requires day-to-day. Then see if they match specific jobs.\n\nTo get your mind working, take a look at this list of 10 best transferable skills. Have you mastered any of them?\n\nCommunication and Rhetorical Skills\nThese are the skills you can use in many different industries. If you often presented your work in college, have experience with public speaking or debating societies, go ahead and mention it on your resume.\n\nHave you ever worked in a job that required customer interaction? Even better. Use your resume to elaborate on it and mention a specific example of how you used your communication skills or how it helped you improve the customer satisfaction rate.\n\nWriting Skills\nAre you good with words? Chances are you were good at writing essays in college, took writing classes at uni, started a blog, or contributed to your company's magazine.\n\nYour advantage is that unlike with communication skills, you can always back your writing skills with evidence by submitting your writing samples or linking your resume to your blog or personal website.\n\nResourcefulness\nBeing resourceful is a great virtue. Actually, it's regarded as a sign of intelligence.\n\nIf you don’t get easily scared of the new, always think of creative ways to work things out, or adjust well to new situations, mention it.\n\nThink of a particular task or circumstance where you demonstrated resourcefulness and successfully dealt with the issue.\n\nOrganizational Skills\nHave you ever helped to organize college, community, society, or company events? Or have you demonstrated organizational skills in some other way in school, summer camp, company events?\n\nThen you should definitely mention it if you’re applying for a job where organizational skills might come in handy (e.g. community manager, project manager, office manager, or event manager).\n\nBriefly describe your duties and how you contributed to the smooth running of an event, or mention a number of events that you helped to organize.\n\nAnalytical Skills\nAnalytical skills are useful in many different industries. They’re valued in business, economic and financial sector, marketing, sales as well as in HR or teaching.\n\nIf you can easily solve a problem by splitting it into smaller parts, analyzing them, and arrive to a solution, then go ahead and include it in your resume.\n\n\nCreativity\nIf you’ve ever done anything creative, say, any form of art — painting, creative writing or any crafts —take an advantage of it.\n\nIf you’re a creative person, chances are you can be creative in spheres other than art as well.\n\nNumerical / Arithmetical Skills\nHave you always been good at maths or have you ever demonstrated good number skills?\n\nWhether at uni or any job, say, you’ve been responsible for the cash register or accounting or anything similar, you might translate it well into other fields, too.\n\nTime Management Skills\nTime management is a quality that is valued in every industry imaginable. Also, chances are you've already mastered the art of time management during your studies. How else would you be able to stay on top of your school work? \n\nNot many people can effectively plan their time, be on time, make the most of their working hours, or prioritize tasks and systematically work on them.\n\nIf you can, definitely mention it in your resume!\n\nCustomer Service Skills\nWorking in restaurants, bars or cafés is what most students do to supplement their income. But how do you translate skills from your waiting job into something that can be used in your first job after college? \n\nBeing helpful, patient and polite when dealing with people are traits worth its weight in gold. These are all qualities you almost certainly had to demonstrate in your waiting job.\n\nBesides mentioning these skills on your resume, you can also elaborate on them during the job interview. You can mention a complicated situation that you handled with ease or talk about a time you helped somebody in distress.\n\nDecision-Making Skills\nIf you’ve ever had to make a decision for a larger group of people and it came out great, don’t forget to give yourself credit for that.\n\nDecision-making skills are important because your boss wants to know whether you’re able to think for yourself, are prompt in deciding what’s the best course of action and whether they can rely on you in difficult situations.\n\n\nHow to highlight your transferable skills on your resume?\nIf you already have a list of relevant transferable skills for a specific job position, you can start tailoring your resume directly for it.\n\nFirst of all, choose a correct resume format. If don’t have any work experience or if you’re seeking opportunities in another field, you should opt for functional or hybrid resume format. Both of them focus on your skills rather than your work experience.\n\nAfter that, focus on using keywords and highlighting the skills. You can do that in your skills section but also throughout your whole resume — profile, work descriptions, education description, and so on.\n\nHow? Let’s get back to the example of a flight attendant seeking a customer support role. In the job description, you can add bullet points that say:\n\nPrepared passengers for take-off and landing, and provided excellent customer service at all times;\nResolved passenger issues;\nRecognized by executives for increasing client satisfaction with provided services from 87% to 96% within two years.\nSee how this description draws a strong parallel to what would be required in a customer support position?\n\nAnd that’s how you market your transferable skills on your resume!\n\nGleaned insights on how to effectively showcase your transferable skills on a resume? Brilliant! Now, let's put that insight to work. Transform your LinkedIn profile into a robust resume that highlights your versatile skills.","Meta Description":"Learn how to How to Use Your Transferable Skills Effectively on a Resume and gain insights from real examples.","URL Slug":"how-to-use-your-transferable-skills-effectively-on"}}]}

The best thing to do is to prepare and know how to update your resume after maternity leave.\nBecause once you leave for a maternity leave, you’ll be confronted with a gap in your resume. And future prospective employers will be curious to know why you didn't work for weeks or even months. \nThere’s nothing to fear, though. Your skillset hasn’t shrunk. In fact, it's expanded. \nMothers have to fill in plenty of roles — they're managers, psychologists, doctors, and storytellers. All at the same time.\nTo help you burnish this experience and get your career back on track, here's a short guide on how to update your resume after maternity leave and explain the gap in your resume.\nResume example included, of course.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nWhat do recruiters think about maternity leave? \nThings to avoid when addressing your maternity leave \nHow to update your resume after maternity leave?\nSample of a resume updated after maternity leave \nFinal tips\nWhat do recruiters think about maternity leave? \nMost recruiters will understand the gap in your resume. After all, this won't be their first time reading a resume of a recent mother who's applying for a full-time job. \nIt's good to remember though that it's illegal for potential employers to ask questions about your personal life. \nAt the same time, leaving an unexplained career gap in your resume isn't a good idea either.\nTo admit to an HR manager that your recent resume gap was due to maternity leave has its plus sides but also its downfalls. \nWhile some recruiters may l assume that — thanks to colic and midnight feedings — you may not be able to deliver the best performance at work right now, others may see your recent birth as a good thing. \nIf nothing else, they may assume that you won't be taking another maternity leave anytime soon.\n\nThings to avoid when addressing your maternity leave \nOne thing that you should surely avoid is to hope that the potential employer won’t notice the gap or that you won't have to include it in your resume at all. \nThe best approach is to address the maternity leave head-on in your “Work Experience” section.\nAnd even though the mention of maternity leave concerns your life outside of work, it's still advised to remain professional when talking about it. \nResist the temptation to use euphemisms or joke about it. \nNaming your months (or even years) as \"Domestic Executive\" is just a little cringe on top of it being misleading. \nTo put it simply, being honest and explaining the CV gap openly (but still in professional terms) is the way to go. \n\nHow to update your resume after maternity leave?\nFirst, choose a resume format that will highlight the most important details about your professional qualities and your personality traits.\nThis type of resume is called a functional resume. This CV format lets you introduce your skills first — which is precisely something that you want to do after maternity leave. \nHere's a list of resume sections to include in your updated CV: \nProfessional summary\nSkills\nAdditional skills\nWork experience\nEducation\nVolunteering\nReferences\nOptional (Awards, Accomplishments, Courses, etc.) \n1. Skills \nThe next step of updating your resume after maternity leave is to add newly gained abilities into your pre-existing list of professional “Skills” that you had listed on your old resume. \nHowever, don't add just whatever skill. \nRemember to include those skills that are relevant to the job you're hoping to land and that reflect your experience in your field. \nIf you don't know what we have in mind, take a look at the example of the skills resume section below: \nSkills\nFlexibility\nAccuracy\nAttention to detail\nLogical thinking\nSocial intelligence\nNegotiation\nClient Acquisition\nScheduling\nActive listening\nPublic speaking\nProblem sensitivity\nNetworking\n2. Additional/relevant skills section\nEmployers still often see large employment gaps as a red flag. So, you need to show you stayed on top of the most recent developments in your field. \nIf relevant, show them that you're up to date with the trends in the field by filling in sections such as “Relevant skills” or “Additional skills.” \nHere's an example of how you can do it:\nAdditional Skills \nDuring my maternity leave, I focused on maintaining and enhancing my skill set. That involved enrolling in an online course, continuing education, and participating in a sales conference to ensure that I remained up-to-date with industry happenings.\nSales Success Summit, Boston (June 2019)\nJoining fellow sales leaders, trainers, and enablement professionals to learn expert secrets about sales and marketing.\nThe Art of Sales: Mastering the Selling Process (Northwestern University) – Online course (March 2019 – June 2019)\nCoursework focused on standing out in the crowd, attracting customers, and building support for initiatives within one’s company.\nA description like this will enable you to show that you used your time away from work for self-development, and will also boost your value as an employee. \nYour potential employer will probably appreciate that you're still committed to your career and can contribute to the company's success. \nHowever, in no way this means that you should be pressured into focusing on work during your maternity leave. It's absolutely more than enough to focus on one thing at a time. \nAnd thankfully, many modern workplaces are finally starting to acknowledge this as well.\n3. Work experience \nAfter all of the skills are filled in, the following thing to do is to fill in the “Work Experience.”\nIt's here where you can briefly mention that your career gap was due to maternity leave. \nThis way, your maternity leave won't be the first thing that the recruiter will notice, but it also won't be ignored completely. \nIn this section, make sure to put emphasis on the work you did before you took time off. \nTalk about it — ideally in bullet points — as if it were yesterday. Focus on the details of the projects you worked on.\nRecall your accomplishments and the projects you're proud of from that period of your life. Time doesn’t devalue those experiences and skills you learned working on them.\nSee the sample below for inspiration: \nWork Experience\nCareer break for maternity leave (January 2019 – Present)\nAn extended period of maternity leave to bring up my daughter until she was old enough to start nursery school\nSales Coordinator, Boston (July 2015 – December 2019)\nManaged $500,000 monthly sales figures operated at an average of 28% profit margin\nGenerated over 100 clients and approximately $50,000 in sales within 6 months.\nPrepared contracts, productivity reports, proposals, and letters.\nReviewed and coordinated the implementation of marketing strategies.\nGenerated a monthly revenue report and communicated the results to managers, directors, and executives.\nCreated email correspondence to enhance client communication and maintained the agency calendar.\n4. Education\nThe importance of having a solid education or training doesn't go away just because you took a couple of months (or years) off. \nThat's why in your updated resume, you should highlight your academic accomplishments and again draw some attention to them — even if you've finished your studies years ago. \nHave you graduated with excellent grades or an award? Perfect! Make sure you mention it. \nOn the other hand, remember that skills and work experience still carry more importance, especially if you're a somewhat seasoned professional. \nTherefore, make sure you place your education lower than more important sections.\n\n5. Volunteer activities \nHave you participated in non-professional activities while you were on your maternity leave? \nMaybe you and your children visited a nearby shelter and walked some dogs. Or you helped out during a community event in your neighborhood. \nIf yes, let these activities speak of your determination and a spirit of goodwill. \nMention any relevant community service or voluntary work that you engaged in during (or before) your time away from work in a separate “Volunteering” section.\nTry to draw a conclusion on what you gained in terms of professional insights and technical skills from these volunteer activities. \nEmployers will like seeing you're an active person using their skills and free time in a useful way:\nVolunteering\nAnimal Rescue League, Boston (March 2019 – June 2019)\nresponsible for updating the website and sending out weekly newsletters\nstaffing special events and providing general office support\n6. Optional\nNow think — “What else have I done that makes my professional journey different from everyone else?”\nHave you completed any courses? Won an award? \nPut it in your resume! \nIn other words, demonstrate that you're an active person with drive and many interests in any way you can. \nFinally, any freelancing projects or short-term gigs also work as great resume enhancers.\n7. References\nFinally, you can use the power of networking — even during or after the parental leave. \nStay in touch with others working in your professional field. And think of anyone that could help you find a job and provide a better starting point in your job search.\nCall up your former colleagues, send out emails asking for references and recommendations and use your LinkedIn to make new connections (by the way, your LinkedIn profile deserves a makeover, too).\nHiring managers will appreciate recommendations from trusted authorities — be it your former employers or seasoned field professionals: \nReferences\nMark Stenson, CEO of Total Quality Logistics (TQL), stenson@kickresume.com, 999-999-9999\nThe ability of people to vouch for your skills will ease the potential employer’s concerns and help them focus on your skills and qualifications rather than your career gap.\nSample of a resume updated after maternity leave \nOne image can speak more than a thousand words. See all of the above points summarized in the resume sample below. \nThis is how you do it. \nJane has correctly:\nchose a functional resume format\nbriefly mentioned maternity leave in the “Work experience” section\nincluded industry-relevant skills gained during maternity leave\nadded volunteering experience \nincluded a reference\nOn top of having a good selection and order of resume sections, Jane also selected a resume template that catches the eye of the recruiter with its nice design. \nHer resume is also well-organized and airy as she doesn't waste words and leaves enough space between various sections.\nMaternity Leave Sales Manager Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nFinal tips\nAs you can see, maternity leave resume gaps shouldn't make you feel less skilled or less professional. There are very elegant ways to deal with it on your resume and turn it into an advantage.\nAll in all, you just need to make it clear that you’ve remained committed to your career goals and have the skills and expertise necessary to play a vital role in the company. \nAnd if you get questions about your career gap during your interview, keep it brief and to the point. Don't lie about it or avoid the question. Rather, just quickly move on to other profession-related topics. \nAnd remember — in uncomfortable situations like this, being confident and self-assured can always get you far. \nBest of luck to you!\n\nThis article was recently updated.

He's deciding between becoming an actor or a fitness instructor.\n\nIs he going to send the same resume both to the Universal Pictures and Gold’s Gym? God, no!\n\nHe's going to hit the gym as usual and think about how to tailor the resume based on what the different roles require.\n\nFor the acting job, he decides to emphasize the wrestling experience.

Remember, you are the brand you want to sell.\n\nDoes Microsoft communicate the same message to a corporate client and to a young freelancer? Sure not.

(Read with Tom Hardy’s Venom voice in your head.)\n\nTailor Your Resume to a Specific Job Description\n1. Prepare your generic resume\nIf you don't have a resume, there's nothing to tailor. So look it up in your Documents folder and open the latest version. If you don't have a resume yet or not sure how to write it, here's a nice guide.\n\nSome of the basic information will come useful even when tailoring your resume. You probably did not travel to the past to change your name, date of birth, or education. Or did you, Dr. Who?\n\n2. Do your (job) research\nDo you want to be an astronaut or a rainforest activist? Awesome but if you've never studied space engineering or know nothing about forests and rain, you probably won't get the job even if you tailor the heck out of your resume.\n\nEven though always shooting for stars (pun intended, heh) is a great personality trait, you need to stay realistic about your skills and experiences.\n\nDon't overestimate yourself. Do a thorough research and look for jobs you have at least a small chance of getting.\n\nBut nobody is saying you shouldn't challenge yourself. If you're already a barista, you can always become a great café manager or an assistant roaster.\n\nTailor Your Resume to a Specific Job Description\n3. Analyze the job description\nOnce you've found a suitable job position, you need to analyze the job description. Sometimes the best way to do it is to print it out, take a marker and get your hands dirty. Ask yourself:\n\nWhat are the essential keywords here? (Highlight them, they'll come handy later on.)\nWhat adjectives, nouns and phrases occur repeatedly?\nWhich words are original or untypical?\nWhat language does the company use?\nIt’s not only about the requirements. How the company presents itself and how they're trying to get under the skin of whom they really want to hire is equally important. Soak in the general vibe.\n\n4. Compare your skills and experience\nLet's see what you can bring to the table.\n\nWhich requirements do you meet entirely and what qualities do you lack? Even if you're not a 100% match, you can always aspire to a specific skill or experience. Concentrate on your strengths.\n\nIf the company is looking for a “creative guru,” but you haven't been in a creative job yet, try to think of the “creative guru” traits you might have. Maybe you drew cartoons for a high school magazine, or you were the problem-solver on your current team. It might seem like a long stretch but things like these count.\n\nHere's another example. If your desired job requires you to research questions and answering them, you might mention that you're a top writer on Quora. Of course, it’s not a paid “real-job-your-mama-always-wanted-you-to-have” type of position. But is it relevant? Hell yeah!\n\ntailor your resume to a specific job description\n5. Go back to the highlighted keywords\nHere comes one of the most crucial steps in the process. The hard truth is it's not some sweet, Santa-like figure who'd be deciding whether to send your resume to the second round.\n\nMost of the time, it’s just an automated, cold-hearted robot waiting at the gates. In the recruiting lingo, these robots are called ATS (Applicant’s Tracker Systems).\n\nThese robots don't understand human language very well (yet!). On the other hand, they can read and search for keywords pretty well.\n\nIf you don't include these keywords, ATS might decide you aren't suitable and throws your resume away. Hurts, right?\n\nYou've already found your keywords. Add them to your resume. Use the same expressions as those included in the job description. But put them only in places where it makes sense, don't juggle them around.\n\nCustomize the look of your resume too.\nPick a resume template. Make it more you.\n\nCreate resume\n6. Consider the right design for your content\nWhat form should a resume have? Not always the same.\n\nApplying for a developer’s job in a corporation? A simple, clean, minimalistic approach is the way to go. Tailoring resume for a small yet established and famous online agency? A resume resembling lines of code might help you stand out.\n\nWhat about the structure of your resume? Sure, you always start with the name, address, date of birth, etc. But what then? Go a bit counterintuitive.\n\nEven though you might want to put your most recent experience first, don’t do it every time.\n\nTailoring a resume means you want to fit it to a position you're aiming at. For this reason, you can sometimes leave the most recent for later and start with the most relevant stuff.\n\nMake your resume eye-catching yet simple and easy to read. Today, the internet offers plenty of tools to help you with that (Kickresume saying Hi).\n\nShould you add a picture? If applying for a fashion model, a good idea, for a bank teller, not so much. Also consider your country's best practices.\n\n\n7. To state the objective or not to state the objective?\nIf you decide on a resume objective, be very clear with the objective statement. It helps you send an clear message to recruiters and grab their attention.\n\nState what you're up to, what qualities you can bring to the job, what makes you unique, why they should hire you, etc. The right keywords go a long way here too.\n\nThe objective might also improve your chances if you're considering a career switch. Usually people wouldn’t understand why you're applying for a job with skills that do not match it. Here’s your window to explain get them hooked.\n\nOn the other hand, most HR managers believe that objective statements don't add much to your application. Especially, if you miss the point and only piece together a bunch of outdated buzzwords. If you're determined to include an objective statement in your resume, make sure it's good.\n\ntailor your resume to a specific job description\n9. Ask for honest feedback\nYou don't see yourself the same way others can see you. And that can be either good or bad, depending on the circumstances.\n\nYou might have a skill that's worth mentioning but it would never cross your mind. On the other hand, you might have included a skill or experience you don't really have.\n\nAsk a professional from the field you're applying to. They can help you point out misdirections or unnecessary information, add a skill you'd never thought of, or help you learn industry lingo.\n\nNo industry professionals around? Doesn't matter, ask your brother, mom, or your second cousin twice removed. Anyone who knows you a bit can help.\n\ntailor your resume to a specific job description\nQuick tips on how to polish your tailored resume\n1. Stay clear and concise\nIn the age of fast thumbs and screens, no one's going to pay attention to your resume for more than five seconds.\n\nDon’t waste recruiters’ time on prologues and epilogues. Don’t use fancy words or buzzwords. Go for the kill from the beginning.\n\nDon’t make them read tons of text, highlight (bold, underline) what’s important. Write the information in bullet points, but with additional explanatory sentences, so they can quickly scan the crucial parts.\n\n2. Be ready to prove everything\nAlways look for jobs that suit your abilities and qualities at least to some extent.\n\nSaying something you can’t prove is a way to hell. Or at the very least, it's not a good strategy if you want to do well at the interview.\n\ntailor your resume to a specific job description\nDon’t apply the “fake-it-till-you-make-it” rule here. Always be ready to substantiate everything — with a certificate, a course, an award, a reference from a colleague. You get the idea.\n\n3. Use the right words\nEvery industry has its own jargon. And it's always to your advantage if you can use it in your resume.\n\nLet the recruiters know you're familiar with the topic. Want to be a food critic? Make sure to use at least some culinary lingo.\n\nDon’t forget to also address the tone of your resume. Every single word you decide to use can reveal something about your personality and work in your favor.\n\n4. Share something interesting about yourself\nThis is not a cover letter. Don’t try to write a full-blown essays about yourself. But you can always leave little breadcrumbs of what kind of person you are.\n\nA former race car driver applying for a school bus driver job who likes to bake his own sourdough bread? That's pretty memorable and well worth mentioning.\n\nIt shows not only that you have the driving skills but also that you care about living creatures. (And come on, from the five people around you right now, who bakes their own bread?)\n\ntailor your resume to a specific job description\n5. Check spelling and grammar\nIt might surprise you how many hiring managers are also grammar nazis. Ask yourself, what aftertaste will your resume leave if your potential employer reads “your” instead of “you’re” or “has” instead of “have”?\n\nSure, not everyone can be a LeBron James of grammar. But everybody knows at least one person who can check their grammar and spelling. If you don't, pick one of the hundreds of proofreading services you can find on the internet (Grammarly, Kickresume, etc.).\n\n6. Keep it ATS-friendly\nMost recruiters clearly state in what format they expect to receive your resume. Stick to it. If they ask for a pdf, send a pdf. If they ask for edible paper, ask if they want some sugar with it.\n\nIt’s not just their way of playing games with you. Usually, all resumes go through a software scan first. And we've already mentioned how ruthless these robots can be if you feed them the wrong type of information.\n\nFinally, don't forget to meet all other requirements they ask for – subject line, e-mail address, title, attachments, etc.\n\ntailor your resume to a specific job description\nResume examples and what you can learn from them\nThere's a gazillion ways to get your application discarded.\n\nBut if you're honest about your skills and experience, and if you stick to the steps outlined in this guide, you should be all right.\n\nNeed inspiration? Here are two neat cases of well-polished and tailored resumes to help you tweak yours.\n\nNike Retail Brand Specialist Resume Example\nTailored Resume Example\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\nSienna applied for a Nike retail brand specialist job. Surely enough, her resume helped her a lot. What can you learn from it?\n\nDo you see the sterile office picture? Nope, because none is there. Vivid and dynamic photo expressing Sienna‘s personality is the first thing you notice. She kept the communication and positioning of the company in mind.\nClean, yet visually pleasing and not more than one page long. This is something an athlete-oriented brand receives with open arms.\nBlack shapes in the header and footer distinguishes her resume from others. Unusual color to go with but if put together decently, it can work. Think about ways to stand out from the crowd.\nEven though the text is in Swedish, you can spot the keywords coming out of the resume distinguished from the rest of the page. (If you don't, notice the Strengths section 😀 )\nAir France Team Manager Resume Sample\ntailor your resume to a specific job description\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\nOn the first sight, this resume might seem too long and unstructured, but once you see it more closely, you realize it 's very well put together. What can you learn from it?\n\nYou can either present information verbally and stack up a pile of various adjectives. Or you can be like Stien and come up with a star rating system. Great way for a software developer to show his skill with various technologies.\nStien must have thought about his manager’s abilities and point them out. See page two (click the resume), and get wowed by the excellent system explaining his social, emotional, and cognitive traits without using many words.\ntailor your resume to a specific job description\nThe takeaway: remember these three points\nGreat! You've made it to the end of this guide, which means that you're determined to write the best you've ever written. In the end, it's not rocket science.\n\nIt all comes down to these three basic points;\n\nBe honest with yourself;\nKeep the keywords in mind;\nGive the recruiter something to get hooked on.\nThe first one helps you tailor your resume according to the job description and submit the most relevant versions. The second helps you pass the ATS to the next round. And the third one increases your chances of getting recruiter's attention and getting invited to an interview.

If you don’t, you could easily get swamped and find yourself tumbling down several rabbit holes in your quest for your next executive-level job.\n\nBut what to do once you have narrowed down your search?\n\nTailor your executive-level resume accordingly.\n\nRead on for our four top tips for how to tailor your executive-level resume for a job board.\n\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n\n1. Executive-level resume keywords\n2. Clarify your work history\n3. Go big early\n4. Focus on your leadership abilities\n\n\n\n1. Executive-level resume keywords\nThis tip applies to any resume writing you may do. You can’t make the mistake of believing that only humans will search the job board databases looking for the ideal candidate and naively think that when they stumble across your resume, they will realize they have hit the jackpot. Life just isn’t that kind.\n\nThe majority of recruiters utilize the services of applicant tracking systems (ATS) to do early-stage resume sifting for them. ATSs filter out appropriate resumes that contain keywords and phrases that are pertinent to the job opening that employers are looking to fill.\n\nTherefore, your executive-level resume has to be liberally, but naturally, filled with the right keywords and phrases to ensure that the robots pick it up and put it in the correct pile.\n\nTo do this, hunt out executive level jobs that appeal to you. Read the job description and the ideal candidate description, then, highlight the keywords and phrases that the recruiter has used.\n\nRepeat these words and phrases throughout your resume, but be sure not to overdo it. You want your resume to read naturally, not look as if it’s just an amalgamation of appropriate words.\n\n2. Clarify your work history\nThe type of jobs that you’re applying for will want to see on your resume that you have risen through the ranks, and gained the appropriate and necessary experience, to qualify you for that executive level job.\n\nTo demonstrate that you have this experience effectively, you will have to do the following for each position:\n\nInclude a brief overview of the role.\nSay why you were hired for this particular role, e.g., did you have specific experience or a certain skill set that made you stand out from the other applicants?\nIf you were hired to turnaround a team or resolve certain challenges, include the starting position and what your end result was.\nRemember to keep it brief and succinct. You only have two pages of A4 for your whole resume, so include the key details and refrain from being overly verbose. Use short, pithy sentences, with the main points bulleted for ease of reading and understanding.\n\n3. Go big early\nThe purpose of your resume is to match the criteria set to the resume-filtering robots, and secondly to pique the interest of the recruiter to get them to want to read the entire thing, and then invite you for interview to find out more.\n\nThe best way to hook their interest is to go big early. Don’t leave your huge achievements and key skills until midway through the third paragraph. Open your resume with them.\n\nIn your resume’s objective clearly state:\n\nWho you are.\nWhat you bring to the table, your experience, any big name companies you have worked for and any great successes you have had. Don’t shy away from your achievements, shout about them.\nWhat you type of executive-level job you are looking for.\n4. Focus on your leadership abilities\nBecause you’re applying for executive-level jobs, you have to clearly demonstrate that you have leadership abilities. No one wants to hire an executive and then hold their hand while they figure out what they are doing.\n\nMake it clear from the outset that you are a great leader. In your key skills section give examples of times when you were an effective leader and the outcomes you were able to produce.\n\nInclude any qualifications, hobbies, volunteering or personal experience that you may have that shows you’re not just a leader in work, but are a natural leader in life too.\n\nFinally, remember that your resume is the best version of you that you can be, so spell check, spell check and spell check it one more time.\n\nGetting your executive-level resume just right can be a challenge. To make the process easier, check out our professionally designed resume samples that can guide you in creating a standout job application.\n\nResume-Library is the fastest-growing job board in the U.S.  For more expert advice on job searches, careers, and the workplace, visit their Career Advice pages.","URL Slug":"how-to-tailor-your-executive-level-resume-for-a-jo"}}]}

Those who receive it certainly do. Do you know who else? The recruiters. \nPromotions serve as concrete evidence of your professional growth, exceptional performance, and the trust you've earned from previous employers. \nHowever, not all promotions are the same. And, accordingly, there isn't just one correct way of showing promotion on resume. \nRead on and find out:\nWhy you should show promotion on your resume;\nWhere on your resume you should mention promotion;\nHow to show promotion on resume; \nHow to show promotion on LinkedIn;\nExamples.\nLet's dive right into it!\nWhy you should show promotion on your resume\nAre you hesitant about including promotions on your resume? \nMaybe you think that showing off your promotions would be too braggy and you don't want to seem arrogant.\nOr maybe you think that it would take up too much of your precious resume space.\nWhatever the case may be, you'd be very wrong to leave any promotion out. \nHere is why you should always showcase promotion on your resume:\nPromotions reflect your career growth. And demonstrating career growth puts your ability to learn and pick up new skills into the spotlight. The ability to take on bigger responsibilities and manage more complex projects are key to succeeding in any industry.\nPromotions communicate your dedication to a company. Showing your career progression within the same company is a great way to let the recruiters know that you have the consistency and stability to remain with them for an extended period of time. Which they love coz it's cost-efficient.\nPromotions show that your work has been impactful. Show your potential employers that your hard work, skills, and especially results, have been noticed and awarded. This can also set you apart from other applicants who may have a similar level of experience but lack evidence of upward mobility. \nIn a nutshell, including promotions on your resume can effectively convey your potential value to your future employers.\nAnd in the current competitive market, this detail can make or break your chances of landing the job of your dreams.\nWhere on your resume should you show promotion?\nA straightforward question deserves a straightforward answer.\nShow you promotion in either:\nWork experience section (best option) OR\nResume summary\nWithout a doubt, the work experience section is the best of the resume sections to highlight your promotion. This makes the most sense, since promotions are inevitably linked to particular job positions. \nThere are more ways you can use the work experience section to highlight your promotion, which we discuss in the following chapter.\nHowever, it isn't the only place where you can drop this information. \nIf your promotion is something you're particularly proud of, you can also highlight it in your resume summary. \nYou can show your promotion in resume summary like so:\nResume summary with promotion example:\nA results-driven UX Designer with a proven track record of delivering user-centered designs and innovative solutions. Demonstrated exceptional performance, leading to a promotion within just seven months of joining my previous role. Skilled in creating intuitive, engaging user experiences that optimize user interaction and satisfaction. Adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams to translate business and user needs into practical design strategies.\nAdditionally, you can also make a note of your promotion in your cover letter.\nHow to show promotion on resume (3 cases)\nAs we've already mentioned, there isn't just one way of presenting your promotions. \nBelow, we've outlined 3 possible cases and explained in detail how to show promotion on resume in each case. \nYou'd been promoted to similar positions in the same company\nJunior UX Designer > UX Designer > Senior UX Designer\nYou'd been promoted to positions in different departments/teams in the same company\nContent Marketing Exec > UX Designer\nYou'd been promoted in different companies\nJunior UX Designer in company A > UX Designer in company B > Senior UX designer in company A\n#1 Case – You'd been promoted to similar positions in the same company\nLet's say you've been working in the same company for the last five years. You started out as a Junior UX Designer. Then, you'd been promoted to UX Designer. After additional two years, you've been promoted again – to a Senior UX Designer. \nYour career move took place within the same department and within the same company.\nWhat's changed?\nYour responsibilities haven't changed fundamentally.\nHowever, now you bear greater responsibility for the performance of the UX division as a whole.\nPlus, you're now in charge of more complex projects and lead a team of your own.\nHow to show promotion in this case?\nIf you've been promoted to positions with the same or similar competencies (within the same company!), you can showcase your progress by stacking all your job positions under one work experience entry. \nHere's how to do that:\nState the name of the employer once.\nStack job titles and respective dates of employment. Start with the most recent position, under the company's name.\nSummarize responsibilities and achievements. Here, you should focus primarily on the achievements and responsibilities pertaining to your latest position.\nHighlight the promotion. Finally, make a note of your promotion by indicating it directly in your descriptions and specify the reason or achievement that led to your promotion.\nHere's an example of the stacking format:\nABC Tech Solutions, London, UK\n– Senior UX Designer (January 2022 – Present)\n– UX Designer (June 2020 – December 2021)\n– Junior UX Designer (March 2018 – May 2020)\nLed a team of 5 designers to develop and implement user-centric web and mobile applications, enhancing user satisfaction by 30%.\nCollaborated with cross-functional teams on 15+ major projects\nStreamlined the design process by introducing agile methodologies, reducing project completion time by 20%.\nPromoted to Senior UX Designer for exceptional project management\nCase #2 – You'd been promoted to positions in different departments/teams in the same company\nIn this case, you've been working in the same company for the last five years. Throughout this time, you've held job positions in different departments. At first, you worked as a Content Marketing Executive.\nWhat's changed?\nYour responsibilities and competencies have changed significantly. In fact, you've undergone a complete career switch.\nYour new job position requires different skills and qualifications than the one before. \nHowever, you still want to show that you're capable of learning and expanding into new job positions if needed. Plus, the job posting you're about to apply to calls for a candidate with experience in both UX design AND Content Marketing.\nHow to show promotion in this case?\nIn case you've got experience working within the same company but in positions with different competencies, create separate job entries under the same company heading. \nHere's how to do that:\nState the name of the employer once.\nCreate a separate entry for you most recent position with respective dates.\nShowcase your most impactful accomplishments and key responsibilities – but only those pertaining to this particular job title!\nCreate another separate entry for the position you'd held before the promotion with respective dates. \nShowcase your most impactful accomplishments and key responsibilities – this time only those pertaining to the job position you'd held before the promotion. \n(Optional) If you've switched careers within the same company and the on top of that you were promoted in the new position, highlight the promotion.\nHere's an example of multiple job entries under one company heading:\nABC Tech Solutions, London, UK\n– UX Designer (December 2022 – Present)\nLed a team of 5 designers to develop and implement user-centric web and mobile applications, enhancing user satisfaction by 30%.\nCollaborated with cross-functional teams on 15+ major projects, ensuring seamless integration of UX design with technical functionality.\nPromoted to UX Designer for exceptional project management and a 30% increase in user engagement in key projects. \n– Content Marketing Executive (August 2019 – November 2022)\nDeveloped and executed a content marketing strategy that increased website traffic by 40% and social media engagement by 35%.\nCollaborated closely with the UX team to ensure content alignment with user experience goals, leading to a 25% increase in user interaction.\nConducted A/B testing on content layouts, resulting in more user-friendly navigation and a 20% increase in page dwell time.\n#3 Case – You'd been promoted in different companies\nLet's set the scene for the last case. You'd worked in company A as a Junior UX Designer for only 2 years. Then, you quit and landed a job in company B as a UX Designer. After two more years, you've returned into company A, but this time as a Senior UX Designer. \nWhat's changed?\nYour competencies and duties haven't changed significantly.\nYou now bear greater responsibility for the performance of the UX division as a whole.\nPlus, you're now in charge of more complex projects and lead a team of your own.\nHowever, this career advancement happened across two different companies.\nHow to show promotion in this case?\nAlthough this may seem as the most complicated situation out of the three, it can also be resolved by a very simple solution. \nBut, you'll need to list the same company twice. Here's how:\nMake a separate work experience entry for company A: Include the employer's name, location, your most recent job title and dates of employment. Then, proceed to mark your most relevant accomplishments in bullet points.\nMake a separate work experience entry for company B: Once again, state all relevant information about company B together with bullet points describing your competences. \nMake a separate work experience entry for company A: Here, you have to repeat all the employer's information. Describe the competencies and achievements pertaining to this particular job position.\nOn your resume, listing the same company twice can look like this:\nPromotion in two different companies example:\nABC Tech Solutions, London, UK\n– Senior UX Designer (January 2022 – Present)\nLed a team of 5 designers to develop and implement user-centric web and mobile applications, enhancing user satisfaction by 30%.\nCollaborated with cross-functional teams on 15+ major projects, ensuring seamless integration of UX design with technical functionality.\nStreamlined the design process by introducing agile methodologies, reducing project completion time by 20%.\nCreativeTech Solutions, Liverpool, UK\n– UX Designer (May 2020 – January 2022)\nLed the design of intuitive and engaging user interfaces for three major mobile applications, resulting in a 35% increase in user retention.\nConducted in-depth user research, including interviews and usability testing, to gather insights that drove the development of user-centric designs.\nCollaborated with cross-functional teams, including developers and product managers, to ensure seamless integration of UX design in product development, reducing project turnaround time by 25%\n ABC Tech Solutions, London, UK\n– Junior UX Designer (March 2018 – May 2020)\nCollaborated on the design of user-centric web and mobile applications, contributing to a 20% increase in user engagement for key projects.\nSupported senior designers in creating wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity mockups using tools like Sketch and Adobe XD.\nHow to show promotion on resume example\nLet's have a look at how to show promotion on a (kind of) real resume. We know that sometimes one picture is worth more than heaps of text.\nA fictional job seeker, Mary, had quite the career journey! She got promoted in two different companies.\nShe dedicated a separate work experience entry to each of these job titles.\nPromotion on resume example:\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nCreate resume\nWhat makes this resume example so good?\nShe includes the basic information about her former employers: name of the company, location, job title, and the dates. \nUses bullet points documenting her most impactful achievements and competencies under each entry.\nUses action verbs and quantifiers where possible.\nIs your LinkedIn profile done to perfection?\nConvert your painstakingly crafted LinkedIn profile into a stunning resume in seconds.\nImport LinkedIn profile\nHow to show promotion on LinkedIn\nNow that you know how to show promotion on resume, let's take a look at how to add promotion on LinkedIn profile in 7 simple steps:\nGo to your LinkedIn profile and scroll down to your Experience section.\nClick on the + icon next to your current job position. This will trigger a pop-up window.\nClick on Add position.\nFill in information about your new job title.\nIf you want to share your promotion with your network, switch the Notify network bar to On (the button will turn green).\nBefore clicking Save, tick the End current position as of now box. This will automatically add an end date on your former job experience entry. Finally, save your changes.\nIf you were promoted to a new job position within the same company, LinkedIn will add your new position under the same company's heading.\nKey takeaways: How to show promotion on resume (and LinkedIn)\nTo conclude, knowing how to show promotion in resume is crucial if you want to have that competitive edge over your fellow job applicants. \nPromotions demonstrate your career growth, adaptability, and the recognition you've received for your performance. Moreover, they highlight your ability to handle increased responsibilities and complex projects. All of this makes you more desirable in the eyes of the recruiters. \nThe three most common ways of showing promotion in resume include:\nStacking your job titles underneath one company heading. This approach is especially useful if you've been promoted to a position with similar/the same responsibilities and competencies within the same company. \nCreating separate job title entries under one company heading. Use this strategy if you've been promoted to a position with very different responsibilities within the same company. Each job title entry is accompanied by their own bullet points. \nListing the same company twice. When you left company A for company B, but later returned to company A to take a higher position."}}]}

That's no easy task.\nUnfortunately, hundreds of thousands of people will soon have to experience such hard-mode job hunt first hand.\nYes, it's still possible to find a job, even in a time like this. We've already talked a bit about that here, if you want to find out.\nFirst difficulties will probably appear as soon as you get to the nitty-gritty of job search. Is your resume supposed to be the same as usual? Should you adjust it to the current situation? How exactly do you do that?\nSure, at this point, we can only guess. But it's an educated guess. We hope it helps.\nLooking for a new job? Your resume is crucial\nThe market has pretty much shut down in many sectors because of the current situation with the virus. But we still need food, supplies, nurses, medical workers, public workers, or military.\nAlso, people are getting sick so businesses need replacements.\nTherefore, many companies are still hiring. However, searching for a job during the pandemic may be difficult.\nIf you need some help with navigating through your job search, check our guide: Job Search During the Coronavirus Outbreak? Difficult But Not Impossible\nBut there’s one more thing that you should prepare for your job search, other than yourself. Your resume. Here's how to update it:\n1. Address the elephant in the room\nDue to the layoff, you'll probably end up with an employment gap on your resume. Of course, you should minimise the gap as much as possible. We can’t be too picky during these times.\nBut it can take some time till you'll find new job prospects. What to do about it?\nBe honest. There’s nothing to be ashamed of. These are hard times and employers know it. Don’t hide the gap on your resume. Put a blurb in the job details about being laid off due to the COVID-19.\nBut don't leave it at that. Try to make the best of your employment gap. If you’ll spend this time doing meaningful activities, it’ll make your life a whole lot easier.\nMention how you used this time for self-development, whether it’s volunteering, doing online courses, certificates, and so on. Describe how it helped you to expand your skillset.\nOtherwise, recruiters might think that you spent this time vegging on your couch watching Netflix.\nKeep your job search going.\nGet hired with an outstanding resume.\nCreate resume\n2. Volunteer from self-isolation\nYou can help others even from self-isolation. Whether it’s taking care of vulnerable people, fundraising, creating an informative website about the coronavirus outbreak or helping as a remote crisis counsellor, put it on your resume.\nAll of these show that you’ve stayed proactive and developed a much broader vision of your life and work. Moreover, hiring managers love volunteers.\nYou can either include it under the work experience section or create a separate section dedicated to volunteer experience. Say how you contributed positively. List your key achievements.\nIn case you’re not yet involved in any volunteering, try to look for opportunities to support others. Many organisations are running various non-profit projects during the pandemic. Think about what do people need right now and how can you provide value at the greatest time of need.\n\n3. Boost your resume with a new skillset\nI know, having a spare time due to a job loss sucks. But you can use this time to your advantage. How? By expanding your skillset. Good thing is that there are loads of opportunities online.\nTake up online courses. Some of them are now being offered on discounted prices or even for free. Try LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, Udemy, or EdX. To help you get started, here’s a list of most valuable online courses.\nStart online tutoring. Over 30 million students are currently out of school due to the coronavirus. It’s boom time for online schools. Websites like Fiverr, Internshala, Vedantu, Upwork should help you.\nStart writing a blog. You can blog on Medium or create your own Wordpress website. The world has never been so attentive to online content like it is today.\nYou can also develop a new app or a new website. Try a new programming language. Learn Spanish. Simply focus on straightening your skillset. All of these will improve your resume.\n4. Focus on digital and technical skills\nMany companies are transitioning into remote work or working under reduced hours. Therefore, it will be extremely beneficial to focus on some digital and technical skills.\nHighlight how your skills will give you an advantage in such a work environment. The use of various communication tools such as MS Teams, Zoom and other technologies feature prominently in these current arrangements.\nAlso, if you have experience with remote work, make sure to include it in your skills. Not everyone is qualified, so it can boost your chances of scoring remote positions.\nHowever, don’t forget about soft skills as well. Emphasize your adaptability and openness to change. It is also good to highlight self-motivation skills as new circumstances call for significant amounts of unsupervised work. Also, high level or organisation and prioritisation will be highly appreciated.\nHighlight all of these skills in your resume, as recruiters will be searching for prospects who are well suited to working in challenging and unusual circumstances.\n\n5. Good references seal your reputation\nGenerally, it’s not very recommended to include references on your resume. But that doesn’t really apply to the current situation. What’s better during these times than having people who can vouch for you and provide your future employer with more information about your abilities?\nTry to obtain 3-4 professional references. Ask your former supervisors or employers, ex-colleagues, or advisors. These are the people who can confirm your qualifications and tell how you performed in your previous jobs or at school. If you’re not sure how to get references, check our article.\nYou can either put them directly on your resume or provide them as a separate document attached to your job application. Include reference's name, position, company, phone number or email address.\nHowever, be selective about who you will ask. Remember that you have to know your references well and be sure that they can give a good feedback.\n6. Go online (where recruiters are)\nPeople are now spending more time online and recruiting has shifted online too. Therefore, managing your online reputation has never been more important to your career than it is right now.\nHow to improve your online presence? Create a personal website. Just think of it as your online resume. Or a digital business card that will never get lost. Recruiters can easily find you, it helps you stand out and you’ll come across more professional.\nDon’t worry if you don’t have any HTML knowledge or advanced design skills. There are many template-based platforms out there that you can use. Check out Kickresume, WordPress, Weebly, Wix, or Squarespace. \n\nNot looking for a new job? You can still update your resume\nYou may ask yourself “Why should I update my resume when I’m not currently looking for a new job?”\nLet me explain. Firstly, you should update your resume every six to twelve months to add new skills and experiences, according to Monster career expert Vicki Salemi.\nSecondly, it’s very probable that your current work situation has also been affected in some way. You have more tasks due to the layoff of other employees, you're working remotely, or are involved in volunteering to help during the pandemic.\nAll of these things should be mentioned in your resume.\nAnd let's be honest – many of us don’t know how to pass the time during the quarantine. Let’s spend it meaningfully. Open that old document and get typing. Just follow these 4 quick tips:\n1. Talk about your remote work experience\nIf you’ve gone remote in your job, make sure that you note it on your resume. One way to improve your chances of landing remote work job in the future is showing that you can work remotely.\nNot only does it give a potential employer an overview of everything you did at the company, but it will also add more impact by showcasing that you can do it also while working remotely.\nThere are two ways to highlight your remote work experience – include it in the work description or in the skills section. What can you write there?\nIf you’re a leader, keep track of and update your resume with how you've kept your team, department, or company running.\nAs an IT specialist, you can mention how you’ve enabled your company’s workforce to go remote or go more remote and how quickly you did that.\nOr you can simply discuss how you managed your own remote work, what tools you were using, how you finished a 3-month project while working remotely, and so on. You get the idea.\n\n2. Give yourself credit for doing extra work\nLayoffs mean reduced workforces which means more work for you. Working from home could mean more work as well due to the fact that people tend to work overtime.\nUpdate your resume with ways you’ve picked up the slack at work.\nDoubling down the content, doing podcasts, planning webinars, pivoting your whole strategy in response to the crisis, fighting fires constantly? Give yourself credit for doing all of this extra work. You deserve it.\n3. Volunteer from self-isolation\nFollow the same tips as job seekers.\n4. Boost your resume with a new skillset\nFollow the same tips as job seekers.\n\nExtra tips and resources\nNow that we’ve covered some practical tips on updating your resume with coronavirus-related content, it's time to think about other parts of your resume.\nLet’s take it step-by-step.\nWhat sections should your resume include?\nImportant: Professional summary, Education, Employment history, Skills\nVoluntary: Hobbies, References, Awards and Achievements, Volunteer work, Social media\nHow to write your resume?\nAre you just updating your resume?

So how can you, a fresh graduate with no experience, stand out from the rest? Believe us, you can. \nWe'll show you how to highlight your skills and academic achievements, and other relevant experiences you might have, in a way that makes up for the lack of experience and catches an employer's eye.\nIn this article you'll find how to make an effective resume with no experience and land your first job. You'll also find out:\nIf you need a resume for your first job;\nHow to make a resume for first job in 6 steps;\nHow to know what is relevant;\nFirst job resume examples.\nBut let's start with the basics...\n\nWhat even is a resume?\nIn short, resume is a document which presents your career history in a succinct way. It provides an overview of your most relevant achievements (professional and educational):\nthe skills you've acquired; \nany qualifications, awards, or certificates you've gained; \nyour education;\nand work experience. \nStylistically speaking, resumes are formal, brief, and packed with information. \nThe aim of a resume is to present a summary of everything you need to convince the hiring managers that you are the right person to fill the open position in their company.\nWho is the resume meant for? \nThe target audience of your resume are the recruiters or the hiring manager. \nResume serves as the initial point of contact between you and the people who decide whether you get invited to a job interview. With a good resume, you can make a strong first impression which will get you on the list of promising candidates.\nRecruiters like brevity and efficiency, so make sure you communicate with them in clear and concise language.\nWhat does a resume consist of? \nGiven the volume of information included in a resume, you must organize it into appropriate and clearly distinguished resume sections. This will prevent your resume from looking cluttered and chaotic.\nGenerally speaking, there are two types of resume sections: necessary and optional.\nThe necessary resume sections include:\nPersonal/contact information\nResume summary or resume objective\nEducation\nWork experience\nSkills\nFrom the optional sections, the most frequent include:\nHobbies and interests\nAwards and achievements\nCertificates\nVolunteering\nReferences (though this one is mainly used in CVs, rather than resumes.)\nHow long should a resume be?\nChoosing the right resume length can be tricky, believe it or not. Luckily for you, there is only one correct answer. \nOur recommendation to keep your resume to only one page probably won't surprise you. \nDo you need a resume for your first job?\nAbsolutely. \nWhether it's your first or fiftieth time, you always need to attach a resume to your job application. \nYour resume is something like an ID card in the workforce – it tells people who you are, what you can do, and how they can reach you. Without a resume you won't get invited to a job interview; and without a job interview, well, you won't get a job. \nMaybe you feel that since you have no practical experience, writing a resume is pointless - this statement couldn't be further from true. \nAfter all, you would have to create a resume at one point in your life, so it may as well be now.\nThe simple fact of having a well-done resume already displays a certain level of professionalism and readiness for the workplace. \nKnowing how to best present yourself and your abilities – especially when you have no previous experience to vouch for them – is a skill in itself. And every skill needs practice. \nSo let's practise!\n\nHow to make a resume for your first job in 6 steps\nWriting a good resume for your first job can be intimidating; but following these 6 steps will make the process much easier.\nCreate a compelling resume objective.\nInstead of a resume summary, opt for a resume objective. In 3-5 sentences, focus on your career goals and academic achievements. Express your enthusiasm for the job, your goals, and your desire to grow professionally. \nFlash out your education.\nThis might be the most important section of your resume. Write your education entries in detail. You can mention relevant coursework, projects, or awards.\nCamouflage your work experience.\nIf you lack professional experience, you can build on your relevant internships, volunteering, independent projects, your teen jobs, summer jobs, or part-time jobs. Especially highlight those that are at least somewhat relevant for the job.\nShow relevant skills.\nHighlight hard skills, like languages, computer skills, or other tools. Also, don't forget to include soft skills, which are personality traits and are transferrable from your old jobs or school. You can also organize your skills section into smaller categories and use infographics.\nProvide up-to-date contact information.\nInclude your contact information in your resume header. Make sure they are clearly visible and easy to find with the first glance. Don't forget to include your LinkedIn profile.\nEnhance your resume with optional sections\nIf you feel that there's still relevant information to be mentioned, but you lack separate resume sections – create them. For instance, create a separate 'Independent Projects' section and boast about your endeavours.\nNow, let's go through these steps in detail.\nStep 1: Create a compelling resume summary/objective \nWhat is the purpose?\nWhat separates a good resume from a great one is its ability to immediately capture the attention of whoever is reading it. A nifty piece of text called a resume summary does the trick. \nThis brief text placed near the top of your resume, close to your contact information, condenses your resume highlights into 3-5 sentences. \nIt provides an overview of your most impressive professional qualities:\nMost significant achievements\nMost relevant skills\nExperiences that cater to specific needs of the job you want\nWhat can you do? \nObviously, you can't really do all that. But you can still create a persuasive short text that will make the recruiters keep on reading the rest of your resume. \nInstead of writing a resume summary, try to compose a resume objective. \nInstead of past experience and achievements, you can highlight your:\nCareer goals \nMotivation\nEnthusiasm to learn and grow professionally\nEducational achievements\nLook at this example:\n\nWhat makes this resume objective good?\nAnita shows the recruiters her qualifications by informing them of her bachelor's degree.\nShe states exactly what she can offer to her future employer: proactive approach, problem-solving, critical thinking. \nShe expresses her desire to “grow professionally”\nStep 2: Flash out your education\nWhat is the purpose?\nThe education section is where you list your degrees and your academic accomplishments. To be honest, candidates with years of professional experience need this section only as a way to show that they hold an academic degree. Simply because such is the convention. \nIn their case, an education entry contains the following:\nThe name of the institution\nLocation of the school\nYears of study\nLevel of study \nName of their degree\nWhat can you do?\nFor fresh graduates, the education section of a resume is often the most significant part. Make sure to put some meat on the bones … a lot of it actually.\nAt this point in your professional life, your academic achievements are probably the only way to showcase your most relevant abilities and substantial qualifications. Throughout your academic journey, you've likely gained and achieved a multitude of things, use this section to show your range. \nApart from the information shown above, you should elaborate on your education entries by detailing your:\nRelevant coursework. Being fresh out of school does have a certain advantage – all the theoretical knowledge is still in your head. \nFinal thesis. Your final thesis is the climax of your studies. It's by far your most elaborate project. It requires a lot of effort, good time management, dedication and long-term commitment – all the qualities highly desired by employers. Not to mention if the subject of your thesis directly links to the job you're applying for!\nExtracurricular activities. It's good to demonstrate your interest in things outside of the prescribed curriculum – this might suggest similar tendencies in work environment. \nProjects you've worked on. Apart from the knowledge, you've gained valuable teamwork experience.\nScholarships. \nAcademic awards. Make the recruiters recognize your hard work. \nGPA. Include it only if it's higher than 3.5.\nIn short, make note of every relevant information that will make your future employers see your potential.\nKeep in mind that your education entries should be listed in reverse-chronological order.\nConsider this example:\n\nWhat makes this education section good?\nBy mentioning the acknowledgements for her academic performance, Hannah shows the recruiters that she is focused, hard-working and consistent. \nHer membership in various societies and clubs suggest that she's developed strong communication and networking skills.\nStep 3: Camouflage your work experience.\nWhat is the purpose?\nNormally, the work experience section takes up the most space on a resume. It is here where candidates demonstrate their acquired skills and know-how with practical examples from real-life professional situations.\nWhat can you do?\nOne of the defining characteristics of those just entering the workforce, such as yourself, is the lack of practical work experience. \nThis doesn't have to mean that you have no experience whatsoever. \nInstead of dealing with this section in the traditional way, you can make for your lack of experience by focusing on:\nInternships. You can treat your internships as if they were regular jobs. In a few bullet points, note your responsibilities and accomplishments. Include any projects or studies you've participated in. What problems did you solve? What outcomes did you contribute to?\nIndependent projects. Feel free to add any kind of projects you've worked on. These can be academic, personal, work-related, freelance projects, etc. For instance, if you created a website for your college society, include this along with the transferrable skills you gained and a URL link.\nVolunteering. Volunteering is as valid as any other work experience. Just because something wasn't paid, doesn't mean that it didn't bring you anything valuable. Plus, if the company you're interested in shares your passion for volunteering, this can be your greatest weapon. \nPart-time jobs. What relevant tasks did you undertake? What were your responsibilities? \nIf you pick one, two, or combination of all – keep in mind that all the information on your resume should be relevant! This means that everything you decide to put on this document has to connect to the job you're applying for in some way.\nIf none of your experience aligns with the demands of your target job, you can still include it. Just make sure to focus on all the transferable skills you’ve gained because of it. \nHere is one example of how to deal with the feared “work experience” section:\n\nWhat makes this work experience section good?\nDespite not having any full-time experience, Nathan utilized his internship to the maximum. \nHe clearly states the competences and tasks he undertook.\nHe details the accomplishments and skills he employed with specific examples. \nTo make the text more readable and organized, he used bullet points and bold fonts. As a consequence, the whole entry feels less dense.\nStep 4: Show relevant skills\nWhat is the purpose?\nIt's quite straightforward, really – the skills section on your resume is there to highlight any skills that can help you get the job. \nYour abilities fall under one of two categories: hard or soft skills. \nHard skills are those you can obtain through education or training – they can be easily measured and quantified. The most prominent hard skills are:\nForeign language proficiency\nComputer skills (coding languages, spreadsheets, etc.)\nCompleted training (forklift operation, driving licence, etc.)\nSoft skills, on the other hand, aren't so easily defined. We can say that these are the interpersonal and social nuances one cultivates throughout years and years of experience. You can also know them under the term transferable. Some of the most sought-after soft skills include:\nCommunication skills\nProblem-solving skills\nLeadership \nTeamwork\nReliability\nTime management \nSince soft skills aren't strictly tied to a particular job position, you can apply them across all industries. Yes, even you.\nWhat can you do?\nAlthough both hard and soft skills can be included in the skills section, we recommend you to do this:\nUse the skills section to mark your hard skills. Since these can be objectively measured, you can mark down the level of your proficiency by using infographics. Your resume will be sleeker and visually more interesting. Add tools and software that you already have experience using and are relevant to the position you’re applying for. For example, a VoIP phone system, CRM platform, or call center software will be a huge plus for customer support roles, and keyword research and SEO tools will bring benefits if you’re applying for an SEO-related role.\nSprinkle your soft skills throughout other parts of your resume. Don't just write communication skills and blackout three out of five circles – that doesn't say much. We aren't saying that this is necessarily wrong; but you can do better!\nInstead of just writing teamwork, mention your participation in various projects when you talk about your education. \nDon't just write reliable, show how many responsibilities and competences you were able to handle during your internship.\nInstead of just writing leadership skills, mention the fact you led multiple group projects in your resume objective. \nLet's look at Anita's resume again. Focus on her skills section:\n\nWhat makes this skills section good?\nShe included hard skills only, which allowed her to include more of them. (all relevant to the job position though!)\nAnita organized her skills section into two categories. This made it more readable. \nBy including infographics, she elevated the overall look of her resume.\nStep 5: Provide up-to date contact information\nWhat is the purpose?\nA good resume is incomplete without your personal contact information. The recruiters need to know how to get in touch with you as soon as they look at your resume. Don't forget to clearly state your:\nFull name; \nemail address;\nphone number;\nand links to your LinkedIn, online portfolio of social media account (only if relevant!)\nWhat can you do?\nMake your contact info stand apart from the rest of the text. Place it in the topmost part of your resume (also called the resume header). \nYou can use a bigger font size to draw immediate attention to your name. \nAnd for the love of God, don't use unprofessional-sounding emails such as prettyboy@yahoo.com. \nStep 6: Enhance your resume with optional sections\nWhat is the purpose?\nOptional sections in a resume are those that are not essential but can be included to provide additional context about your skills, experiences, or personal interests. \nThese sections can be particularly useful for highlighting aspects of your profile that might not be evident from the standard sections.\nWhat can you do?\nWhen it comes to organizing your resume sections, there really is only one rule. The more important the information, the sooner it should be accessible. \nIf you want to draw the recruiters' attention to all the certificates you've gained – create yourself a stand-alone certificate section. \nMaybe you have both internship and volunteering experience, but you only went into detail on your internship – create a volunteering section. \nOr, you may want to create a separate Projects section where you provide links and descriptions of your independent endeavours you did as a freelancer or just for fun.\nYour additional section can look like this:\n\nWhat makes this example good?\nBy organizing all certificates under one section, you draw attention to your qualifications head on. \nEach certificate is explained in detail with 1-2 short sentences.\nIf you'd like some more inspiration, breeze through our resume samples and have a look at resumes that have actually helped our customers to land the job they'd wanted. \nHow to know what is relevant?\nCongratulations. Now you know how to make resume for first job. \nJust one more thing.\nIf you've read carefully you might've noticed how often the word relevant pops up in this post. (Could be a good drinking game actually.)\nBy relevant we mean pertaining to the job you're applying for. \nKnowing what your job demands allows you to tailor your resume to each job posting you wish to reply to. The closer your resume aligns with these requirements, the better chance to land a job interview you'll have.  \nGo to the job posting and read it again. Which key words and phrases catch your eye? \nIn this example, we've highlighted them for you: \nJob posting example:\n Entry-Level Customer Service Representative\nXYZ Tech Solutions is looking for a motivated Entry-Level Customer Service Representative to join our team in Miami, FL. The ideal candidate will have excellent communication skills, basic computer proficiency, and a strong command of both English and Spanish. This role involves addressing customer queries, solving problems with a proactive approach, and contributing to team efforts in a fast-paced environment.

If you’re passionate about delivering exceptional customer service and ready to grow your skills, apply now and kickstart your career with us!\nWhen constructing your resume, make sure that you've managed to tick as many boxes as possible. Just don't lie!\nHave a look at the following resume example.\nResume example for first job\nNow, let's have a look at a great example resume for first job belonging to a student intern.\nShe highlights her skills and education, effectively camouflaging the lack of work experience.\nShe makes use of the skills-based resume format, which focuses on your skills rather than professional experience – also a great way to make up for the lack of experience.\nThe best thing is you can use this resume as your first draft.\nStudent Intern Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse resume as your first draft\nKey takeaways: How to make a resume for first job?\nEven without formal work experience, a resume is crucial. It serves as the initial point of contact between you and potential employers.\nTo make your first resume land with a bang, follow these simple steps:\nCreate a compelling resume objective. Focus on career goals and academic achievements.\nFlash out your education. Highlight relevant coursework, projects, or awards.\nCamouflage your work experience. Utilize internships, volunteering, and part-time jobs to adequatly compensate for your lack of experience.\nShow relevant skills. Include both hard and transferabe skills. For better readability use infographics if possible. \nProvide up-to date contact information. Ensure it's up-to-date and prominently displayed.\nEnhance your resume with optional sections. Add any other relevant sections as needed.\nDon't forget the golden rule – always customize your resume to align with the specific job requirements, focusing on relevant skills and qualities.\nFinally, a good resume should always be accompanied by a good cover letter. It can lend you more space to show the recruiters your passion and personal motivation to work for their company. As a fresh graduate, this is how you write a cover letter with no experience.\nGood luck!","URL Slug":"how-to-make-a-resume-for-first-job-in-6-steps-(+-e","Meta Description":"Learn how to How to Make a Resume for First Job In 6 Steps (+ Examples) and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

In my case, it looked a bit like this:\n“What are the levels of language proficiency? Wow! Why are there so many language proficiency scales? And what the heck is ACTFL, ILR and CEFR? Okay, obviously I can’t describe my language skills in words. I’m going to use a star rating instead! What do you mean that ATS can’t read it? I give up.”\nAnyway, if you’re looking for a simple answer, you can find it in the next part of this article. Ultimately, you don’t have to understand every nerdy detail about language proficiency scales to produce a rock solid resume.\nBut if you’re willing to dig deeper, prepare for a really exhaustive answer that will explain all the abbreviations mentioned above! 🤓\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nHow to list language skills on a resume\nWhat are the levels of language proficiency?\nHow to correctly assess your level of language fluency? \nHow to put bilingual on a resume?\nExamples of language skills on resume\nHow to list language skills on a resume\nCreate a separate subsection for your language skills under your resume's skills section.\nOrder them by relevancy. Start with the language that is most relevant for the job you want. Don't include any languages in which you're not proficient, or any languages that you're only beginning to learn. \nFollow a single language proficiency scale. List all languages using one of the language proficiency scales described below (CEFR, ILR, or ACTFL). Pick the one that a potential employer is most familiar with and stick to it.\nUse words, not charts. Use words to describe your levels of language proficiency, not charts or icons. This will help your resume get score more points with ATSs (applicant tracking systems that large companies use to scan candidates).\nInclude certifications. If you took an exam and obtained a language certificate, include it in the certifications section of your resume. It gives a stronger backing \nBy following these simple steps you ensure that:\nthe language skills on your resume don’t go unnoticed (they’ve got their own subsection)\nyour strongest skill gets the attention it deserves (it sits at the top)\nand you don't confuse the employer by coming up with your own unfamiliar names for the levels of language proficiency. \n\nWhat are the levels of language proficiency?\nWelcome to the most confusing part of this article! Why confusing, you ask?\nBecause there are multiple language proficiency scales (of course there are). What’s more, each of them uses different letters and numbers to describe the same thing.\nFortunately, you only need to know about three of them: IRL, ACTFL, and CEFR. \nAlso, if all of this sounds intimidating, don’t worry too much. Remember, your main priority is to create a resume that clearly communicates your ability to use multiple languages professionally.\nAs long as you succeed in that, everything’s going to be all right, all right, all right.\nOkay, then. Let’s take a look at those different levels of language fluency.\n\n1. ILR (Interagency Language Roundtable)\nThe Interagency Language Roundtable scale is the standard grading scale for language proficiency developed by the United States’ federal-level service. \nBecause of that, it’s most commonly used in the USA, or more specifically, when applying for US government jobs. \nAnd that’s probably everything that needs to be said about this scale. The rest you should be able to understand from the helpful comparison table above.\nThe ILR scale grades people’s language skills on a scale of 0–5 (5 being Native). In addition to that, it uses 0+, 1+, 2+, and 4+ to address those situations when a person’s language proficiency exceeds one skill level but doesn’t meet the criteria for the next level yet. \nThe ILR scale corresponds to the language levels used on LinkedIn.\n2. ACTFL (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages)\nThe ACTFL scale was developed from the ILR scale but it’s more granular with 11 grades of language proficiency instead of 6. According to the ACTFL website, it’s “intended to be used for global assessment in academic and workplace settings.”\nCompared to the ILR, it can be a lot easier to understand even for people who couldn’t care less about language proficiency grades.\nWhich of the following is easier to decipher? “French: 4+ (ILR)” or “French: Advanced High (ACTFL)”.\n3. CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages)\nIn Europe, we use the CEFR. This language proficiency scale is not derived from either of the American scales mentioned above, which is why it can be harder to convert grades from one into the other (that is officially). \nThis scale is universally understood in Europe and almost every European employer will know exactly what you mean by, for example, B2 Spanish. \n4. LinkedIn language skills levels\nLinkedIn uses the ILR language proficiency scale but instead of using numbers, they came up with their own wording for the individual ranks.\nBecause of that, you may want to determine your IRL language skill level before adding it to LinkedIn. \nWhich language proficiency scale should you use on your resume?\nAlways use the one that your future employer is most familiar with. But how do you know which one is it? \nAs usually, start with the job advertisement and look for the words they use to describe the required level of language proficiency.\nUse the same words to describe your language skills in your resume (provided your skills are on that level).\n\"¿Buscar...trabajo?\"\nCreate a great resume whether you know the language or not.\nCreate resume\nHow to correctly assess your level of language fluency? \nIf you don't know your exact language skills levels, don't guess.\nEither you'll overestimate your abilities (which can lead to many uncomfortable situations in the future) or you'll underestimate yourself (which may sabotage your effort to show yourself in the best possible light on your resume). \nWhat are your options then? \nObtain an official language certificate. This often takes a lot of work and preparation but it can be worth it. It gives you a way to back your claims about your language skills levels and can make a stronger impression on the employer. On the other hand, sometimes it's simply an overkill. What's more, it can get pretty expensive, especially if you speak multiple languages and want to obtain an official certificate for each.\nSelf-assess your language skill level. In most cases, self-assessment should suffice, as long as you don't try overestimate your abilities and follow official guidelines to grade yourself. \nThe official IRL website offers self assessment PDFs for speaking, reading, and listening.\nThe Council of Europe website provides official CEFR self assessment charts in most European languages. \nThe ACTFL website lets you download the complete text of the ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines. It's from 2012 but these things only get updated ever 10 years.\nIf you're looking for a less exhaustive version, this downloadable poster should give you all the information you need.\n\nHow to put bilingual on a resume?\nWhat does it mean to be bilingual? By the most basic definition, a bilingual person is someone who speaks two languages. \nBut in order to be considered bilingual, you're usually expected to speak both languages really well in addition to having error-free grammar and perfect pronunciation.\nMost people are able to achieve such level of language proficiency only by being born into linguistically mixed families or receiving formal education abroad. \nDon't be afraid to describe your language skills as near native.\nBut there are also people who have been studying a second language for decades. Their command of language often surpasses that of many born speakers. What about them?\nIf that's your case, don't be afraid to describe your language skill as \"near native\". You won't be lying and it will help you get through various applicant tracking systems.\nBut don't just mention it in the language skills subsection of your resume. The competitive advantage of being bilingual is so big that you may want to mention it right at the beginning of your resume — in your resume summary (or resume objective) section. \n\nChristy's word of advice\nThe most common internationally-understood format is to list the language and overall proficiency level. For example: German (native), English (fluent). In general, I recommend writing the level in words rather than a specific scale (e.g. B1 is known in Europe, but not in the US). Regarding graphs or icons, ATS can struggle to interpret these, and some graphs can be perceived negatively, so in general it’s better to use a common format.\nChristy Morgan, Resident HR Expert\nExamples of language skills on resume\nAs they say, one example is often worth a thousand explanations!\nBecause of that, let me give you a couple of examples you can use as an inspiration for the language skills section on your own resume. \nILR language skills resume example 1\n• American English — Level 4+ (ILR)\n• Chilean Spanish — Level 3+ (ILR)\n• Russian — Level 3 (ILR)\n• Ukrainian — Level 5 (ILR)\nILR language skills resume example 2 / LinkedIn language skills\n• English — Full Professional Proficiency (ILR 4+)\n• French — Native (ILR 5)\nACTFL language skills resume example\n• American English — Distinguished (ACTFL)\n• Spanish — Full Professional Proficiency (ACTFL)\n• Japanese — Advanced High (ACTFL)\nCEFR language skills resume example\n• English — C2\n• German — B2\n• Czech — Native\n(Contrary to the previous ones, in the last example we didn't specify the language framework in parentheses. CEFR is so prevalent in Europe that you rarely have to do that.)\nCreate and edit your resumes on the go.\nGet a Kickresume mobile app. Scan the QR code or click the button below to download.\nGet Kickresume mobile app\nPro at listing language skills on your resume now?

Furthermore, they often come with the possibility to advance into management and even ownership positions in the company.\nFrom financial analysts to graphic designers, IT engineers and marketing experts — the automotive sector is rife with opportunities for everyone. So if you're all into cars and transportation and feel like your career is on cruise control, perhaps it’s time to hit the brakes on the mundane and start looking for a new job.\nTaking a plunge into an ever-evolving industry at the forefront of innovation may be difficult. But definitely not as hard as parallel parking or keeping your cool in rush-hour traffic.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nCars and carmakers\n1. Resume summary \n2. Work experience \n3. Education and licenses\n4. Skills \nCars and carmakers\n77 million cars are expected to be sold around the world by the end of 2019, according to Statista. With over 17 million vehicles sold every year, the United States is one of the largest automotive markets in the world. So, there's no reason to expect a shortage of jobs.\nThanks to the open investment policy, a large consumer market, a highly skilled workforce, available infrastructure, and local and state government incentives, many global car companies are choosing the US for their engine and transmission and for their R&D, design and testing. \nAnd what about the employees? The average salary of an automotive service technician is over $40,000 per year. But top technicians can make north of $100,000 per year. And we're still not even talking about managers.\nVroom, vroom.\nCross the finish line with the best resume.\nCreate resume\nAll of these speak about the fact that the auto industry is alive and kicking. And that's pretty fantastic news for both the employers and employees.\n\n1. Resume summary \nMany people omit the resume summary from their resumes. That's a missed opportunity.\nYour resume summary is your digital handshake. In just a few sentences, it gives you a chance to pitch yourself in an attention-grabbing and persuasive way.\nYou want to come up with a paragraph that's 3–5 sentences long. It should state who you are, what you do and what makes you different. It should look like this:\nResume summary example\nPerformance-driven and hard-working Automotive Technician with a proven track record of success in repairing various cars and trucks, inspecting emissions control systems, and maintaining a safe work area. Offers strong attention to detail and accuracy and determination to complete all projects within budget and schedule. Possessing excellent problem-solving skills, Simons is presently seeking an Automotive Technician job.\nIf you need some inspiration, here's our list of 200 powerful adjectives that will help you breathe life into your automotive resume.\n2. Work experience \nUndoubtedly, your former jobs have made you who you are today. You've gained valuable practical experience and insight. Let recruiters see that.\nTo help them navigate the section, list your work history in reverse chronological order. The most recent — and the most relevant — items should be placed at the top.\nHowever, you shouldn't just state where you worked at and what was your job title. Use 3–6 bullet points for each job to detail your duties and specific achievements. Here's an example:\nWork experience example\nAutomotive Technician, Icahn Automotive, Rotorua, New Zealand (03/2017 – 09/2019)\n• Repaired various cars and trucks. Troubleshot and diagnosed vehicles. Repaired or replaced defective parts. Ensured that everything was in compliance with the company’s high standards and clients’ needs.\n• Awarded Employee of the Month for increasing customer satisfaction with provided services from 87% to 95% within one year.\nAre there any employment gaps on your automotive resume? In this case, consider using alternative resume formats such as a functional or a hybrid resume.\n\n3. Education and licenses\nSome specialised jobs in the auto sector require you to have a university degree. Some employers may even request that you include a GPA in your resume. If that's your case, learn more about how to exactly put GPA on your resume.\nHowever, most of automotive jobs are suitable for high school and vocational school graduates.\nIn 2018, there was about 770,100 auto technicians and mechanics in the workforce (according to The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports). More than 50% of them were required to have at least a high school diploma. And more than 75% only had to go through an on-the-job training.\nNaturally, you don't have tons of experience if you've just finished school. However, this is not a reason to despair.\nThink of any job-relevant experience that you could put on your automotive resume. Have you volunteered at your uncle's workshop? Attended a conference? Spent several weeks interning at Porsche?\nThese valuable information can help your future employer better assess your career prospects. Professional licenses like an ASE certification also belong here:\nEducation and licenses example\n• Engineering and Technology, Eastern Latvia Technology High School (09/2013 – 05/2017)\n‣ Graduated with Distinction (Top 10% of the Program)\n• Master of Science in Engineering, Lund University, Sweden (2017 – 2019)\n‣ Subjects included: Real-time systems, Applied mechatronics, Applied Machine Learning, Applied Artificial Intelligence (Starting January 2019), Multivariable control, Nonlinear control and servo systems, Project in automatic control, System Identification, Predictive control. This education gave me an understanding of different strategies of control systems, and how they are related to mechatronics systems and AI.\n• ASE Auto Mechanic Certification, Automotive Mechanic Training School (10/2018)\n\n4. Skills \nMake sure to tailor your resume to every position you're applying for. Include the most important keywords that you'll find in the job description.\nLet's say you're after an automotive technician job. In this case, you should draw attention to your mechanical knowledge and diagnostic abilities.\nWhat's more, an automotive engineer's resume should highlight the applicant's education, modeling skills and his knack for innovation.\nFirst things first. Start out by creating a generic resume that will be a compilation of all your skills, work experience and education. And then — each time you come across a promising job offer — create a copy of your master resume and modify it to reflect the job posting.\nTop soft skills in automotive\n• Teamwork and social skills\n• Time-management, planning and scheduling skills\n• Strong critical thinking and problem-solving\n• Attention to detail and record-keeping skills\n• Outstanding diagnostic ability\n• Organised and efficient\n• Physical endurance\nTop hard skills in automotive\n• In-depth understanding of automotive internal systems\n• Familiarity with safety protocols and automotive service procedures\n• Proficiency with digital databases, work-order management software and technical manuals\n• Knowledge of engineering and mechanical principles\n\n5 winning automotive resume examples to speed up your job search\nFinally, let's put the theory into practice.\nHere's a collection of 5 well-written automotive resumes. They'll help you get an idea of how other professionals landed their dream jobs and see how you can score yours, too.\n1. Volvo Mechanical Engineer Internship Resume Example\nThis is a superb resume example for recent graduates and young aspiring professionals. If you've just finished school and lack solid hands-on experience, make your academic career the first thing recruiters will see on your resume. \nSpeaking of formatting, it should always serve a purpose. Bullet points are particularly useful when you need to create lists or want to present short bits of information. Full sentences, on the other hand, are handy when you want to make a story unfold or need to provide an explanation.\nMechanical Engineering Intern at Volvo\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n2. Uber Test Autonomy Analyst Automotive Resume Example\nSeasoned professionals can use up more than one page on their resume to present their extensive work experience in chronological order. But this doesn't mean that you should let your resume become a 700-page long autobiography. \nIf something's recent it also means it's more relevant. That's why you should give more attention to more recent jobs. Older ones will do with a brief description, enabling you to save some valuable space for more important details to put on your resume.\nUber Test Autonomy Analyst\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n3. Yamaha E-Commerce Executive Resume Example\nYour profile summary should answer three essential questions:\nWho you are — \"A highly motivated e-commerce professional\" \nWhat you do and for how long — \"4+ years of work experience in online sales and business development\"\nWhy you're special — \"Successful track record of expanding the business through various channels\"\nDon't forget to use action verbs in the past tense throughout your Work experience section. They'll help you highlight your job responsibilities. If you planned on using personal pronouns, it's better to leave them out.\nDeveloped. Delivered. Maximised. Managed. Grew. Monitored. Researched.\nAlso, list your transferable skills in Skills or in a separate Core competencies section. If you're unsure which soft skills to include, try to mirror the job description. This way you'll make the ATS recognise you as a fitting job applicant that matches the requirements.\nYamaha E-commerce Executive\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n4. Porsche Holding HR Manager Automotive Resume Example\nThis resume is a proof that even the most minimalist career documents can help you make a good impression and land a high-profile job.\nAbove all, a good resume is clean, simple, and easy to read. It follows conventions and uses standard fonts such as Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri. \nAll content, except for headers, should be one font size. But don't be afraid to use bold whenever you want to highlight section headers or important bits of information within paragraphs.\nHuman Resource Manager at Porsche\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n5.

This Is the Magic Number\n\nDo you know how many skills to list on resume? Since you're currently reading this article, you must've been wondering about this too. \nOn one hand, you need to ensure you list enough relevant skills to show hiring managers you can handle the job's responsibilities.\nOn the other hand, you need to keep the number of listed skills reasonable while not selling yourself too short. Since your resume shouldn't exceed one page, brevity is key. \nIn a nutshell, you can include anywhere between 5-15 skills on your resume overall, depending on where you currently are in your career (and your industry). But, there's a \"but\".\nIn this article you'll find:\nWhy it's important to include skills on resume;\nWhere to put skills on your resume;\nHow many skills to list on resume;\nHow to know which skills to list;\nBest skills to include for 7 different job positions.\nWhat are skills on resume?\nPut simply, skills stand for specific abilities and expertise you, as a potential employee, bring to the table.\nNevertheless, skills are not homogeneous and can be further divided into two basic categories:\nSoft skills\nHard skills\nBoth types of skills are necessary to be considered a well-rounded, and therefore desirable, employee. \n1. Soft skills\nSoft skills, also known as transferable skills, are the non-technical skills that relate to how you work and interact with your colleagues, clients, or customers.\nFor these reasons, soft skills are often referred to as interpersonal skills – and are closely tied to your personal traits (your behaviour, emotional intelligence, your attitude).\nSoft skills are increasingly sought after by employers in every industry. A Harvard study shows that more than 80% of success in one's career is determined by their soft skills. \nThese are some of the most desired soft skills in an employee according to research: \nCommunication\nWillingness to learn\nTeamwork\nLeadership\nProblem-solving\nFriendliness\n2. Hard skills\nBy comparison, hard skills are very specific, teachable and easy to measure. \nHard skills are related to technical competencies required in a specific job or industry.\nRecruiters often list them directly in job postings to make it clear what technical knowledge of proficiencies you need to be considered for that particular job position. \nYou can acquire them through education, training programmes, certifications, or other forms of training.\nHard skills can be further divided into several subcategories, such as:\nLanguage proficiencies (CPE, DELF, IELTS, DSH,…)\nComputer skills (Microsoft Excel, Adobe Photoshop, HTML, Python, …)\nFinance and accounting skills (QuickBooks, SAP, tax preparation, bookkeeping, …)\nMarketing and social media skills (SEO, PPC, CMS, …)\nTrade skills (welding, plumbing, carpentry, …)\nIf you want to expand your skill set or change careers, these 9 high-income skills can help you find your new calling.\nWhy is it important to include skills on your resume?\nApart from your previous work experience, the skills section is what most attracts recruiters' attention. This is because your skills serve as the representation of what you can actually do.\nIn recent years, there's been an interesting development in hiring trends. More and more companies seem to favour skills-first recruiting process over the traditional credentials-based one. \nThis means that recruiters no longer consider university degrees or years spend in the workforce as the most telling indicators of a candidate's potential.\nInstead, their focus gradually shifts towards, you guessed it, the applicant's skills.\nMoreover, showcasing your skills on resume can directly influence how far down the hiring process you'll get. After all, who wants to hire a person who has nothing to contribute to their company?\nFail to list your skills, and your chances at landing a job interview will shrink to smithereens. \nWhere to place skills on your resume?\nWhen it comes to marking down your skills, there are 4 ways of how to approach this issue. \nIt's important to note that these are NOT mutually exclusive. On the contrary, the best resumes use a combination of all of the following:\nDedicated skills section. This is, by far, the most obvious strategy. Create a separate section on your resume under the heading “skills” and simply list all your relevant skills there. For better readability, you can also group your skills under more specific subheadings (language skills, computer skills, coding skills, …).\nCertifications. When you're trying to fit your resume to one page, every inch of space is precious. If you decide to include a “Certificates” section on your resume, consider if it's necessary to repeat certain skills in the “Skills” section to avoid redundancy. For instance, if you include your CPE under “Certificates”, you don't have to mention English proficiency again in your “Skills”.\nSkills mentioned in resume summary/objective. If the job posting you're responding to puts extra emphasis on certain skills, consider including those in your resume summary – since the summary sits at the very top of your resume.\nSkills embedded into work experience. Finally, you can weave your skills into bullet points describing your work experience entries. This is especially fitting if you want to display your soft skills more organically. For example, instead of putting “leadership” under the “Skills” heading, you can mention that you've “Led the successful launch of a new product line while coordinating cross-departmental teams.”\nHow many skills to list on resume?\nHow many skills you list on a resume varies depending on several factors, such as how far along you are into your career journey and the industry you work in. \nThat's why, unfortunately, we can't give you any magical one-size-fits-all answer. \nFor example, a full-stack web developer is expected to have a greater number of hard skills compared to a PR representative. But, a PR representative must possess a greater number of soft skills than a full-stack web developer.\nFurthermore, the number of skills on your resume will naturally evolve together with your career path: \nEntry-level position. As a workforce novice, you probably don't have all that many skills yet. We recommend focusing on your core 5-10 skills. If you think this number is too low, don't panic. For entry-level positions, employers look for candidates with only fundamental skills in any given field. The skills you've picked up during your studies, internships, or personal projects will do just fine. \nMid-level position. For a mid-level job, you should list around 8-15 skills on your resume. At this stage in your career, you already have a more defined set of technical hard skills. Plus, you've already developed a solid number of soft skills too.\nSenior level position. Lastly, for a senior-level position, list no less than 10-15 skills. At the managerial level, your soft skills became the main focus. When curating skills for a senior-level resume, prioritize those that highlight your expertise in leadership, strategic planning, management, complex problem-solving, and industry-specific knowledge. \n\nResume hack: Skills-based resume\nIf you want to position your skills front and centre, consider switching your traditional chronological resume for a skills-based resume. \nUnlike chronological resume, skills-based resume places your “skills” section at the very top of the page, forcing the “education” and “work experience” sections to take the back seat. \nThis resume format is best suited for those who lack a continuous, long-term work experience in a specialized position. In other words, for fresh graduates, career changers, or those who lack relevant work experience. \nHowever, if the company you're applying for uses Applicants Tracking System, refrain from using a skills-based format. Some ATSs can't read resume formats other than the traditional one. Consequently, your resume could be discarded without ever reaching the recruiters' eyes. \nBelow, you can see what a skills-based resume (also known as functional resume) can look like:\nSkills-based resume example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nHow to know which skills to list on resume in 5 steps\nEvery single resume you send must be tailored to specific job description. This rule applies to your skills too. \nHere is a simple 5-step guide to help you decide which skills to highlight on your resume:\n(Re)read the job posting.\nGo back to the job description and read it thoroughly. Focus on sections describing the role, requirements, and responsibilities.\nHighlight any skills that pop up.\nIf some of them come up 2 or more times throughout the job posting, take a special note of them. These are the key skills the recruiters are looking for and you should absolutely have them on your resume.\nMatch the required skills to yours.\nWhich of the required skills do you actually have? Certainly, you could lie, but believe us, it's not worth it. Sooner or later, the truth will come out. Recruiters have a way of probing all information on your resume.\nIncorporate your skills throughout the resume.\nNow it's time to decide where to place your skills. Which of them can you incorporate into other resume sections? Do any of them fit in your work experience description? Will you create a separate skill section? And, don't forget to also mention key skills (those reoccurring in your job posting) straight in the resume summary.\nMake sure to use precise wording.\nThis has to do mainly with the use of ATS. These software programmes are designed to scan an applicant's resume and extract information from it in the form of specific keywords. In order to make an ATS-friendly resume, you must word and spell your skills precisely as they appear in the job posting. If not, the ATS may not recognize the presence of the skills on your resume and, as a consequence, will mark them as absent. This may cost you precious points. \nDoes your resume list the right skills?\nFind out how good your resume really is with our AI Resume Checker.\nCheck my resume\nBest skills to put on a resume for different job positions\nThe number and nature of skills that should feature on your resume changes from profession to profession. \nIf you're in a situation where you need a bit of inspiration, this subchapter may be helpful to you. \nBelow, you'll find 7 resume samples which were created by real people (with the exception of the first resume) who managed to get hired by companies worldwide. \n1.

Lastly, for a senior-level position, list no less than 10-15 skills. \nHowever, these numbers can change in relation to specific job position and industry requirements. \nWhen it comes to the question of where to place skills on your resume, you have several options that you can combine:\nDedicated skills section. \nSkills embedded into work experience.\nSkills mentioned in resume summary/objective. \nCertifications.","Meta Description":"Learn how to How Many Skills to List on Resume?

Spoiler: There Is an Ideal Number\n\nIs it really important to know how many bullet points per job on resume is the ideal?\nHow many bullet points are too many? Or too few?\nWell, since your resume is supposed to be only one page long, there is, indeed, a consensus.\nSpoiler alert: The ideal number of bullet points per job on a resume is somewhere between 3-6, depending on several factors.\nIn this article, we cover:\nWhy you should use bullet points on your resume;\nHow many bullet points per job on resume & what it depends on;\nWhat should your bullet points say;\nAnd, a (not so secret) resume hack.\nWhy you should use bullet points on your resume\nCrafting a great resume is all about including the right information and presenting it the right way. \nAnd, to this effect, bullet points can prove useful on several fronts: \nThey improve readability by breaking the text down into smaller chunks. Who wants to read solid walls of text? Certainly not the recruiters! In fact, dense paragraphs are some of the most effective recruiter repellents. \nThey encourage you to use your resume space effectively. With bullet points, there's no room for flowery descriptions or unnecessary words. Consequently, they force you to think twice about which information truly adds value to your resume. \nThey give your resume a professional look. Aesthetics-wise, nothing beats an easy-to-read and structured layout. \nThey are universal. Lastly, apart from your work experience, you can use bullet points to describe your education, volunteering, or awards. \nWant a stunning resume in seconds?\nSpeed up your resume creation with our AI resume builder. It’s free to try!\nTry AI resume writer\nWhat information should your bullet points contain?\nNow what is it exactly that these bullet points should say? Well, there's a clear answer to that as well.\nWhen it comes to content, we can distinguish between two types of information in bullet points:\nThe most common tasks and responsibilities pertaining to a job.\nThe most significant accomplishments achieved during your tenure.\nFirstly, you should reserve only 1 bullet point to describe the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities connected to a specific job. This is to provide the necessary context for the recruiters.\nSecondly, your most significant accomplishments should make up the remaining bulk of the bullet points. The employers are interested in seeing specific examples of what you've achieved in your previous job. And, in turn, this will give them an idea of what you can potentially bring to their table!\nThese 'accomplishments' bullet points should be structured like so:\nSpecify the accomplishment. \nWrite about what action you took.\nPoint out the result of your actions. \nTo see what bullet points can look like on a resume, take a look at the example below:\nBullet points on resume example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nHow many bullet points per job on resume?\nYes, we did say that the ideal number of bullet points ranges between 3-6.\nHowever, that doesn't automatically make it the right number for every single work experience entry on your resume. \nBefore putting the pen to paper (metaphorically), you want to consider these factors:\nHow recent a job entry is. The golden rule is – the more recent the job, the more bullet points you should use. \nHow relevant the job entry is. What if your latest job has very little in common with the position you're applying to, while the one before that has a lot? In that case, relevancy supersedes recency. \nThe number of accomplishments pertaining to a single job entry. Were you extra diligent and managed to achieve more than 6 significant milestones? Don't be afraid to add the 7th! And 8th. And … Well, you get the gist.\nThe number of job entries on your resume. If you've worked at multiple positions with the same/similar responsibilities, focus mainly on one (ideally the most recent) and the rest will do with just 2-3 bullet points. \nAlso, avoid listing less than 2 bullet points in a job entry. It makes the job entry look incomplete and, well, bad.\n\nQuick tips to make your bullet points memorable\nBefore we say goodbye, we have a few more recommendations up our sleeve:\nUse numerical quantifiers to drive home your point. Concrete numbers make your achievements feel more real. \nStart your bullet points with a strong action verb. \"I have been a part of the employee performance evaluation process.\" Instead: \"Evaluated employee performance using available data.\"\nAvoid using filler words (such as I, we, they're, actively, frequently, ...). According to our resume statistics, up to 44% of resumes are needlessly riddled with fluff that doesn't add any value.\nSprinkle your bullet points with keywords. Take this opportunity and make your resume ATS-friendly by incorporating keywords into your bullet points.\nAll things put together, your bullet points can look something like this:\nBullet point example\nRevitalized underperforming product sales by analyzing market trends, resulting in a 50% sales increase in six months.\nResume hack: Using AI resume writer\nLastly, if you still struggle to figure out what to write into your bullet points, don't get yourself worked up!\nInstead, save yourself the time, and nerves, and use an AI resume writer to assist you. It can generate bullet points to go with your job experience entry in a few seconds. \nAnd it's easier than you'd think – here's a simple step-by-step:\nFirstly, sign up or log in to your Kickresume account. When logged in, on the dashboard scroll down to Your Documents and click on Create New.\nWhen filling in the Work Experience section, enter your job title, click “Use AI Writer” and the AI will generate a number of bullet points for your work experience subsection.\nThen if you don't like these bullet points, you can either edit them or delete them and click the button again.\nFinally, if you like the bullet points but feel like that section is still too short, simply click the button again and the AI will add more phrases to it.\n\nKey takeaways: How many bullet points per job to include on resume?\nBullet points enable you to condense your job experience descriptions into more digestible sections.\nTherefore, they are indispensable in making your resume professional, brief, and laser focused. \nHere's a rundown of our tips:\nUse 3-6 bullet points per job entry, focusing on readability and relevance.\nStart with action verbs and use numerical quantifiers to make your bullet points more impactful and memorable.\nTo make your resume ATS-friendly, incorporate keywords into your bullet points and avoid unnecessary filler words.\nFinally consider using AI tools for crafting compelling bullet points, saving time and enhancing quality."}}]}

(And How to Make It Fit One Page)\n\nHow long should a resume be? You must've wondered about this at some point in your life. Let us assure you, you're not the only one. \nThe golden rule is to keep your resume to a one-page format – concise, focused, and easily digestible. But, as it's often the case, nothing is set in stone. \nThe length of your resume depends greatly on a number of factors, such as: where you are in your career; or which field you wish to make your career in. \nIn this article, we answer the following questions:\nHow many pages should a resume be?\nCan a resume be 2 pages?\nHow far back should a resume go?\nHow to make a resume fit one page?\nBut first...\nWhat is a resume? \nThe chances are, you most likely know the answer to this question. But just in case, let's refresh your memory. \nA resume is the most important element of any job application. It is the initial point of contact between you and the recruiters. \nResume offers prospective employers a brief overview of your career history. It showcases your professional background and skill set by providing a concise summary of:\nWho you are as a professional;\nYour work experience (accompanied by descriptions of your responsibilities and achievements); \nYour education;\nAny relevant skills you possess (including certifications, awards, or other acknowledgements). \nThe tricky part is finding the right means of presenting all this information in a clear, organized, and professional manner.\nOne way to achieve this is to make sure your resume has the right length.\nHow many pages should a resume be?\nGiven all the information your resume needs to communicate to the recruiters, you might ask yourself: “Should resume be one page?”.\nYour resume needs to hit the sweet spot. Long enough to highlight your achievements and skills, yet concise enough to keep recruiters engaged. It’s a delicate balance.\nAs far as the general consensus goes, keeping your resume to only one page seems to be the best way of achieving this balance.  \nThis overwhelming preference is mainly due to a very pragmatic reason – it saves time. And time is a precious commodity. Why?\nBecause recruiters spend about 6 seconds on each application. \nOn average, hiring managers are said to need only 6 seconds to determine whether you'd be a good fit for their company or not. \nIn this brief moment, a recruiter scans for key info: your past jobs, education, and skills that match the job they're trying to fill. This is why having a resume that's clear, to the point, and well-organized is indispensable. \nIf you don't have your resume yet, visit our AI Resume Writer which can automatically generate the entire resume for you. It'll take only a few seconds.  \nCan a resume be 2 pages?\nAs we've said, a one-page resume is the standard. But that doesn't mean that you can't deviate from this standard and still succeed. In fact, there are cases where choosing a two-page format would be more fitting. \nOne way to find out if a two-page resume is the way to go for you is to look at where you currently are in your career. Different stages call for a different approach to resume length. \nWhich category do you belong to?\nEntry-level (0-2 years of experience)\nMid-level professional (3-10 years of experience)\nSenior-level professional (10+ years of experience)\n\nHow long should a resume be for an entry-level position?\nIt goes without saying that you should definitely stick to a one-page resume. \nIf you're looking to fill an entry-level position, you're probably either:\nStill a student\nA recent graduate\nA job hopper\nOr a career changer\nIn any case, the lack of practical work experience is your Achilles heel. But there's a way around it...\nYou don't have an extensive work history or a high level of expertise. And that's okay – the tasks and responsibilities of an entry-level job position are generally more basic compared to higher-level positions. \nStill, there's a way you can make the most of the many skills, hard and soft, that are already in your arsenal. We advise you to consider opting for a different resume format altogether. \nDifferent resume formats can draw the recruiters' attention to different resume sections. Simply by visually emphasizing, or de-emphasizing, their importance. \nWhy use a chronological resume (the one that is mostly concerned with your work experience), when you can highlight your transferable soft skills and hard skills by choosing to write a skills-based resume instead. \nHow long should a resume be for a mid-level position?\nHere's where the waters start to be a bit muddier. Nevertheless, our recommendation is: try to stick to a one-page resume. However, if you feel that you simply can't fit all your relevant contributions and achievements into one page, don't be afraid to stretch your resume to two (full) pages. \nFriendly warning though, if you do use a two-page resume, make sure your second page is filled in its entirety!\nThis doesn't mean that you should try to artificially inflate the size of your resume. There's hardly anything more unprofessional than padding your resume with fluff. \nIt can make you look unfocused, haphazard, and unconscientious. Believe us, the recruiters can always tell.\nNeed help fitting a resume to one page?\nOur resume builder allows you to customize resume templates to make sure everything fits.\nCreate a resume\nHow long should a resume be for a senior-level position?\nIf you're a senior-level professional, your involvement in the workforce might span 10+ years. Given the depth of experience and range of skills typical for senior roles, a two-page resume is not only possible but sometimes necessary. \nJust remember, a resume should never exceed two pages!\nShould you submit a three-page resume, you're risking losing the reader's attention. And in the world of job hunting, that is an act of self-sabotage. Don't forget the 6 seconds rule! It applies to resumes of all lengths. \nThis two-page resume should highlight all your strong suits, like:\nA deep knowledge of your area of specialization;\nStrong leadership abilities;\nThe ability to manage complex projects; \nStrategic decision-making;\nConception and implementation of long-term strategies;\nDevelopment and guidance of others. \nResume vs CV: What is the (length) difference?\nYou might've done a double-take just now. \nYes, there is a difference between the two. \nIn Europe, Asia, or the Middle East the two terms can be used interchangeably. However, in Northern America (the U.S.A. and Canada) there's a clear distinction between the two documents, mainly in their: purpose, content, and length. \n1. Purpose\nResume: Resume is used as a part of job application across most industries. It presents information that is the most relevant for the position you're applying for. Each resume is custom-tailored to specific job postings. \nCV: CVs are used in academia, scientific, and research fields. Unlike a resume, a CV isn't usually customized for each job application. \n2. Content\nResume: The core of a resume consists of your professional summary, work experience, skills, and education. Other sections may include: volunteering, certificates, or awards. \nCV: It extensively details your academic history, such as: description of your degrees; your teaching experience; involvement in research projects; lecturing at conferences; list of your publications; or professional references. \n3. Length\nResume: Resumes are brief and targeted. Their length is between 1-2 pages. We strongly advise against anything longer. \nCV: As CVs cover your entire academic career, there really is no limit to its length. CVs can span several pages – sometimes even 15 and more. \nHow far back should a resume go?\nYou may ask yourself: “How long should a resume be for 20 years experience?”.  As your experience in the workforce grows, so does your potential resume content. The more time you spend working, the more deliberate you'll have to be about which information to keep and which to let go off.\nThere is an unwritten rule for how far back should a resume go – the work experience on your resume should not be older than 10 or 15 years. This is more than enough to showcase your career growth and relevant skills without overloading your resume with outdated information. \nThe work landscape changes fast, and the skills you've picked up 11 years ago may not be so relevant to the corresponding job position now. \nWhen can you leave out a job entry?\nThere's a way how to describe the work experience on your resume properly. It entails quite a lot of information:\nThe name of your employer\nThe name of your job position\nDates of employment\nWhat you learnt\nWhat value did you bring to your employer\nHow did your skills impact your team\nDo what you can, you'll only manage to fit around 3-4 job entries a page. \nIf you need help weeding out unnecessary job entries, consider the following questions:\nIs this job entry older than 10-15 years? Older job entries don't necessarily reflect the level of your current skills and capabilities. Recruiters are interested in your most recent jobs anyways.\nIs this job entry relevant to the position I wish to fill? Relevancy is key! Focus on jobs and roles that highlight your qualifications for the position you're applying for. Omitting irrelevant job entries keeps your resume concise and focused. For example, if you're applying for a mid-level position in marketing, you don't have to mention the part-time babysitting gig you did while in college. \nDoes this job entry involve the same achievements and duties as my other entries? Keep in mind that a resume is just a summary of your career. In your work experience, you've probably held similar positions in different companies. If this is your case, choose to highlight only the most significant or recent ones.\nIn short, anything that doesn't add value to your resume must go. \nRemember, the goal of your resume is to present the most compelling and relevant experiences and skills. It's a strategic selection that should convince the recruiters that you are the right person for the job.\nKeep your resume focused, relevant, and concise to make the strongest impact.\n\nHow to make your resume fit one page?\nIf you're still scratching your head over how to fit your resume to just one page, here are five tips you may find useful.\nCustom tailor your content.\nAnything that doesn't add value to your resume must go.\nPay attention to word economy.\nAvoid flowery descriptions; use bullet points instead of full sentences; use action verbs.\nKeep your professional summary short.\nIt takes only 3-5 sentences to pen an effective and eye-catching summary.\nAvoid repetition.\nWatch out for work experience entries with the same job descriptions.\nDon't be afraid to reduce sections.\nMake your resume more compact by reducing or removing unnecessary sections.\nNow, let's look more closely at each of these 5 tips and explain in depth what you should do to fit a resume into one page.\n1. Tailor your content.\nYou should custom tailor your resume to fit a specific job description each time you're sending a new application. This will help you eliminate any unnecessary information that might take up precious space. \nMake the content of your resume align as closely as possible with specific job requirements. Emphasize the skills and experiences that showcase your suitability for the particular position:\nGo back to the job posting. \nIdentify keywords and phrases related to the job description and candidate requirements.\nSelect your job entries based on which best connect to the said keywords.\nIn your work experience descriptions, go into detail about specific achievements and successes that make you the perfect candidate for the job. \nEvery piece of information should add value, focusing on outcomes and impacts rather than just duties.\nIf possible, use quantifiable metrics for stronger impact. \n2. Word economy.\nSometimes, you can shrink the text volume in your resume just by rephrasing it better. \nThe aim here is to convey the maximum amount of information with the fewest words. \nAvoid flowery descriptions. Keep your sentences straight-to-the point, free of any unnecessary digresses. \nUse bullet points. Writing in full sentences can also be a waste of space. Instead, use bullet points to get the message across. It will make your resume more digestible, organized, and easier on the recruiter's eye. \nUse action verbs. Instead of “I did this” and “I did that” start your bullet points with action verbs like 'managed', 'developed', 'led', etc. This makes your accomplishments sound more impactful and cuts down on word count.\nLook at this example of a candidate's work description:\n“As a Marketing Advisor at XYZ Corp, I was deeply immersed in the intricate world of strategic marketing, where I embraced the challenge of crafting compelling narratives to enhance brand visibility and foster meaningful customer engagement. In this role, I also played a pivotal part in analysing market trends and consumer behaviour. I took great pride in collaborating with cross-functional teams, where I offered my expertise and creative vision to elevate every project. My tenure was marked by a passionate commitment to excellence and innovation, consistently seeking new avenues to enrich the customer experience and strengthen the company’s brand presence in a competitive landscape“.\nPretty exhausting isn't it? Descriptions similar to this are the surest way to annoy and bore the hell out of any recruiter. Your resume will go directly to trash. \nThe same job description can be easily fixed and rewritten. Following our tips you can go from boring and lengthy description, to something like this:\nMarketing advisor | XYZ Corp\nLed 5 major marketing campaigns, increasing brand visibility by 30%\nAnalysed market trends across 10+ industries, driving strategies that resulted in a 20% increase in market share\nCollaborated with 4 cross-functional teams, enhancing project outcomes by 40%\nImplemented innovative marketing techniques that boosted overall profitability by 15%\nDeveloped and executed 3 key customer experience enrichment strategies\n3. Keep your professional summary short. \nYour resume summary can be another word trap. Many people make the mistake of trying to include too much information into their summaries. \nRemember, this is supposed to be a short text. It's meant to be just a teaser of what the recruiter can find in your resume, not the whole resume itself. It takes only 3-5 sentences to pen an effective and eye-catching summary. \nTake this as an example of an effective resume summary:\n“Experienced Marketing Advisor with 6 years of proven success in enhancing brand growth and market share. Skilled in utilizing analytics to drive strategic campaigns and improve customer engagement. Recognized for creative problem-solving and effective team collaboration. Committed to innovative, impactful marketing solutions that resonate with diverse audiences and achieve business objectives.“\n4. Avoid repetition. \nThis one is pretty self-explanatory. It directly ties to what we've talked about in previous paragraphs. Once you've finished writing your resume, check it again for any unnecessary repetitions, such as:\nWork experience entries with the same/similar descriptions\nRepetitive use of the same adjectives  \nRepetitive daily tasks descriptions\nIf you feel that you need to include several similar roles, focus on how you've grown or what new responsibilities you took on in each position. This can show career progression.\n5. Don't be afraid to reduce sections. \nWhile each resume section serves its unique purpose, sometimes the best way to make your resume more compact is to reduce or leave some of them out:\nEducation details. If you've already spent several years working in a specific industry, it's not necessary to go into great detail in your “education” section. Avoid writing about your coursework, GPA, or academic awards. Listing just your degree, name of the institution, and the dates of study will suffice. \nHobbies and interests. Unless your hobbies or interests relate directly to the job you're applying for, you can remove this section altogether. \nKey takeaways: How long should a resume be?\nThe ideal resume length is typically one page. Two-page resumes are also acceptable in certain cases, but keep in mind that a resume should never be three pages or longer.\nResume length by career stage:\nEntry-level: Stick to a one-page resume, highlighting skills and education.\nMid-level: A one-page resume is recommended, but two pages can be acceptable if needed to adequately showcase your achievements.\nSenior-level: A two-page resume is acceptable given the depth of experience, but it shouldn't exceed this length.\nInclude up to 10-15 years of work experience on your resume. Older positions may not be as relevant and can be omitted to save space and maintain relevance.\nTailoring your resume for each specific job application is key. It will help you keep your resume to one page by removing any information that doesn't connect to the job requirements. Always highlight the experiences and skills which are the most relevant to the position you're applying for. \nIf you need to make your resume fit into one page, you can use strategies such as word economy, avoiding repetitions, and removing less critical sections. \nWhen trying to fit your resume into one page, don't just cram all the information together without any forethought. For your resume to be truly impactful, you need to pay attention to its readability and clarity. We have a solution! With our resume templates you'll find the right layout to elevate your resume."}}]}

(+Tips on How Many Jobs to Include)\n\nIt’s no wonder why simple questions like “How far back should a resume go?” or “Does a resume have to include all the jobs?” can be challenging to answer nowadays.\nOur world is vastly different than it was just two decades ago. People job-hop at nearly twice the rate, and staying at one job for 10+ years has become very uncommon.\nWe’ll go over how far back should your resume go in 2024, regardless of whether you're\na student\na fresh graduate\nan experienced professional\nPlus, we look at how many jobs to include, when to remove old jobs and answer your FAQs. \nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nHow far back should a resume go in 2024?\nStudent or recent graduate work experience (0 – 2 years of experience) \nEntry level work experience (2 – 5 years of experience) \nMid-level and experienced professionals (more than 5 years of experience)\nHow many jobs should I put on my resume?\nWhen to remove old jobs from a resume ?\nFAQ: How far back should a resume go?\nHow far back should a resume go in 2024?\nThe common advice is to keep the work experience in a resume between 10 to 15 years. Doing so will give your hiring manager a general outline of your career beginnings, your growth, and where you find yourself now. \nHowever, this rule isn't set in stone, and the answer can vary depending on a few factors, such as: \nHow long you’ve been in the workforce;\nDoes your experience align with your job target;\nAnd your qualifications. \nGenerally, if a job provided you with valuable experience and skills that align with your target job, then you want to add it to your resume. \nOn the other hand, if your past experience from years ago isn't relevant for the desired job, you should consider skipping it and giving more attention to other sections — like skills and resume objective. \nAmazing work experience?\nComplement it with a stunning resume.\nCreate resume\nStudent or recent graduate work experience (0 – 2 years of experience) \nAs a student or recent graduate, you're probably not concerned about how far back your resume should go. \nIn fact, you might be concerned about the opposite. Do you even have enough years of experience on your resume?\nAll we have to say to this is — don’t worry. It's expected for you to have minimal experience when entering the workforce. Besides, you’ll realize in a bit that you’re more qualified than you think. \nYou don’t need to have years of experience on your resume to show your employer you’re the right candidate for the job.\nYou can do so by highlighting your: \nTransferable skills (gained while you volunteered, interned, fundraised, or co-worked on a project);\nHard skills (like programming languages, data analysis, SEO, etc.)\nRelevant projects, dissertations, or research.\nHigh-school and college achievements;\nPart-time and summer jobs; \nAs you can see, as a recent graduate your best strategy is to focus on your skills. A resume that is skills-based, is also called a functional resume. It's also great for people changing careers and those with employment gaps, since it takes away attention from the lack of work experience.\nJust make sure that what you jot down in your resume is relevant to the job and that it reflects your character and work ethic. Most employers are quick to notice when a resume is full of fluff. \nAlso, just because you weren't paid as an intern and/or volunteer doesn't mean what you did wasn't work. You can still write them down as work experience, for example: \n\nEntry level work experience (2 – 5 years of experience) \nIf you're someone with entry-level work experience, it’s time to minimize the importance of your college experience. \nThat means removing your college courses, awards, school projects, and GPA from your resume.  \nInstead, your main focus should be on your post-graduation experience. Whether that be your first job(s), internships, or volunteering. \nBecause you're still fresh into the workforce, you might find that your resume’s job experience is lacking. \nIn such cases, apart from including a work experience section, you can complement it with other resume sections, such as: \nSkills. Regardless of the job and your experience level, skills are essential to any resume. Whether that be hard, soft, or transferable skills. Or all of these. Nowadays, skills are actually often more sought after by employers than work experience.\nProjects. Including personal projects on a resume that align with your job prospect is a great way to show a hiring manager your dedication and internal motivation to succeed in your career.\nAchievements and awards section. Here you can mention any relevant achievements for the job. It can include scholarships, competitions, work-related awards, or even promotions to higher positions in your job.\nMid-level and experienced professionals (more than 5 years of experience)\nIf you’ve been in the workforce for 5 to 10 years, you’re still not at the point where you should be worried about how far back you should go on a resume. \nHowever, it’s advised not to write down every single job you’ve had. Instead, list only the jobs that are related to the job in question.\nFor those who have worked for more than 10 years, it's now time to start implementing the 10 to 15 year rule. \nBy implementing the 10 to 15 year rule you’re making sure your resume is:\nRelevant. In a fast changing world, jobs that took place long ago may be irrelevant to today's job market.  \nClear. You want the hiring manager to have a clear outlook of where you started, how you progressed and how you got to where you are now. \nConcise. Limiting your job listings makes it easier to stick to an appropriate resume length (1-2 pages). \nTailored. Adding only the jobs that align with an employer’s job description is a great way to get noticed. Especially as on average hiring managers sift through 100’s of resumes per job. \nAlso, by not going further than 15 years in your work history, you lessen the probability of ageism in the workplace. \nIf however, you find yourself with older experience that is still relevant to the job at hand. You could always showcase the skills gained at that job in your professional summary.\n\nHow many jobs should I put on my resume?\nThis question depends on the type of career you have. If for example, you have a government job or work in academia, then you might have to provide an extensive and oftentimes complete work history. \nHowever, the general advice is to add between 3 to 7 job listings. \nAdding more than that will only serve to distract the recruiter.  \nAlso, as a rule of thumb, you only need to go into detail in your last two to three jobs. Then, decrease the level of detail the further back you go. Eventually, your older job listing should be only the dates of employment, your role, and the company’s name. \n\nChristy's word of advice\nHow long is a piece of string? How far back your resume should go depends on your industry, career level, and the experiences you’d like to highlight. A junior professional can usually leave it all in, whereas for a mid- or senior-level person, 6-8 years of increasingly shorter job descriptions is generally fine, followed by just the companies/titles/dates for earlier jobs (or removing them entirely if not relevant/quite junior). Anything relevant beyond that could even be simplified with a one-line statement (e.g. Previous experience: Junior Program Manager, Assistant Program Coordinator)\nChristy Morgan, Resident HR Expert\nWhen to remove old jobs from a resume ?\nIdeally, you want to tailor your resume so that the jobs you list in your work experience are:\nno older than 15 years;\nrelevant to the job you’re applying for. \nThat means if you have a mid-level to experienced role, there's rarely a need to add a summer job you had in high school. Remove it.\nAll in all, there will rarely be a need for you to jot down your entire job history on a resume. It's a marketing document, not a legal one. \nIf you’re still having a hard time deciding which jobs to remove or add to your resume, remember that the same advice you’ve applied when learning how to write a resume applies here — keep your work experience relevant, clear, and concise.","URL Slug":"how-far-back-should-a-resume-go-in-2024?-(+tips-on"}}]}

We've already tested it here: LinkedIn Resume Builder: Does It Pass the Test? \nThe result?\nIn short, we don't find it sufficient for a resume creation. Here are the main reasons:\nThe LinkedIn resume template is unremarkable\nIt doesn't allow you to change the order of the sections\nYou can't change the font, line height, or any other formatting\nIt ignores some of the profile content — e.g. Publications, Volunteering, or Languages (which are common resume sections)\nTherefore, we recommend using a platform that enables you to pull data from your LinkedIn profile and freely edit it in a separate resume builder — and yes, this is a shameless self-promotion — like Kickresume.\nWe'll explain how to upload your data there and simply turn your LinkedIn profile into a resume.\n\nHow to rewrite LinkedIn profile into a resume\n1. Download your data from LinkedIn\nOpen your LinkedIn Data Archive Page: Click “Me” and go to “Settings & Privacy”.\nClick the \"Data Privacy\" tab in the left panel.\nSelect “Get a copy of your data”.\nSelect “Download larger data archive” and click “Request archive”. (LinkedIn says this might take up to 24 hours.)\n\nYou'll receive an email when the first installment of your archive is ready for download — this one contains your profile info.\nMine was ready pretty quick — in 15 minutes.\nNow download the .zip file that you've requested.\nGot a killer LinkedIn profile?\nMake sure your resume is just as great.\nImport LinkedIn profile\n2. Import your LinkedIn data\nLogin/Signup to Kickresume.com\nSelect “Create New” and “Import from LinkedIn”.\n\nHere you can import your .zip file which will be automatically converted into a resume:\n\n3. Pick a resume template that you like\nNow you can choose from 37 eye-catching resume templates.\nPick a template that fits your content and industry and your LinkedIn data will be automatically converted into it.\nDon't worry if you're unsure whether the selected template will fit your content the best — you can change it anytime later.\n\n4. Adjust the length\nLinkedIn profile allows you to have a whole career history. And usually, recruiters expect to find more information there than on your resume.\nThe reason is simple — on your resume, you’re limited by a number of pages and you should focus on most relevant things. \nThe recommended resume length is 2 pages maximum (but it’s okay if it’s longer as long as there’s a specific reason behind it, e.g. you’re a project manager with more years of experience).\nIn general, try to keep it short and sweet — don’t fill your resume with fluff and nice-to-have things that aren't so important and can be easily found on your LinkedIn profile.\nFor instance, my LinkedIn import was converted into a 1,5 pages long resume, I've shortened it to 1 page.\nIf you have more content that would hardly fit on 1 or 2 pages, you can first try a two-column layout as more content fits there.\nYou can also play with the formatting like changing the font size or adjusting the line spacing.\nIn the left bar, click on \"Design\" and there you can play with the template design and customization.\n\nThanks to live preview, you can immediately see every change displayed on your resume, without having to leave the editing mode.\nBelow you can see a comparison of how the overall looks of a resume changed only by switching the font size from M to S and changing the line spacing from 16px to 15px:\n\nThanks to this small change, the whole skills section fits on the first page and the work experience section is better visually divided.\n5. Remove, add, or reorder sections\nNow let's move onto the real editing — changing the content itself.\nThe good news is that with this import, your resume also contains sections a LinkedIn resume doesn't (even though they're filled in your LinkedIn profile), such as Publications, Languages, or Awards.\nIf you find some sections not so relevant to the job you're targeting, feel free to remove them. Just click on the name of the section, then on the bin icon in the top right corner and confirm the deletion.\n\nFor instance, I've deleted Languages and Awards which were not so relevant and mentioned them briefly in other relevant sections like Education and Skills.\nOn the other hand, you can add relevant resume sections that can't be found on LinkedIn, such as:\nKey achievements\nSocial Media\nHobbies\nReferences (this section isn't a part of LinkedIn dataset)\nCustom resume sections (for example, if you’re a software developer, you can create a “Side projects” section in which you detail your own work)\nAs a content writer, I've added a custom section \"Published articles for\" and listed there blogs and websites.\nYou can add any resume section by clicking on the button “+Add new section” in the top right corner.\n\nFinally, reorder the sections according to what's most important. Click on the name of the resume section, click “Reorder” on the left side and here you can simply reorder sections by dragging them to your desired spot.\n\nIf you're not sure how to order your resume sections based on where you're in your career, here's a little cheatsheet:\nA student/fresh graduate with less work experience: Start with contact information, resume summary and then follow with education, work experience, skills and other optional sections (such as volunteering).\nAn experienced professional: Start with contact information, resume summary and then follow with key professional skills, work experience, education and other optional sections (such as certifications or technical skills).\nA career changer: Start with contact information, resume summary and then follow with relevant skills, relevant work experience, education and other optional sections.\n\nTip\nIf you like the layout of a certain resume section, you can use it and simply rename it as you want to. For instance, I’ve used the strengths section and renamed it into “Published articles for”.\n6. Add missing contact information\nThere's some contact information that should be included in your resume and is probably not on your LinkedIn profile (it's sensitive data and we don't recommend sharing them online).\nSuch as:\nphone number\npersonal email\naddress\ndate of birth\nYour resume should definitely contain key contact information like phone number and email, so recruiters can reach you.\nIt's also a plus if you include your address, especially if it matches the location of the new job that you're targeting. Most companies want to hire locally and they make ATS systems parse out your address.\nAs for the date of birth, this depends on the country where you're applying for a job. While in some European countries it's common to include a date of birth on your resume, in the US it's improper to include it due to age discrimination.\n7. Consider whether to include your picture or not\nYes, on LinkedIn it's common to include a profile picture. Actually, it's a bit weird if you don't have any. After all, it's a social media profile.\nWhen it comes to resumes, in some countries, it's common to include a picture too — for instance in Slovakia, Austria, Germany, or Switzerland.\nStill, it's not a must and there are even some countries where it's not advised at all — such as the US, Canada, Belgium, or Netherlands.\nYou can easily upload or hide the picture in the personal information section:\n\nIf you're not sure whether you can use a resume picture in your country or not, check out this article: Should You Put Your Picture on Your Resume in 2022 (+Examples)\n8. Edit your resume summary\nMajority of LinkedIn summaries are far too long for a resume, or too conversational. Or maybe you don't have any summary at all.\nWell, your resume should. It's the first thing recruiters are going to see and it should give them an immediate overview of who you are as a professional.\nKeep your resume summary 2-5 sentences (or bullet points) long, 3 being the sweet spot. \nAdd your job title, say how many years of experience you have in your field, and highlight any specific skills or accomplishments.\nHere's an example of how I rewrote it:\nLinkedIn summary\nJournalist by trade, writer by fate. Currently exploring the world of content creation with Kickresume to help people get closer to the job of their dreams. \nResume summary\nContent Editor & Writer with 3+ years of experience in writing and editing. Currently exploring the world of content creation with Kickresume where I manage the company blog. My insights and career guides have been published by The Female Lead, College Recruiter, AppleMagazine and ISIC, among others.\nSee the difference?\n9. Reduce the skills section\nUnlike a LinkedIn profile, a resume doesn’t need the 30 skills you added for SEO purposes. \nAlso, the skills section on your LinkedIn profile is tailored to your position or industry as such.\nHowever, a skills section on your resume should be tailored to a specific job you're targeting.\nHave a look at the job ad and jot down only the most relevant skills — 7-10 skills should be more than enough. \nIf you have more of them, you can also divide them into subsections like Tools & Software, Data Mining, Soft Skills, and so on.\n10. Change your keyword optimization\nWhile a LinkedIn profile uses keywords that speak the language of a career field, a resume should speak with the language of the prospect job or company.\nJust like you did in the skills section, you should also incorporate relevant skills and keywords throughout your resume summary and work experience.\n\nTip\nYou can create a master version of your LinkedIn resume and then create multiple copies that you can tailor to each specific job opening.\n11. Reduce the work experience descriptions\nLinkedIn allows you to list all your accomplishments and job duties.\nOn your resume, you should only focus on main achievements and then list around 3-5 main job duties.\nFor instance, on my LinkedIn profile I have 16 bullet points under the current job title, I've reduced it to 12 bullet points — 7 achievements and 5 job duties.\nI recommend putting main achievements first because that will grab the attention of the hiring managers. Then, you can list a few most important duties because that’s adding the context.\nYou can maybe get away just with the achievements if you’re in an achievement-focused role, for instance sales.\nBut in general, I’d recommend having a mix — context plus impact.\nAnd, of course, the older (or less relevant) the job position is, the less details you can include.\n12. Change the tone\nEven though LinkedIn is a professional networking site, it's less formal than resumes. You can write in the first person, show more personality, or be creative with your headlines.\nBut your resume is a formal document and your tone should reflect that. \nEliminate colloquial phrasings and avoid using first person pronouns — heck, you can even opt to remove all personal pronouns.  \nThe only resume section I recommend writing in 1st person is a professional summary, because it’s kind of personal and you’re introducing who you are.\nMaybe you can get away with 1st person also in the hobbies section, for example “I’m a fabulous brownie baker! I raised $1,500 in a charity baking competition in 2019.”\nBut try to write the rest of your resume in 3rd person because that’s more objective. Plus, you’re trying to be concise and we know it’s about you anyway.\n13. Do final touch-ups\nWhen you're happy with the content, you can play with the formatting and do final touch-ups.\nFor instance, divide sections into bullet points — it helps to guide the reader’s eye through your resume.\nYou can also highlight important information using bold or cursive font. For example, I highlighted Key accomplishments in the work experience description.\nI also adjusted bullet points which took more space and could be easily reduced to 1-2 lines.\nIf something sticks out, either try to rewrite it or incorporate it in another relevant section/bullet point.\n14. Add a link to your LinkedIn profile\nFinally, add your LinkedIn profile link. In today's hiring, it's a must — given the fact that 87% of recruiters use LinkedIn as part of their hiring process. \nFirst, recruiters are probably going to check you out anyway. By including your LinkedIn URL you make sure they find the right profile and can find you straight-away.\nSecond, on your LinkedIn, you can show them your whole career history that didn't fit on your resume. You can even show samples of your work as you can add attachments, hyperlinks, videos, or presentations.\nThird, our in-house HR expert recommended it too.\nHow to put LinkedIn on a resume?\nYou can either include it in your contact information section, or add a separate section called “Social media”.\nHowever, we only recommend doing so if you have more social media profiles that could be included in your resume (e.g. you're a social media manager and want to show off your work).\nHere's how it looks like if you add a LinkedIn profile URL in your personal information section:\n\nAnd here's a sample resume with LinkedIn URL in a separate social media section:\n\nIf you're not sure how to get your LinkedIn URL, just go to your profile and copy the displayed URL. And in case you wish to edit it, tap the edit icon next to the contact section.\n15. Download your resume in PDF\nNow your resume is ready and you can download it and apply!\nIn the left bar, click on “Download” and then “Download in PDF”.\nAlternatively, you can send your resume to email or save to Dropbox or Google Drive."}}]}

It's a fast-paced, demanding and ever-evolving industry that requires you to have the ability to embrace change, accept risks and never cease to work on your skills.\nOn the other hand, the banking industry is a reliable source of well-paid jobs, which makes it a hot-spot for aspiring young professionals interested in hatching a top career. It's also pretty generous when it comes to opportunities for solid long term career growth.\nLast but not least, the career in banking will ready you with a wide range of transferable skills from dealing with people to crunching numbers and solving problems with ease.\nThat means you can also think of it as your gateway to other types of jobs that you may want to land in the future.\nReady?

Bank teller, loan officer, financial analyst, internal auditor or branch manager? \nBe sure to take your personality traits into account, too. Do you want to interact with customers and their money? Or would you prefer having a more analytical back-office role that allows you to dive deep into numbers and raw data? \nThe banking sector offers something for everyone. Salaries and formal job requirements differ, though.\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, bank tellers earn less than $30k per year on average but the job doesn't require a university level of education.\nOn the other hand, the job of a loan officer and financial analyst requires a bachelor's degree and offers a median annual pay of $63k and $85k, respectively.  A financial analyst, in particular, may also benefit greatly from conquering the CFA Level 1 exam.\nThe highly competitive world of banking also enables you to earn promotions and work your way up through various positions. Remember — it's all up for grabs.\nSo even if you start out as a bank teller, there's no reason to despair. Just gain enough experience and knowledge and the role of a loan officer or even a financial manager can be yours.\nInvest in your future.\nScore a well-paid job with an outstanding resume.\nCreate resume\nResume format: Determine your competitive advantage\nThere are no restrictions when it comes to resume composition. But with a suitable resume format, you can make the reader's attention rivet on the aspects of your career that deserve to be in the spotlight and make less attractive parts a bit more inconspicuous.\nIf you’ve got years of work experience to showcase, choose a chronological resume format. It's a true classic that records your career progression and makes each of your steps count.\nBut if you want to highlight a diverse range of technical, transferable and soft skills that you possess, choose a functional resume format.\nThis one comes in handy especially when you need to downplay a gap in your employment history or a lack of relevant work experience.\nThere's naturally a third option, too: to come up with a hybrid resume that gives priority to literally anything that you deem important.\nThis can include your education history, references or awards you've earned — just about anything that you think will convince them to hire you.\n\nResume sections: Leave nothing to chance\nWhen it comes to resume writing, perfection lies in the details. \nMess the formatting up and you'll end up with low readability. Use cheesy words or worn-out phrases and nobody will listen. Include less relevant keywords and your resume might not beat the bots.\nLet's now explore the potential of individual resume sections and address their specifics head-on:\n1. Profile summary \nMany people start their resumes with individual sections such as Work Experience or Skills. But when it comes to marketing yourself to the recruiter, nothing compares to a well-written resume summary sitting on the top of your resume.\nJust to make it clear: profile summary is your resume — only extremely condensed. It's a tiny resume for those who don't yet know if they want to read the rest of it and get more details.\nThat's why you need to make it sound fresh and juicy. Remember that the reader's attention is a very elusive thing that needs to be pampered. Use your summary to say three basic things: who you are, what you do and what makes you stand out. \nHere's an example of an excellent profile summary that's hard to beat:\nOver 7 years of Business Analyst and IT Consultant experience with extensive international experience. Possess a Master’s Degree in Information Systems from the University of Economics in Prague. Other qualifications include:\nWorking knowledge of banking and insurance products, marketing and business processes\nExcellent communication (verbal and written) and interpersonal skills; able to communicate effectively to management, users, developers, and cross-functional team members.\nWell-developed analytical and problem-solving skills.\nExpertise in gathering, analyzing and documenting user stories, business and functional requirements and process flow.\nHighly motivated self-starter, capable of a team and individual work.\n2. Work experience \nYou surely have a lot to say about your former jobs. And that's when formatting comes in handy — to help the reader navigate the text with ease.\nMake sure your work experience has a neat structure and follows a reverse chronological format. Include dates (months and years) to help recruiters see your career trajectory with the most recent — and the most relevant — items on the top.\nUse bullet points together with action verbs to list your job responsibilities. Quantify your achievements. Include numbers to specify anything from revenue growth and number of clients to annual savings.\n\n3. Education \nEspecially if you're fresh out of college or it wasn't so long ago when you graduated, you shouldn't just skim the surface but include specific details about your studies. \nMake your academic achievements speak of your dedication and hard work and you're halfway there. What was your GPA? Did you get any notable award? Did you do any coursework that's relevant to the job you're now applying for?\nThese details will help you compensate for the scarcity of hands-on experience and let recruiters know you're perfectly equipped for a demanding banking job. Learn more about how to exactly put GPA on your resume.\nBachelor of Science in Business Administration (01/2008 – 10/2012), The University of Milan, Milan, Italy \nGraduated with Honors \nCumulative GPA (4.00)\n4. Skills \nBanking jobs demand a pivotal combination of hard and soft skills. These should reflect specific keywords that are included in each job description.\nTailoring your resume to every position you're applying for is an essential part of your job search and failing to do so can result in very poor response — or none at all.\nHere's a list of the top soft skills in banking:\nTop soft skills in banking\nStrong analytical skills — identify trends, patterns and definitive conclusions from the reams of data you’ll have access to.\nComplex commercial awareness — anticipate financial trends and future business developments\nExcellent oral and written communication skills — convey and receive instructions, describe and explain complex financial concepts or procedures, write in-depth reports and communicate in a professional manner\nProblem-solving skills — tackle complex problems as they arise, which may involve addressing financial implications or coming up with personalised solutions\nCapacity for innovation — push the limits and come up with creative solutions\nAttention to detail — spot anomalies and simple mistakes that would have grave consequences\nDetermination and resilience — this includes having a relentless work ethic and willingness to make sacrifices in your personal life and work overtime to achieve goals and meet deadlines\nWorking under pressure – meeting deadlines and delivering results\nAnd here's a list of the top hard skills in banking:\nTop hard skills in banking\nMicrosoft Office — Excel (VBA, formulas, functions), Word, PowerPoint, Outlook\nPython\nSAP\nData query/data management tools — Access, SQL, Business Objects\nDatabase management systems (DBMS) — Oracle\nAccounts payable automation\nPredictive analytics\n5. Certifications\nIf you're a seasoned professional, include certifications that you've earned throughout your career:\nAccredited Tax Preparer (ATP) Certification 02/2008, Accounting Institute of Milan\nArchiMate 3.0 L1 Foundation 08/2019, OpenGroup\nIf you feel there are still gaps in your knowledge, though, turn your attention to online certificates. With the arrival of quality online education, obtaining a solid finance degree can be a matter of just a few months and a bit of free time.\nMake sure to choose one of the credible online education platforms acknowledged by hiring managers and industry professionals — Google’s Digital Garage, Coursera, Udacity, Khan Academy, Udemy, Shaw Academy or Hubspot:\nMachine Learning 12/2018, Stanford University on Coursera\nBanking Credit Analysis Process 04/2019, Udemy\nCompleting an online degree a great way to fill any gaps in your knowledge or compensate for any voluntary or involuntary employment gaps or parental leaves on your resume. It's also the easiest way to get high-quality education for just a fraction of the fees you’d pay for an ordinary college course.\n6. References\nBeing able to make it in the banking industry requires high levels of confidentiality and trust. That's why you need to provide trusted references to make the next step in your career.\nAsk your former employers, ex-colleagues and other trusted industry professionals if they're willing to put in a good word for you with your prospective employer.\nInclude their names and contact information in a designated section of your resume or, if you can't do so for any reason, make it clear that you’ll provide them upon request.\nMr. Bryan Simpson – Tax Supervisor, KPMG, Contact Number: 555-555-5555, Email: hello@kickresume.com\n7. Hobbies \nInclude hobbies on your resume only if you consider them instrumental in supporting your job-related skills and qualifications. Regular chess players, for example, usually come out strong on logical thinking and reasoning skills. Similarly, you're likely to believe triathlon or marathon runners will show great perseverance in the face of difficulty.\nOn the other hand, watching movies or having a sweet tooth are hobbies that will hardly help you improve your job prospects.\nIf you want your hobbies to act as effective icebreakers and good conversation starters, make sure to be really specific. After all, \"fervent golf player\" or \"contemporary American documentary novel lover\" sounds much more engaging than vague statements \"playing every kind of sport\" or \"getting lost in a good book.\"\n\n7 Excellent Banking Resume Examples To Get You Started\nWe all are visual beings.

We think there's one real resume example that's definitely worth your attention. Why?\n\nFirst, it’s Disney. The world of its own that gave rise to countless animated movies. The home of Donald Duck, Buzz Lightyear, Winnie the Pooh and many other popular characters.\n\nSecond, this brilliant resume proved to be Brendan McLoughlin’s ultimate winning ticket to get the Video Production Assistant role.\n\nResume Example: Video Production Assistant at Disney\nVideo Production Assistant Disney Sample\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\nAnd for these two reasons, we won’t just skim the surface. We’ll dig much deeper and read between the lines.\n\nA close reading of literally anything, let alone career documents, is a helpful tool to a deeper understanding of its structure and function. In other words, everything's there for a reason.\n\nSo let’s put Brendan's Disney resume under the microscope and bring its secrets to light.\n\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n\n1. Contact information\n2. About me\n3. Skills\n4. Work experience\n5. Education\n\n\n\n1. Contact information\ncontact information resume example\nFirst things first. Whichever resume template you choose to use, don’t forget to put your contact information in a clearly visible place.\n\nIf you want recruiters to get back to you, include your email address, phone number and address (though getting a letter seems unlikely, but you never know). And the link to your personal website or to your digital portfolio. If you have one, of course.\n\n2. About me\n\nThe introductory section is absolutely stellar. The first sentence answers two fundamental questions that every single hiring manager wants to know:\n\nWho are you? Writer-Producer-Editor\nWhat do you want? Media Operations Assistant role at BAMTech Media-Disney\nWith so many job seekers to handle every single day, recruiters simply love effective communication. And Brendan’s introductory hyphen-flooded sentence shows his cards right off the bat.\n\nYour resume can be even more impressive.\nChoose from 35+ design templates and get hired.\n\nCreate resume\nOn the other hand, the following paragraph introduces another effective resume technique: the art of storytelling. A simple and very readable narrative that's sure to capture anyone's attention.\n\nWhat you see here is an information-packed, ambition-driven and humor-fueled paragraph that has a lot to offer. It’s personal, brief, relevant. A concise and digestible history of Brendan’s life and career.\n\nIt exudes Brendan’s fascination with the visual media, describes his intrinsic motivation and appealing dedication to his vision. Well, who could resist hiring such a film buff?\n\n3. Skills\n\nHaving already sketched some of his personality in the introductory section, Brendan uses his Skills section to demonstrate his technical proficiency and hard skills. In this way, he effectively avoids using buzz words that would clutter his resume with fluffy nonsense — and discourage the HR manager from reading on.\n\nOf course, there are a few softer business-related skills, too (like Scheduling, Planning or Budgeting). But these are still highly relevant to the position. The presence of adjectives like “motivated”, “creative”, “passionate” or “skilled”, however, would tell recruiters nothing about the job seeker except the lack of real skills.\n\n4. Work experience\n\nThe well-structured resume puts focus on Brendan’s prolific career. In fact, his impressive work experience comprises more than half of his resume.\n\nNotice how every sentence starts in the Work experience section with an action verb. Each of them talks about the responsibilities Brendan had while on the job:\n\nManage. Navigate. Fill. Oversee. Serve. Write. Direct. Collaborate. Ensure. Install. Produce. Edit. Implement. Coordinate. Launch. Ingest. Maintain. Edit. Complete. Process…\n\nThese words sound very fresh. Yes, they do occasionally repeat. But the rich variety of action verbs provides a great picture of Brendan’s dexterity and versatility.\n\nSo next time you go about updating your resume, have a look at how you present your work experience to your potential employer. Try to infuse the descriptions with some interesting verbs — and adjectives, too — that will propel your resume to another galaxy\n\n5. Education\n\nWith three ongoing gigs going on at the same time and 5+ years of experience in the industry, Brendan’s got a handful of aces up his sleeve.\n\nAnd this is the reason why Education gets so little attention.\n\nHe knows that no one will be interested in what was his major or whether he graduated with straight A’s. All the recruiters are after is hard skills that you can demonstrate in your real work experience.\n\nAll in all, Brendan’s resume shows that it’s all about what’s relevant at the moment. Are you a fresh graduate? Talk about your college courses and internships. Are you a seasoned professional? Describe your career trajectory instead.\n\nGet hired with a winning resume\nYou don't have to walk the path millions of others have travelled before you.\n\nTo pave your way to your dream job — and perhaps take a little shortcut, too — turn your attention to real resume samples that got real people hired at real companies.\n\nThen apply the knowledge you gain from them to your own resume. Use engaging language to present your achievements and choose the resume format that's relevant to your current status. Get rid of marginal details and focus on the job you want to get.\n\nIt's simple as that: Learn from successful job seekers and follow in their footsteps.\n\nAstounded by the dream-come-true Disney job? It could be your turn next! To get there, let’s whip up a show-stopping resume.

Hard skills and soft skills.\nNow, you may be asking: What’s the difference? And how can I use that knowledge to my advantage?\nFirst, the demand for soft skills — also called transferable skills — is rapidly growing nowadays. After all, in most cases, hard skills can be learned. Soft skills, on the other hand, are a bit tricky. They come with your personality traits and can only be acquired, almost unknowingly, through experience.\nBut that doesn't mean hard skills are becoming less important. After all, they form the foundation of any job. \nIn other words, if you want to write a balanced resume, you should include at least some skills from both categories. \nWe're going to show you the main differences between soft and hard skills, provide a wide variety of examples and tips on how to create a solid skills section that will help you score a job.\n\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nHard skills are not that hard\nWhen soft skills take the lead\nHow to weave your soft and hard skills into a resume\nThe world is getting softer (?)\nHard skills are not that hard\nSurprisingly, hard skills are not that hard to obtain. They can be taught, learned, they're easy to quantify and measure.\nTypically, you can obtain them via formal education, i.e. college or university. Alternatively, you can also do so through books or training programs, or directly on the job. \nAmong others, hard skills include:\nCertifications. Those looking to work in education or healthcare may need extra certifications that will entitle them to perform the given job.\nComputer skills. The mastery of Word, Outlook, Excel, Powerpoint is taken for granted. Jobs in fields like accounting, fundraising or graphic design, however, require additional knowledge of specialized software programs. Also, you won’t usually get a job in IT without a reasonable knowledge of various computer coding languages like Java, Python and others.\nLanguages. Command of spoken and written languages like English, Spanish, German.\nCompleted training. Make sure to list any training that made you proficient in a specific area (e.g. driving license, forklift operation, first aid, touch typing, food safety).\nAs you can see, hard skills are also very easy to recognize. Employers have their minimum requirements when it comes to technical competencies. They’ll fish for the keywords in your resume until they find them — or get tired of it and throw your resume to trash, eventually.\nThis is especially valid for fields that rely on specific hard skills and require special training to perform the job. We’re talking here about careers in computing, academia, engineering, science and the like.\n\nExamples of hard skills in different industries\nFinance: Asset management, Account analysis, Forecasting, Budgeting\nComputing: Java, C++, Smalltalk, PHP, .NET, Java, HTML, pivot tables, ERP systems\nMarketing: Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Google Analytics, Content Management Systems (CMS), Wordpress, MailChimp\nProject management: Agile methodologies (i.e. Scrum), Project management software (i.e. Trello), Certifications (PMP, PRINCE)\nDesign: Adobe Creative Suite (i.e. Photoshop, InDesign), User Interface (UI), User Experience (UX) \nYour soft side mattress.\nCreate a balanced resume and score a new job.\nCreate resume\nWhen soft skills take the lead\nTo understand what soft skills really are, think of personality traits that can bring value to any job. Flexibility? Dependability? Strong leadership qualities?\nSimilarly to your personality traits, many soft skills come as a part of your upbringing. But that doesn't mean you can't learn and cultivate them as an adult. It only takes effort and time.\nAlso, most soft skills can bring value to all kinds of jobs. Their usefulness isn't limited to just one. No wonder these skills are also often called transferable — unlike hard skills. Those are strongly tied to a particular industry.\nMost people tend to believe hard skills are superior to soft skills. Because of that, they think, you should prioritize them in your resume. But that would be only partially correct. The importance of soft skills has been on the rise for at least a decade now.\nWhat’s more, LinkedIn’s 2019 Global Talent Trends report revealed that over 90% of recruiters think soft skills matter just as much — if not more — than technical skills in today’s job market.\nAll in all, it seems that a job seeker with a combination of the right soft skills and zero experience is more acceptable to HR managers than a job seeker with the relevant technical ability but weak soft skills. \nExamples of the top soft skills\nCommunication \nProblem-solving\nLeadership \nDecision-making\nReliability\nAdaptability and flexibility\nTime management\nTeamwork / Collaboration\nCreativity\nWillingness to learn\nRemember, you can’t just say that you have tons of soft skills without actually backing your words up with a real success story.\nSoft skills are somewhat subjective and therefore also difficult to express in numbers. It’s nearly impossible to quantify how well you work in teams or adapt to new conditions. Because of that, your experience section should always include a story about how you put them in use. \n\nIn the end, it's easier for an employer to teach you a hard skill than a soft skill. And although these skills don’t grow on trees, they will come naturally as you gain work experience and perform various tasks that depend on them.\nHow to weave your soft and hard skills into a resume\nFirst of all, you need to create a dedicated skills section on your resume that will contain both soft and hard skills.\nThen read the job description carefully to get a sense of which skills the employer is looking for. Obviously, there are some skills that you shouldn't include in your resume — especially those that are not connected to either your current or future field. It can harm your future job prospects and make you job search in vain.\nNow it’s time to introduce the bullet points. Use them to enhance the readability of your resume and convey the message to the recruiters in the most effective way. \nAnd perhaps most importantly, let your actions speak for you. Remember that descriptions like “skilled manager” or “effective communicator” mean nothing on their own. The best way to play up your skills is to fill your work experience section with specific examples of how you used them in the past.\nAnother great opportunity to promote your soft skills is  at your job interview. That includes being polite, showing up on time, being an active listener or a good partner in conversation.\nThe world is getting softer (?)\nIn the times when robots start stealing our work and AI is taking the world by storm, it’s vital that we understand the role of humans on the job market. \nThat’s why employers are on a lookout for well-rounded professionals that have the necessary technical abilities as well as interpersonal skills to interact with colleagues and solve problems as they arise.\nBut what does all of that have to do with your resume? Well, your career documents should reflect these trends. Start by updating your resume with a combination of your soft and hard skills to produce an accurate description of your professional experience. \nRecruiters will love it. \nSkills pay the bills.\nCreate a strong resume and score a new job.\nCreate resume\nNow that you're equipped to effectively present your hard and soft skills on a resume, why not use our tool to convert your LinkedIn profile into a sleek resume that highlights your comprehensive skill set?","URL Slug":"hard-vs-soft-skills:-how-to-use-them-effectively-o"}}]}

Then you'll need a proper federal resume.\n\nFederal resume format\nThe federal resume is quite different from a private industry one, and so is the process of writing it. \nThus, before you start writing your federal resume, it's essential to understand how it differs from a private sector resume.\nFederal vs private sector resume\nPrivate sector resumes tend to: \nrarely exceed two pages\ninclude a description of work experience or other qualifications that are shorter\nbe more “flashy”\nbe more selective, as they serve as a way of attracting attention rather than a detailed account of all the work experiences\nOn the other hand, federal sector resumes are usually: \nseveral pages long, usually 4 or 6\ninclude a long and detailed description of past experience\nfocus on meeting all of the requirements for a specific vacancy\nlist all of your experience and education\nSo, if you're planning on writing a federal resume, follow the advice below. \nNot too fond of writing?\nLet the AI write your resume for you!\nUse Kickresume AI writer\nHow to write a resume for a federal job? \nNow that you know that a federal resume differs from a private sector resume, let's take a look at how exactly you should compose it. \n1. Choose a suitable federal resume format \nThere are three main resume formats. They have different functions and serve different purposes. But when it comes to federal jobs, the safest option is to go with a chronological resume. \nThis resume lists information in reverse chronological order, placing the most recent work experiences first. This means that you should start with writing your personal info first, then continue with a resume summary, work experience, education, and skills, and then close the resume with optional sections such as volunteering or hobbies.\nThis is the most common and standard type of CV that should rarely harm your chances as it's clear, straightforward, and recruiters are familiar with it. \n2. Stick to minimalistic formatting and design\nLess is more when it comes to a federal resume. These are the things that you can do that will ensure that your federal resume will be accepted well: \nMinimize the use of color and graphics. A conservative color palette is the safest option for applying for a federal job. It's also best to avoid using any graphics since federal resumes are typically scanned by ATS systems.\nThe same applies when it comes to templates. For a federal job, a minimalistic resume template is ideal. \nChoose a simple and conventional font. It’ll be easy to read and appear professional. Arial or Roboto should do the job well. \nUse bullet points to structure your text. This will make your resume easy to read and filter through. It allows for the resume to visually “breathe”. \n\nPro tip: The government job search website USAJobs offers you an option to either upload a resume or use their resume template to create a new resume based on the information you provide in their resume builder.\n3. Include all the necessary resume sections\nYour resume should contain enough information that will let the recruiter know who you are, how to reach you, and what kind of work you’ve done. \nThus, every federal resume must include the following sections:\nPersonal information. You must include your full name, mailing address with zip code, area code, phone number, and email address.\nCitizenship. State whether you are a U.S. citizen or have a valid work visa.\nResume summary. Here, you suggest what you bring to the position, highlight the biggest career achievements, and explain how you can help the agency accomplish its mission. \nWork experience. In a federal resume, the work experience comes first (unless youre fresh out of school) and takes up around two pages. Here, you should write about all the related work experience from the last 10 years. \nEducation. Name what schools you've attended, what degrees you've obtained, the dates, and your GPAs. The federal resume offers you more space, so feel free to include more details regarding your education than you would in a conventional resume, such as names of related courses you've attended or awards that you've won. \nSkills. Highlight any specific skills or qualifications related to the job, such as language abilities, computer skills, or specialized training.\n\nIn a federal work experience section, feel free to:\nProvide a brief description of the organization you’ve worked for in the past if it’s not widely known. This will help the reviewer understand the context and scope of your experience.\nHighlight any relevant experience working with or for the federal government, including internships, volunteer work, or military service.\nlimit bullet points to 5-7 per position to ensure your resume remains easy to read and digest. In other words, keep the length of your work section reasonable. While federal resumes can be longer than private-sector resumes, aim for no more than.\nInclude the number of hours you worked per week in each of the positions. It’ll be used to quantify the length of your experience.\nIf applicable, in your federal resume, include also: \nVolunteering. Giving back to the community is one of the core values of U.S. society. Prove to your potential future employer — the government — that you’re an active member of your community. Volunteering is especially advised in your career when you don't have a lot of paid experience on your resume to lean on.\nOther qualifications. Courses, certificates, licenses, honors, awards, special accomplishments, memberships in professional societies and organizations, publications, leadership activities, public speaking, etc. — these are all important experiences that will elevate your federal resume and make you stand out. \n4. Add federal resume-specific sections\nWhile the sections described above are a conventional part of almost every resume, the federal resume, with its generous length, offers more space to include information that may help you to stand out from the competition. \nSo, if any of the sections below are relevant to you, include them in your federal resume: \nYour highest General Schedule (GS) grade. If you’re already presently employed within the federal government, mention your highest achieved GS grade and your current salary range. All positions within the U.S. federal government are classified under the General Schedule to determine pay rate and job responsibility.\nVeterans' preference. If you're a veteran, you get extra points for being better qualified for a government job. So if this applies to you, make sure that you indicate your veterans' preference status. For some federal jobs, even family members of veterans have an advantage, so just read the advertisement properly to know if this may apply to you. \nExisting security clearance. If you possess a security clearance from your current or previous employment within a government entity, provide it.\nPreferred location. The federal job announcement may include multiple potential locations for the position. Indicate your top-choice location so it's clear right off the bat. \n5. Quantify your accomplishments\nWhen describing your work experiences, focus on your accomplishments rather than simply listing your duties. Whenever possible, quantify these accomplishments by providing specific numbers or percentages. \nFor example, instead of saying, \"managed a team of employees,\" say \"supervised a team of 10 employees and increased productivity by 20%.\"\nIt’ll make you look super accomplished. \n6. Tailor your resume for each position by using keywords\nOnce you have your resume ready for submission, it's extremely tempting to submit that same resume to apply for all other job vacancies. But that doing so would be a major mistake.\nEven some jobs within the same series often require different skill sets or experience. No job vacancy is the same, and the same goes for resumes. And nothing can be more off-putting for a recruiter than a generic resume that was clearly meant for a different vacancy. \nTo ensure that your application fits the job opening, carefully read through the job announcement and identify keywords and phrases that describe the qualifications and skills the employer is looking for. \nThen, incorporate these keywords into your resume naturally to demonstrate that you’re a strong fit for the position.\n7. Proofread and edit your resume\nMake sure your federal resume is polished and free of errors. \nThoroughly proofread your resume for spelling and grammar mistakes. Ask a friend to review it as well. An error-free resume will show the employer that you're detail-oriented and serious about your application.\nPro tip: Since federal resumes tend to be very long, number the pages of your resume. This will make the recruiter's job much easier. \n8. Avoid including this on your federal resume\nLastly, in your application and on your federal resume, make sure to exclude the following: \na photograph\nresume video\nany sensitive information (such as age, date of birth, marital status, protected health information, religious affiliation, social security number, etc.)\nlinks to web pages or online portfolios\nThe federal resume is a serious document that follows a strict structure. Don't try to stand out by adding sections that aren't the conventional part of the federal job application. Avoid also any information that could lead to discrimination. \nFederal resume examples\nWant a resume as pretty as this one?\nSelect one of the Kickresume templates and wow the recruiter.\nCreate resume\n1.

As you can see, “Peter”, a soon-to-be graduate, did everything right.\nHe kept the resume design minimalistic, used a chronological resume template, and placed his junior work experience first and education second.

Usually, it goes like this:\nVisit the official job portal USAJobs. \nThe website www.usajobs.gov is the official job portal for federal government positions in the US. It has thousands of government jobs since a federal agency is required to post vacancies online if the position lasts at least 120 days. \nCreate an account. \nThen you'll be able to directly apply for jobs or receive automatic notifications of your saved job searches. This will help you to stay informed and prevent you from missing a good opportunity. \nSearch for the right opportunity.\nYou can search for your desired position by keyword, location, job category, or agency. If you're interested in a specific agency, such as the FBI, make sure to check its website for job vacancies too.\nRead the job announcement carefully.\nEach job announcement includes important information about the position, such as the duties and responsibilities, the qualifications required, and the application process. \nPrepare your application package.\nYour application package should include your federal resume, responses to any job-related questionnaires, and documentation supporting your eligibility or qualifications, such as transcripts, certifications, or veterans' preference documents.\nApply.\nOnce your application package is ready, follow the instructions in the \"How to Apply\" section of the job announcement.\nTrack your applications.\nAfter submitting your application, you can track its status on the USAJobs website. You'll be notified if you're selected for an interview or if the position has been filled. \n\nPro tip: For some positions, you may be asked to complete an additional application component — a self-assessment questionnaire. This psychological questionnaire lets you rate yourself on the abilities that you’ve listed in your federal resume. Don’t try to be humble, the ratings of your skills that you provide should match your resume and demonstrate confidence.\nHowever, keep in mind that the hiring process for federal jobs can take several weeks or even months, so be patient.\n\nWhat does the federal evaluation process look like? \nNow that you've completed your resume and submitted your federal resume, you're probably wondering what will happen next: \nAfter the submission, an HR specialist will review your application for completion. According to the rating system for applications, the candidates can be classified as Minimally Qualified, Qualified, or Best Qualified. If you fail to fall into any of these three categories, your application doesn't even get processed.\nIf you meet the basic qualification requirements, your application is forwarded to the hiring manager for consideration.\nThe hiring manager will identify the most suitable applicants and invite them for an interview. \nAfter the interview, send a thank-you note to the interviewer expressing your gratitude for the opportunity and reiterating your interest in the position. Be patient as you wait for a decision, and continue to monitor the status of your application on the USAJobs website.\nDepending on the outcome of the interview, a job offer may or may not be made. But if you accept an offer for a federal job, you'll be required to undergo a background check. You may need to provide the hiring agency with certain personal information for them to start the background investigation. After you provide your information, the agency will run a check into your past work experiences, criminal records, education, and financial history.\nAnd there you have it!

Here’s How to Handle It Like a Pro\n\nDo you remember when ASOS printed 17,000 plastic bags with a typo, or when Trump sent out invitations with a spelling error? We all mess up time from time and it can happen to anyone. But there is one place where you definitely shouldn't make a mistake — and that's on your resume. \nSo what should you do when that happens and you submit a resume that has a typo or another mistake? Is there a reason to freak out and respond with a foot-long apology letter? Or should you just do nothing and hope nobody will notice?\nWell, there’s no clear-cut solution. Each case deserves consideration on its own and asks for a different approach. \nWe’ve come to the conclusion that there are several possible scenarios when it comes to a faulty resume. Read on to figure out which one best fits your situation!\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nSmall mistakes aren't a reason to worry\nDetected some major errors? Resend your resume with style\nCover up your weaknesses\nWhat to do once you've made a mistake \nSmall mistakes aren't a reason to worry\nFirst, it’s important to realize that — unlike humans — not all mistakes were created equal. \nWhereas some of them can get your resume thrown in the trash, other ones will easily go unnoticed.\nSo if you’ve already made a mistake, you need to assess them to decide about the action you'll take. Not all typos are as bad as an egregious misspelling of the hiring manager’s name.\nAmong minor resume mistakes you can count: \na misplaced comma\na missing period \na minor typo \nYou definitely don’t want to call attention to a mistake that hardly stands out from your resume. If it’s not something that may spread confusion or misinformation that would be critical to the understanding of your resume, there’s no reason to point it out.\nRecruiters also usually have too many resumes to review and fussing about a missing punctuation mark won’t be their primary concern. If perfect spelling isn’t one of the requirements for the job, no little typo should be able to overshadow your experience and qualifications.\nFinally, learn from your own mistakes, and don’t forget to save the corrected version of your resume for future use. You never know when you’ll need it again and doing this upfront will pay off.\n\nDetected some major errors? Resend your resume with style\nThere are certain situations when you need to take action and follow up with a new, fixed version of your resume. \nSome of the larger mistakes that you can make are: \nincorrect/missing contact information\ninconsistencies (e.g. start and end dates, job titles, job duties)\nBut sending out a corrected version and saying “Sorry, there was a mistake in my resume” is probably the worst thing you can do.\nIt’s not very wise to draw attention to the mistakes you made. Rather than pointing out the mistakes and grammatical errors, simply present it as an “updated copy” or as your most recent document to replace any prior versions.\nThis is a smart and elegant way to avoid losing your reputation right from the outset. \nMost recruiters will also focus on the content rather than the formatting, so it’s very unlikely that they will fish for mistakes in the first version of your resume.\nJust realized you made a mistake?\nNo problem, adjust your resume on the go!\nGet Kickresume mobile app\nATS is your friend when you make a mistake in your resume\nIt’s good to know that most companies use automated technology to store resumes.\nThis means that when they receive a new file, the older version is simply deleted. So chances are your errors will fade into oblivion quite easily.\nHere’s an example of how to resend your resume and save face after a major snafu:\nDear [recruiter’s name]:\nHere is an updated copy of the resume I sent you last [day of the week], expressing my interest in [job title]. Please, refer to this version when you review my qualifications for the job.\nThank you,\n[your name]\nCover up your weaknesses\nTo draw the attention away from your errors even further, you can also enhance the updated version with a few added bullet points or a new resume section. However, these should relate to the position. \nAnd if you're eventually invited to an interview, be sure to bring a properly formatted resume with you.\nOn the other hand, if you feel the need to be honest, you might also get away with something short and light like:\nDear [recruiter’s name]:\nMy perfectionist nature would not allow me to overlook the fact that the resume I submitted contained a small mistake. I’m now attaching an updated copy of my resume. Please, refer to this version when you review my qualifications for the job.\nThank you,\n[your name]\nWhat to do once you've made a mistake \nIf you send your seemingly perfect resume, only to notice a typo or two later, don’t panic. Be kind to yourself, it’s not the end of the world.\nMany people have actually been hired for jobs despite typos and other mistakes on their resumes. We’re all human beings and make mistakes on a daily basis. However, there are some methods that can eliminate the possibility they’ll ruin your resume.\n\nWhat can you learn from this? \nThere are several lectures you can learn for the future:\nThe next time you're sending your application, after running it through a spell checker program (such as Grammarly), proofread it once again. \nGive yourself a day or two after you finish writing your resume. Only then return to it and look for mistakes with fresh eyes. \nAlso, make sure that someone else proofreads your resume. A couple of eagle-eyed friends scanning your resume before you apply for your next job can be very helpful. They'll be far more likely to catch any formatting, grammar, spelling, or timeline issues that you may have missed.\nLast but not least, invest some time into regular maintenance. Update your resume every now and then to have an up-to-date, thoroughly proofread career document. This will help you be ready the next time an unexpected opportunity comes your way.","Meta Description":"Learn how to Did You Write a Mistake on Your Resume?

(+Examples)\n\nAlthough these two career documents are both used as part of job applications, they're not interchangeable. Differences between a resume and a CV are many.\nAnd anyone hoping to score a new job should be able to tell them apart.\nThe first thing you need to realise is that resumes revolve around your competencies. These personal marketing documents showcase your skills, notable achievements and work experience in a concise and powerful way.\nOn the contrary, CVs are based on your credentials. For that reason, job seekers usually use them for positions in academia, scientific research and medical fields. As opposed to the brevity of the resume, CVs provide information about your whole career.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nThe curriculum vitae (CV)\nCV Example: New York University Associate Director\nThe resume\nResume Example: Intel IT Analyst\nCVs and resumes around the world\nDifferences between resume and CV\nThe curriculum vitae (CV)\n\"CV\" is short for Curriculum Vitae. The phrase comes from Latin and means 'course of life'.\nA CV is an in-depth career document that provides extensive information about your academic and research background. Besides that, any good CV should include a basic contact information.\nThe chronological order of the included information makes it easy for the reader to get a good idea of the candidate's full career path. In the end, everything is as detailed and comprehensive as it can be.\nApples and oranges?\nWhether you create a resume or CV, you will always stand out.\nCreate resume or CV\nAs a result, CVs tend to run much longer than a resume. Anything between 1-10 pages is perfectly acceptable.\nUnlike resumes, CVs are static. Tailoring them to different positions is not an option. On the other hand, that doesn't mean that you should never update your CV. On the contrary, each time you get an academic or professional achievement, add it to your CV. You should always keep it up to date.\nCV Example: New York University Associate Director\nNew York University Associate Director\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nWhat to include in a CV:\nIntroduction\nFull name and contact information\nProfessional profile, personal statement, summary or research objective\nEducation\nAwards and honors\nGrants and fellowships\nPublications\nConferences and courses\nAcademic memberships\nExperience\nResearch and lab experience \nGraduate fieldwork\nTeaching experience\nWork experience\nSkills\nCertifications\nProfessional skills\nSoft and transferable skills\nLanguages\nReferences\n\nThe resume\nThe resume — or résumé, is originally a French word that means “to sum up”. It's the most common career document that job seekers use. Put simply, the resume is a concise summary of your education, work history, credentials, achievements and skills. \nSuccessful resumes go straight to the point. After all, its purpose is to make you stand out from the competition. That's why you should focus only on those career details that can help you land a job. Feel free to drop any items that may seem irrelevant to the job you're applying to.\nMost jobs call for a tailored resume that will reflect its requirements. Because of that, it's in your best interest to do so and include keywords, relevant work experience and skills.\nDue to their brevity, resumes are usually one page long. However, if you're a seasoned professional with years of relevant work experience, feel free to use as much space as you need. \nVisual aids that facilitate readability and retain the reader's attention are also frequent. Don't be afraid to use bulleted and numbered lists, bold fonts, different font sizes and multiple columns.\nResumes are highly customizable and allow for some creativity when it comes to formatting. This allows you to shuffle the sections around to better match the employer's expectations. \nThere are three options to choose from — chronological, functional or hybrid resume. Each of them comes with certain pros and cons. It's up to you to figure out which one works the best for you.\nResume Example: Intel IT Analyst\nIntel IT Analyst\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nWhat to include in a resume:\nFull name and contact information\nResume summary, personal statement or resume objective\nWork experience\nEducation\nSkills\nSoft skills\nProfessional skills\nLanguages\nAdditional sections\nCertifications\nAwards\nCourses\nPublications\nConferences, etc.\nReferences\nNaturally, resumes are not standalone career documents. If you feel the need to provide more information about why you're applying for the job, attach a cover letter.\nCover letters are an optional feature. They build upon the skills and experiences mentioned in your resume. In addition to that, they allow you to talk about the ways in which you can be beneficial to the company and help them grow.  \n\nStill not sure what to include in each document? Learn about the differences between the cover letter vs resume and how they complement each other.\nCVs and resumes around the world\nPeople in different countries use the terms \"CV' and \"resume\" in different ways.\nIn the US and Canada, CVs are used only for academic or research-oriented positions. Resumes are used for the rest.\nThroughout Europe and New Zealand, the term \"CV\" is used in all contexts to describe an equivalent of a US resume. In both cases, it's a brief and concise document you use to apply for any kind of job.\nDifferences between resume and CV\nIn a nutshell, the three primary differences between the two lie in their purpose, content and length. \nResume\nPurpose: All-around career document for virtually any position.\nContent: Summarises your skills and work experience.\nLength: Short — usually 1–2 pages long.\nCustomization: Highly customizable. It should match the job advertisement — no strictly set formatting rules or section order.\nCV\nPurpose: Mostly used in academic settings.\nContent: A full account of your academic and professional career.\nLength: No limits — covers your entire career.\nCustomization: Fairly limited — a standardized chronological account of your career.\nFor more information, check out our free career ebook.

To secure your position, however, you first need an impressive CV for your PhD application.\nEarning a PhD degree requires you to produce extensive research in a narrowly defined subject within a certain discipline and to make a considerable original contribution to your field.\nHence why PhD programs are always very selective. The admission rates hover around 10% and only about half of the admitted candidates actually finish the degree, according to a recent psychology research.\nAs a result, less than 1% of the population attains a PhD.\nSo, how do you become a part of the 1%?\nThe process of attaining a PhD starts with a strong application which includes an impressive academic CV.\nA CV for PhD application needs to be carefully crafted, well formatted, and contain specific sections.\nWe'll show you how to craft a stellar PhD application CV, and a sample academic CV from a real person admitted to a PhD program in France.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nWhat is an academic CV?\nWhat to include in an academic CV for PhD application?\nHow to write an academic CV for a PhD application?\nTips on how to write a CV for PhD application\nHow to tailor your CV for different PhD programs\nPhD CV example\nWhat is an academic CV?\nFirst, there are two types of career documents job seekers widely use. A resume and a Curriculum Vitae (CV).\nThese two documents are similar but not identical.\nSo, let's have a look at the key differences between a CV vs a resume:\nA resume is used when applying for a position in industry, non-profits, or the public sector. It should focus on skills and past experience while being tailored to a specific job position. The length of the document shouldn't be more than 1 or 2 pages.\nA curriculum vitae (CV) is used when applying for positions in academia, science, or medicine. It focuses on education, research background and scholarly accomplishments. Finally, its length depends on the number of references, publications, etc.\nThere are even more types of CVs. A general CV, an industry (professional) CV, or an academic (research) CV — which is exactly the one you'll need.\nIn a nutshell, an academic CV is a career document that provides extensive information about your educational and research background. Scholars and researchers use this document when applying for jobs in academia — such as a PhD application.\nLastly, an academic resume is a term you can often come across, too. To avoid any confusion, it's the same as an academic CV. A more appropriate term is, however, the latter.\n\nWhat to include in an academic CV for PhD application?\nRules are important in academia. That's why all academic CVs usually follow pretty strict structures regarding their content and formatting.\nFirst, let's have a look at the resume sections you should include in a CV for PhD application:\nContact information. Include your full name, email, phone number, and location.\n(Research) objective. A concise, brief paragraph outlining your research plans and strategies.\nEducation. It should form the bulk of your CV and detail you educational background.\n(Research) experience. Your research experience can often set you apart from other candidates.\nPublications. Include anything from journal articles, published reports, to your research dissertation.\nAwards. Mention all awards and accomplishments you’ve received in reverse chronological order.\nSkills. These should be relevant to the PhD project or show that you have what it takes to succeed as a researcher.\nReferences. Finally, try to include at least two references, such as your dissertation supervisor and one other member of staff.\nLet's have a closer look at each of the 8 CV sections in the next chapter.\n\nHow to write an academic CV for a PhD application?\nApplying for a PhD will be a lot less stressful if you follow this quick guide on how to write a CV for a PhD application:\nStart by entering your contact information.\nYou should always start your CV or your resume by providing your contact details to form the CV header. Include your full name, your professional email address, and your mobile number.\n\nAdditionally, you can include your location. However, we don't advise including your full home address for privacy reasons. Entering the country and city you reside in is usually enough.\n\nSince a CV is a bit different than a resume, we don't recommend including links to your social media.\nCome up with a suitable research objective.\nResearch objective is basically a brief paragraph at the beginning of your CV outlining your research plans, interests, and strategies.\n\nIt paints a picture of you as a person and will guarantee that the admissions committee will be interested in reading and learning more about your professional background.\n\nYour research plans and strategies should align with the PhD project you're applying for. Hence, read the project description carefully and make sure to tailor your objective accordingly. Ideally, without making stuff up.\nFocus on your educational background.\nThe education section should form the bulk of an academic CV. No one expects a potential PhD candidate to have 10 years of experience in the field. But what's expected is an appropriate educational background.\n\nA common practice is to list your education in a reverse chronological order. This means listing your Master's degree first and then a Bachelor's degree.\n\nFor each degree, provide the full name of the degree, the type, its duration, the relevant courses and modules, the corresponding (or expected) marks, GPA, and any relevant projects or presentations. Also, include the name and the description of your final year dissertation project.\nSummarize your research experience.\nIn this section, introduce all of the research projects you worked on, whether they were a part of your undergraduate degree, your master's degree, or you have undertaken this project elsewhere.\n\nYou can include any voluntary, part-time, or full-time work experience you deem relevant for the PhD project of your choice.\n\nFor instance, skip the part-time bartending job and rather include a teaching experience or a voluntary project you undertook.\nOutline the publications you're most proud of.\nOf course, it's okay if you don't have any publications yet. If that's the case, simply skip this section. However, if you do have any work published at this stage, list it in this section.\n\nThe publications can include anything from journal articles, published reports, contributions to peer-reviewed journals, or an adaptation of your dissertation project.\n\nMake sure to check the citation style your institution or field prefers and use it consistently in your publications section. The most common ones are APA, MLA, and Chicago.\nShow off your awards and accomplishments.\nIn this CV section, list relevant honors, achievements, or awards you earned for going beyond average — again in reversed chronological order.\n\nIt includes scholarships, university fellowships, competitions, work-related awards, or academic awards.\n\nFor instance, you can mention a very high GPA, subject-specific awards, or any grants you received. However, keep in mind that mentioning how much money was involved is only common in scientific fields.\nSkills, skills, skills.\nThe skills you mention in your academic CV should be relevant to the PhD project you're applying for or show that you have what it takes to succeed as a researcher.\n\nBetween the two types of skills, hard and soft, hard skills are more appropriate to include in your CV for PhD application. Examples of hard skills include Python, data analysis, polymer synthesis, C++, ChemDraw, Ahrefs, languages, or other computer skills.\n\nHowever, completing a PhD degree usually also involves demonstrating your teaching abilities. For this reason, listing soft skills such as a good oral communication and presenting is also a good idea.\nConclude by listing a couple of references.\nWhile a references section in a regular resume is pretty much redundant, in a CV for PhD application it's a must-have. Why? Well, having a person attest to your skills and achievements is a great way to leverage your professional experience.\n\nThe person you ask should be articulate and in a reputable position. Your best bet is to ask your dissertation supervisor, a professor you had a good relationship with, or one who taught the subject most relevant for the desired PhD program.\n\nFinally, don't forget that your references have to agree with having their contact information shared, first. Read our quick guide on how do you ask someone to be your reference.\n\nTips on how to write a CV for PhD application\nApart from making sure the content of your CV is spot on, you should also follow some well-established formatting tips.\nA clear layout and composition ensure your CV is professional and easy to read.\nHere are a few tips to help you achieve that:\nKeep the formatting consistent. If you choose a certain font type and size, stick to it. The same goes for margins, spacing, and capitalization.\nLess is often more. It might be tempting to use bolding, italics, or underlining in order to make the document \"easy\" to read. However, an excessive use of these features actually has the exact opposite effect.\nAvoid long paragraphs. A CV is all about providing objective facts regarding your professional background. Hence, no need to provide generic statements or go into too much detail. And if you happen to write more text, you can always divide it using bullet points.\nUse professional language. It goes without saying, but don't use slang. Similarly, use professional jargon and abbreviations within reasonable limits.\nDon't limit yourself to one or two pages. The length of your academic CV depends on the number of publications, awards, references, and experiences. Unlike a resume, a CV is a complete summary of your academic and professional background.\nConvert your CV to PDF. Doing this considerably reduces the risk of compatibility and formatting issues. A PDF file keeps your formatting intact across various devices.\nToo much to keep in mind? Kickresume's CV & resume builder can save you the headache and provides useful templates with appropriate formatting designed by career professionals.\nHow to tailor your CV for different PhD programs\nWhen applying for different PhD programs, it's crucial to tailor your academic CV to suit each specific program. \nThis doesn't just improve your chances of catching the eye of admissions committees; it demonstrates your genuine interest and alignment with their goals. \nTo effectively tailor your CV for different PhD programs, follow these three tips:\n#1 Understand program requirements and values\nHow do you do that? Start with in-depth research about the PhD program:\nVisit the program's website\nLook at the curriculum\nAttend open days\nIf possible, reach out to alumni \nOnce you have a clear picture of the program's values and requirements, you can begin to customize your CV. \nFor example: If a program emphasizes community outreach, you might highlight your involvement in science education for underprivileged youths or your participation in community-based research projects. \nThis demonstrates not only your alignment with their values but also your active contribution to areas they care about.\n#2 Emphasize transferable skills for PhD programs\nThis applies to people switching fields or applying to a program that isn't a direct continuation of your undergraduate degree. \nLet's say you're moving from a background in chemistry to a PhD in molecular biology. \nIt's crucial to highlight how your analytical skills, understanding of chemical processes, and any lab work or research experience directly apply to molecular biology. \nFor instance: Discuss your experience with techniques that are common in both fields, like chromatography or spectrometry, and how they've prepared you for the research you aim to conduct in molecular biology. \nTailoring your CV in this manner demonstrates your ability to bridge different disciplines and apply your skills in new contexts.\n#3 Adapt your CV for international PhD programs\nAdapting your CV for international programs involves more than just translating it into another language. \nStart by researching the academic culture and CV formats preferred in the country you're applying to. This might include:\nthe preferred length\nwhether to include personal information such as a photo\nemphasis on certain types of experience or qualifications\nFor instance: in some countries, a detailed list of courses and grades might be important, while in others, a focus on research experience and publications is key. \nWebsites of the target universities, country-specific academic career resources, advice from current international students, or even online forums like Reddit are invaluable for this purpose.\nPhD CV example\nFinally, to help you tie everything we talked about together, we thought one picture is worth a thousand words.\nHere's a CV sample from a person who managed to get accepted into a PhD program at the university of Lyon in France.\nThere are several things Herrera included to ensure her CV was successful:\nA complete professional and academic background. We can see that this section forms the bulk of the resume. As it should.\nPlenty of hard skills. Herrera included 7 hard technical skills and multiple languages. All of these skills are very valuable in academia.\nA succinct description of all projects. She includes the full name of the projects, their duration, and theme.\nReferences, publications, and certifications. All of these sections are included in the full version of this resume and can be found by clicking the button below the sample CV.","URL Slug":"cv-for-phd-application:-how-to-write-one-like-a-tr","Meta Description":"Learn how to CV for PhD Application: How to Write One Like a True Scholar (+CV Example) and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

You know which sections to include, what type of power words to use and what kind of information to emphasize.\nThe cover letter is different. As opposed to the resume, in the world of the cover letter, everything is possible. There are many things that can help you shine — but just as many that can send your application straight to the proverbial bin.\nThat's why we've decided to go into more detail and show you what a good cover letter looks like.\nHere's the first one in a series — a cover letter that helped someone score a job as Junior Product Manager Hired at IBM.\nIBM Junior Product Manager Cover Letter Sample\n\nThis cover letter sample was provided by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n1.

Answer their burning questions \n\"Why me?\"\n\"Why IBM-Client Innovation Centre?\"\n\"Why this role?\"\nRecruiters will typically want to ask you a few basic questions. It's a routine that needs to be done and you can take advantage of that.\nSo instead of waiting for the actual interview, use your cover letter to present your answers. It's a super effective method how to begin a cover letter. Not only will it help you get ahead of your competition, but you'll also clear out space for more interesting answers once you meet in person.\nYour cover letter can be even better.\nGet your dream job with a new cover letter.\nCreate cover letter\n2. Stay humble\n\"However, life is an ongoing journey and I keep learning and exploring, currently doing online courses in Innovation Management (Coursera), The Art of Storytelling (Khan Academy) and Digital Marketing (LinkedIn learning).\"\nNo one really wants to hire job seekers with a highly overrated opinion of themselves. So even if you do see yourself as an up-and-coming industry professional with valuable skills, remember to infuse your cover letter with some genuine modesty.\nJunior positions — in particular — require you to stay humble and show you're flexible enough to work with those more experienced than you.\nPresent your life as one of continuous learning. Show that you've already set off on the journey you want to undertake to advance your career and be beneficial to the job you're applying for.\n3. Present your portfolio\n\"I started thinking about IBM as a career possibility this spring/summer, when I managed to successfully present myself with a winning solution of a project for IBM Slovakia – “Are you living in reality” (see https://davidmantic.wixsite.com/ibm-challenge).\"\nYour cover letter is the place to talk about your accomplishments, products, prizes and awards. But talking might not be enough. If you have something to show, do so.\nRegardless of the platform — be it Twitter, LinkedIn, Behance, your blog or personal website — include a link to demonstrate you've made an impact and achieved something you're proud of.\n4. Appearance matters\n\"My practical experience might be categorised in three blocks:\"\n\"Creating solutions for given company problems ...\"\n\"Working on my own business project ...\"\n\"Working for a startup as part of my master thesis …\"\nWatch out to maintain the neat design of your cover letter. Indentation, bullet points, paragraphing, the balance of white space and print — use everything to make it readable and pleasant to look at.\nThe content matters, but so does the formatting. If you succeed in taking care of both, you're halfway there.\nFor example, you may want to use bullet points to break down a larger chunk of text or just list things that look better in a column rather than in a row. This way you'll present information in a more structured way and retain the reader's attention for a much longer time.\nTo get inspired, take a deep dive into our extensive collection of cover letter samples.\n5. Wrap up with style\n\"Dear recruiting team, I have introduced the three hiring reasons why I am applying for a graduate trainee position. Since I have been living in three different countries and was part of various international groups, I think that this adaptability together with the presented skills and personal traits are suitable for this position and IBM culture itself.\"\nYour conclusion resembles your elevator pitch. It's the place to round off your presentation with the most important information. If you succeed, you'll convince the reader to take further action.\nChances are some recruiters will read this section first and only then decide if they want to read the rest.

Whether it's for a technical job or not, certain skills are must-haves.\nNow, let's focus on how best to present these skills on your resume.\nThere are two effective ways to showcase your computer skills on your resume:\nCreating a separate skills section. List each skill clearly, providing a quick snapshot of your abilities. It's a neat and efficient approach but may not give a complete picture of how you use these skills. You can also divide the skills section into multiple categories, such as technical, soft skills, languages, etc.\nIntegrate your computer skills within your work experience descriptions. For example, adding bullet points like \"Implemented encryption protocols to ensure customer data security\" under a job role. This approach illustrates not just what skills you have, but how you've effectively used them in real-world situations.\nBoth methods have their strengths, so choose one that best matches your experience and the job you're applying for. Remember, a well-presented skillset can make a significant difference.\nHere's a real-life example for you.

Get Hired Fast With This Veteran Resume Guide\n\nIf you’re a military veteran, looking for a civilian job can feel like traveling to a very different world.

This guide will help you overcome most obstacles and succeed in launching a new career.\n\nLet’s take it from the top — by putting together your battle-ready military veteran resume.\n\nIt’s a part of your application that will play one of the main roles in helping you make a smooth transition into civilian life.\n\nHowever, to reach the port you must learn to navigate the sea of new career opportunities and master the art of translating your military experience into civilian terms.\n\nBefore starting to write your veteran resume, reserve some time determining what precisely it is you're seeking in your future career. Research occupations closest to the jobs you held while on duty. Try to find industries that normally employ people with your training and skills.\n\nDon’t also hesitate to contact other former members of the military that have already switched to a civilian career. These people can give you useful tips and advice that will help you along the way.\n\nSo, where to start looking for a job? Here are a couple of websites helping military veterans find meaningful post-service careers:\n\nBy the end of our guide, you will end up with an all-in-one document that will summarize your professional past, highlight your military achievements and make clear what you’re passionate about.\n\nOnce you determine what kind of job you’d like to apply to, you can customize your veteran resume to address the requirements of a specific position.\n\nIt’s important to focus your skills and experiences to appear uniquely suited for the job. Your resume will then act as a homing missile rather than just being a carpet-bombing attempt of an overly generic application.\n\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n\n1.

Skip the military jargon\nA military resume and a civilian resume are two completely different beasts.\n\nYour veteran resume is sure to get more attention if you make some effort and change the military parlance into more common vernacular.\n\nFirst of all, you need to become more approachable. Chances are that the recruiters aren’t veterans. Therefore you should start by broadening your specific skills into abilities that your target company could find useful.\n\nDemilitarize your Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), job titles, accomplishments, duties, and awards so they can resonate more with civilian hiring managers.\n\nIn fact, translating your military skills and experience into easy-to-understand civilian terms is a no-brainer. There are tons of sites available to convert them for you. They’ll take your military branch, MOS code or job title and come up with a list a list of civilian job titles and in some cases, actual open positions.\n\nDone with the military?\nGet a new job 60% faster with a standout resume.\n\nCreate resume\nCheck them out:\n\nCareerOneStop’s Military to Civilian Occupation Translator. It’s sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, so the information provided is reliable.\nO*Net OnLine’s Military Crosswalk Search\nTAOnline’s MOS Code to Civilian Occupations Translator\nTAOnline’s Jobsaurus. How to describe your military experience in civilian terms.\nMilitary.com’s Skills Translator\nVet’s GOV Skills Translator\nPay attention to any abbreviations and acronyms that you’d like to use in your resume. Although they are common in the military, most civilians have no clue what they mean. Take time to spell them out for your potential employer.\n\n3. Identify your value and skills\nYes, you definitely need to frame your resume in a civilian format. But on the other hand, don’t shy away from stating why military experience is an invaluable asset that recruiters should be aware of.\n\nIt doesn’t really matter if you were involved in tactical operations, communications, engineering, or artillery. All of these are useful and marketable skills that you can apply directly to the civilian workplace.\n\nInstead of just listing the assigned responsibilities, you need to explore the power of paraphrasing. Describe the skills that you gained from your role in the military. Show off your technical, interpersonal, and leadership prowess.\n\nFor example, let’s say you worked in artillery. You definitely don’t want to say you shot at people or killed someone. Talk about the ability to work under pressure and assess situations quickly instead.\n\nAnother example. As a member of the infantry, you might want to say you patrolled a base and engaged in combat. But what about just claiming that you created a safe environment for 500 people?\n\nveteran resume\n4. Prioritize the details\nRemember that your veteran resume is not your autobiography. It’s impossible to describe in detail everything you’ve done in your entire military career.\n\nFrankly speaking, HR managers have too little time for too many applications. Make their job easier. The shorter you make your resume, the better.\n\nNarrow down the content of your resume to only what’s pertinent to the job opening. It’s just like an advertisement. Put a spotlight on your selling points and exclude everything that’s irrelevant for the moment being.\n\nIdeally, your resume shouldn’t extend over one page. Once it does, it’s extremely easy to lose the reader's attention.\n\n5. Use action verbs and power adjectives\nRecruiters are not fond of hearing the same old stories over and over again. Only by making conscious decisions can you bring fresh, authentic language to your veteran resume.\n\nGet rid of those worn-out phrases and words. Write short descriptions starting with action verbs instead:\n\nSupervised and helped develop a new surveillance system that increased productivity by 55%.\nDemonstrated and presented proper procedures for testing smoke producing munitions.\nSuccessfully led 20 airmen in key projects at Creech Air Force Base. We met all milestones and deliverables in record time.\nDirected new method of operations for wide-ranging management of military construction projects.\nNegotiated and administered over $10 million worth of military contracts annually.  \nCoordinated daily office routines for 30 staff members.\nOnce your verbs start feeling good, it’s time to harness the power of adjectives, too. Use them to add color to your personality and skills.\n\n6. Make your veteran resume easy to read\nDon’t forget to make your resume stand out and be visually appealing. Keep these three areas in check:\n\nBullet points. Use them especially when listing your skills, responsibilities or qualifications.\n\nHeadings and sections. Give your veteran resume some structure and divide it into sections. Use a larger font for headings and bold them.\n\nFonts. Tradition wins over creativity. Being unconventional almost never pays off, so it’s better to stick with basic fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, Helvetica, Georgia or Calibri.\n\nveteran resume\n7. Attach the cover letter\nYour resume is an inevitable part of your application. But a strategically targeted cover letter can be your ultimate weapon to win the job.\n\nIt lets you address a particular job and employer directly. Don’t ever use the generic To Whom It May Concern. Do your homework to find out the name of the HR manager who will be reviewing the application.\n\nAlso, don't use it to summarize your resume. Build upon the information and explain why the job appeals to you and what’s your motivation behind your application. Don’t forget to emphasize any specific skills that make you qualified for the position.\n\nIf you want to create an outstanding cover letter that will resonate your passion for the job, check out also our cover letter guide.\n\n8. Emphasize your specialized training and educational background\nUndoubtedly, the military provides some of the best leadership and technical training in the country.\n\nFeaturing your specialized training will send a clear signal about the types of skills you have developed in the service. This will help dispel any doubts about your job qualifications right off the bat.\n\nYour life before the military matters, too. Most veterans have some educational background outside of what they gained through the military service. So if you attended any type of technical school, vocational training or university, put it into your resume.\n\nDon’t forget to include the details, too — the dates you studied, your major/focus and other non-military certifications you’ve received.\n\n9. Put your awards and accomplishments on display\nAs a veteran, you’ve surely had opportunities for advancement and commendation. Lay out a blueprint of your military career to indicate you performed your duty well and advanced your career accordingly.\n\nUse numbers to quantify your achievements whenever you see it fit. What was the number of soldiers under your supervision? How many patrols a week did you carry out? And how many awards and medals did you earn?\n\nAcronyms never tell the whole story. When listing the actual awards, add one or two sentences about why you got them to describe your accomplishments in civilian terms.\n\nFirst, list the recognitions in a separate Awards section. Then elaborate on them in your Work experience section to show you’ve delivered outstanding military service:\n\nAwards. Navy/USMC Achievement Medal, 12 Air Medals, etc.\nWork experience. Earned numerous awards, including Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal and numerous Air Medals for the participation in border patrolling, medical evacuations of military and civilians, and special operations.\nveteran resume\n10. Proofread, proofread, proofread\nI bet you wouldn’t ever think of entering combat without double-checking every single little detail like the supply of ammunition or the functionality of your gun.\n\nThe same goes for your resume. Don’t miss proofreading it before you hit the Send button on your keyboard. Take some time to review your veteran resume for basic mechanics like format, spelling, dates and overall design.\n\nThis will give you 100% confidence that you’ve done a great job in creating a bulletproof document that conveys everything you want recruiters to know about you and your military career.\n\nThe times they are a changin'\nIt's true that career changes are hard. But as a military veteran, you've been shaped by your unique experience and developed skills that many recruiters look for.\n\nHopefully, this guide has shown you a way how to advance your career and make a smooth transition into civilian life. If you use it to your advantage, there's a land of success lying ahead of you.\n\nGood luck!\n\nReady to navigate the civilian job market after a military career? We've got your six. Take your LinkedIn profile and let's mold it into a polished resume that translates your invaluable military skills into a language employers love."}}]}

And, have you considered exploring this popular online forum to uncover what the best resume advice according to Reddit is?\nOf course, Reddit can be notoriously difficult to navigate and not all of its users actually know what they're talking about.\nStill, Reddit and other public forums can be valuable sources of first-hand experience in all things resume. \nWe've painstakingly sifted through countless subreddits, all dedicated to resume writing and career tips, to save you the trouble.\nNow, we present to you the crème-de-la-crème of Reddit resume advice. \nIn this article, you'll find:\n6 best resume advice according to Reddit;\nWhat we think about them; \nAnd, of course, examples. \n\nTL;DR: 5 Best resume advice according to reddit\nFirst, for those in a hurry, here's the TL;DR version of our top five resume advice gathered from Reddit:\nUse a single column layout to pass the ATS.\nDon't name your resume 'resume.pdf'.\nKeep you job descriptions short. Use bullet points and action verbs.\nUse numbers to quantify your achievements.\nLess is more for both word count & job applications per day.\nUse resume builders to make your life easier.\nNow, let's look at the best resume advice according to Reddit users more closely. Here's what we think:\n1. Use a single column layout to pass the ATS\nSource: Reddit\nIf you thought that layout doesn't play any significant role in the success rate of your resume, you thought wrong!\nIn case the company you're applying to uses an Applicant Tracking System, always opt for a single column layout. \nThe reason? ATS compatibility. \nEven though all ATSs are designed to read text from top to bottom, left to right, not every ATS is programmed to distinguish between columns. \nAnd you just can't know with certainty which software you'll encounter. Therefore, reduce the risk of your resume being incorrectly processed or rejected by picking a one-column ATS friendly resume template. This will make the process of parsing and interpreting information easier and safer.\nHOWEVER. That doesn't mean you should discard the two-column resume all-together. Here are some reasons why a two-column layout can still be beneficial:\nNon-ATS employers. Many companies still don't use ATS systems, making the ATS compatibility argument less relevant in these cases. For these employers, the visual and organizational benefits of a two-column layout could be more advantageous.\nAesthetics. A two-column format can be more visually engaging, making your resume stand out.\nEase of reading. Smaller chunks of information can make the resume easier for the human eye to navigate.\nSpace management. For those with less experience, a two-column layout can help evenly distribute text and avoid large empty spaces.\nStrategic organization. It allows for a more strategic presentation of information, guiding the recruiter's eyes through your resume efficiently.\nMoreover, if you're just entering the workforce with no experience, your resume is probably still quite sparse. \nBecause of this, you may end up with a large, unattractive empty space at the bottom of your document. And with one-column structure resumes, this is often the case. \nThere' s an easy fix! Organizing your resume sections into a two-column structure can help spread the text more evenly.  \n2. Don't name your resume 'resume.pdf'\nSource: Reddit\nIndeed, putting together a good resume is quite a tedious process.\nThere're so many rules and principles to think about, for instance:\nEvery single resume section, whether it be the resume summary, work experience section, education section, skills section, or any other optional section, requires your full and undivided attention. \nYou must remember to always tailor your resume to fit a specific job description. \nNot to mention the subsequent formatting and proofreading!\nBy the time you've finished writing your resume, you're likely mentally drained. \nIt's at this time that errors creep out from the most unexpected places.\nOne such error is not naming your resume file appropriately.\nHow to name your resume file: step-by-step.\nWhen naming your resume file for submission, it's important to consider clarity, professionalism, and the likelihood of it being easily found by the recruiters. \nHere are our recommendations for naming your resume file:\nUse your name. Start with your full name. This is the most crucial piece of information because it clearly identifies the document as yours. For example, \"PeterStones\".\nSpecify the document type. Make it clear that the document is a resume. This helps distinguish your resume from other documents like a cover letter. For example, \"Resume\".\nAdd the job title. This can be particularly helpful if you are sending the resume directly to a hiring manager. For example, \"ProductManager\".\nUse a professional format. Avoid using any unnecessary symbols or fancy formatting. Underscores (_) or hyphens (-) are acceptable to separate words.\nA good file name for your resume could look like this: \"PeterStones_Resume_ProductManager.pdf\".\nFinally, before hitting send, consider carefully what to write in an email when sending a resume. Of course, when you're applying for a job, every detail matters. Don't neglect the content of your email – it's also responsible for making a positive first impression.\n3. Keep your job descriptions short. Use bullet points and action verbs\nSource: Reddit\nUndoubtedly, you know that the work experience section is the heart and soul of your resume. \nThe recruiters always pay it the most attention, and so you need to be extra diligent and patient while writing about your past employment. \nConsequently, many will try to fit in as much information as humanly possible, disregarding the readability and quality of their entries. To steer clear from such mistake, follow these two simple principles:\nOrganize your work descriptions into bullet points. Under each work experience entry, list 4-5 bullet points underlining your most notable responsibilities and achievements. That is to say, you should focus on demonstrating the impact your presence had on your former employment, rather than just stating your daily duties. \nOpen the said bullet points with action verbs. The recruiters don't care about long winding sentences! That's why it's a good idea to start each bullet point with an action verb. This will not only make your writing more concise, but it'll also depict you as a proactive, and therefore valuable, employee.\nFor example, a well conceptualized work entry description can look like this:\nWork experience entry example:\nSenior Product Manager\nXYZ Tech Solutions, New York, NY | June 2019 – Present\nLed a team of 8 in the development of an innovative mobile application, increasing user retention by 35% within six months.\nCollaborated with cross-departmental teams to streamline product delivery, reducing time-to-market by 20%.\nManaged product lifecycle from concept to launch, including market analysis, positioning, and rollout strategy.\nOversaw a budget of $1M, optimizing resource allocation and cutting costs by 15% without impacting product quality.\n \n4. Use numbers to quantify your achievements\nSource: Reddit\nThis is another great resume advice according to a Reddit user!\nThe recruiters adore to see numbers in your resume! Why, you ask?\nIt makes life a bit easier for them. By quantifying your accomplishments, you simultaneously allow recruiters to better gauge your abilities; and add more weight to your words. \nBe as specific as you can - numbers are universal. \nStruggling to figure out how to incorporate numbers into your resume? Here are few examples of what you can quantify:\nRevenue and sales increases. If you contributed to growing revenue or sales, specify the percentage or dollar amount of the increase. For example: \"Boosted sales by 20% within a six-month period.\"\nCost reduction. Similarly, if you implemented strategies that reduced costs, mention the amount or percentage saved. For example: \"Cut operational costs by 15% through process optimization.\"\nTime efficiency. If you streamlined processes, indicate how much time was saved. For example: \"Reduced project turnaround time by 30%.\"\nTeam management. If you manage a team, you can specify the number of people you supervise. For example: \"Led a team of 12 sales professionals.\"\nProject scope and delivery. Quantify the size or value of the projects you managed, then mention if you delivered them under budget or ahead of schedule. For example:  \"Managed projects worth $2M, consistently delivering 10% under budget.\"\nTraining and development. If you were involved in training, mention the number of people you trained or the improvement in performance post-training. For example: \"Trained over 30 employees, leading to a 40% increase in overall team efficiency.\"\n5. Less is more for both word count & job applications per day\nSource: Reddit\nResume advice two-in-one!\nAs this Reddit user rightly pointed out, less is sometimes more. \nThis is especially true when it comes to the content of your resume as well as the amount of job applications you send out each day.\nWhen crafting your resume, keep in mind that you must show the recruiters that you have everything they're looking for. Chances are, you actually have much more – more diverse job experience; more interesting hobbies; or more fulfilling volunteer work you'd like to share with them. \nDon't!\nObviously, resumes have their length limitations. Once you've started to write yours, you'll soon learn that you have to be picky! \nRecruiters prefer resumes that are focused, relevant, and straight-to-the-point. In other words, don't make them read information they didn't ask for. \nThe same applies to applying for jobs.\nMany in this situation start panic-applying to every single job posting they find. Because they assume that the more applications they send, the bigger their chances at landing a job will be. \nMakes sense right?\nIn theory, maybe. In practice? Hardly!\nBelieve it or not, there's such a thing as sending too many applications. Basically, if your solely focus on the quantity of applications, you're running the risk of sacrificing their quality. \nAnd that is a problem. If you'd like to learn how to go about this problem, including tips on how to manage the pressure of job hunting, take a look at what research says about the ideal number of job applications.\n6. Use resume builders to make your life easier\nSource: Reddit\nNow, hand over your heart!\nWould you prefer to sit in front of your computer for hours, battling with Microsoft Word and its many settings? Trying to create a perfect resume design from scratch? \nAdmit it, even the thought of setting margins and spacing makes you roll your eyes. \nHence, arguably the best resume advice according to reddit is to make a resume with an online resume builder to avoid these inconveniences (politely said).\nNo need to scratch your head over a layout or the best colour palette! Instead, simply pick a resume template that best suits your needs (both aesthetic and practical), fill in all your information, and watch your resume come to life in seconds. \nAdditionally, resume builders can proofread and correct any misspellings or typos you might've otherwise missed. \nSounds good? If so, your perfect resume is one click away.\nResume template by Kickresume\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nCreate resume\nKey Takeaways: Best resume advice according to Reddit\nIn conclusion, Reddit and other public forums can serve as a good starting point for seeking resume advice.\nApart from first-hand applicant experience, many posts are sumbitted by actual hiring managers.\nHowever, there's a lot to weed out first to find the best resume advice according to reddit.\nPlus, you should always compare your findings with reputable sources. Which is exactly what we did.\nUse a single column layout to pass the ATS.\nDon't forget to name your resume file appropriately.\nKeep your job descriptions short with bullet points and action verbs.\nUse numbers to quantify your achievements.\nKeep your resume concise and the number of daily applications reasonable. \nUse online tools (like Kickresume) to build your resume."}}]}

My Little Crazy Resume\n\nNo, this isn't a storytelling spreadsheet for second graders. This is actually a resume of an adult with some solid academic background in computer science and mathematics.\nNo matter how well it reads to a 7-year-old, there are a few problems that Joseph should've fixed before sending this resume to his potential employers (who might be well above 18 years old).\nConvert your LinkedIn profile into a resume.\nAvoid making your resume a big fail and create a stunning one with one-click LinkedIn resume import magic.\nImport LinkedIn profile\nThe lesson\nSteer clear of 'My Little Pony' resume design. Opt for a neat resume format with well-defined sections. Avoid chunks of text — use bullet points for clarity, making your resume skimmable at first glance.\nAvoid flashy graphic elements. Joseph should get rid of overly vibrant colors and elements that would divert the hiring manager's attention from his qualifications and skills.\nDon't use personal pronouns (and fairy tale creatures) in your resume. It's understood that a resume represents your own experiences, so there's no need to use \"I did this\", let alone to refer to yourself in the third person. And so, instead of \"He galloped off to work as a radio DJ …\", Joseph could perfectly state on his resume this: \"Hosted as a radio DJ, curating playlists and engaging listeners.\"\nTailor your resume to a specific job. The fact that Joseph had \"his own nuclear reactor to play with\", \"worked as a radio dj\", and \"dabbled in domestication\" makes us wonder what position he's applying for.\n2. Creepy Ricky Resume\n\nMr. Santangelo apparently knows his craft. But if he's scarier than Joker from Batman, who cares?\nSurprisingly, Ricky's self-presentation contains some basic structural elements. There's a mission statement \"get ready to get blown away by Ricky\" and a succinct profile summary \"Ricky's seen it all … knows how to go big\". The third paragraph offers fragments of his work experience and a bold vision for future \"now I'm ready for movies.\"\nAn indirect reference is not missing, either: \"MOVE OVER TOM CRUISE TIME FOR THE NEW F***ING BLOOD.\"\nThe lesson\nDon't use all caps. Using all caps can come across as shouting in written communication. In a resume, maintaining a professional tone is crucial, and all caps can undermine that professionalism.\nStay polite and don't ever swear. Your resume is a formal career document. \nGive your resume a bit of structure. Check out our resume format guide. \nBe specific about your achievements. The fact that you've \"seen it all\" sounds too vague (and a bit scary, to be honest).\n3. Baby Boss Resume\n\nNo matter how cute you looked as a baby, putting your baby photo on a resume isn’t appropriate. If it doesn't ruin your chances to land the job you want, it'll surely amuse your future employer (and earn you a nickname).\nSo, what does Jane Roe’s resume say? The baby's shooting for a managerial position. What's more, the profile summary says the two-year-old already has 4 years of experience in the industry. Pretty impressive for a toddler that's still waiting to celebrate her second birthday!\nThe lesson\nIf you want to use a photo on your resume, make sure it's an accurate representation of your current appearance.\nBaby photos on a resume are a colossal faux pas, rendering it unprofessional and unrefined.\n4. Drug Dealer's Resume\n\nLooking at this resume, we're quite sure that including an employment gap would be a better choice. Especially when your job title was \"Nefarious Dude\" and your professional experience consisted of illegal activities and serving time in jail. Unless, of course, you're trying to score a drug dealer job.\nOn the other hand, going from a drug dealer to graphic designer shows some dedication and progress. Yet, a graphic designer should know better when it's wise to use a title case.\nThe lesson\nList work experience that's relevant to the job you're applying for.\nUse action verbs and powerful adjectives in bulleted lists. Well-chosen action verbs and adjectives help your resume stand out. They make your achievements and qualifications more memorable, which can be an advantage in a competitive job market.\nUse title case only where it's necessary. Your bullet points in the work experience section certainly don't need them. Sentence case is generally easier to read because it resembles the structure of a typical sentence. It flows more naturally.\n5. Cinnamon WordArt Resume\n\nCinnamon, a WordArt enthusiast, surely seems unfazed by bad formatting. Featuring unconventional hobbies like \"ferret husbandry\" and \"spending time with old people at the end of their Golden Years\" may seem too bold. But nothing's too bold for Cinnamon — not even questionable language choices, such as references to \"vegetable people\" and \"retarded people\". \nIf nothing else, this resume proves that even if you want to \"serve the Lord,\" you still need to get some things right.\nThe lesson\nUse a traditional font like Arial, Times New Roman, Helvetica, Georgia or Calibri.\nInclude hobbies that are relevant to the job or can showcase skills that are transferable to the desired position.\nReplace bulky paragraphs with bullet points for better readability.\nAvoid unnecessary information. Mentioning that you \"Never got in trouble\" in school and \"passed classes\" is the same as if you mentioned that you \"never hit a coworker\" — admirable but also redundant (and suspicious). It's completely OK if your education section features only your academic achievements and qualifications.\nUse appropriate punctuation. Abusing quotation marks can cause confusion. And so, while you’re boasting about \"providing the \"delicious\" meals to all employees\", your potential boss may think you’re being ironic.\n6. Lorem Ipsum Resume\n\nWe can only imagine how the hiring manager hit an unexpected landmine, when they got to the placeholder sections of this resume. It certainly wouldn't be a problem if only your hobbies were \"placing your text here\" and \"deleting this text and heading…\"\nFailing to proofread your resume always comes at a cost. Be it missing characters, misspelled words or placeholder text, a silly mistake can decide your fate and instantly send your resume to the reject pile.\nThe lesson\nAlways proofread your resume before using it for job searching. To effectively proofread your resume, consider using tools like spelling and grammar checkers, and ask a trusted friend or colleague to review it as well. It's also helpful to take a break between writing and proofreading to look at your resume with fresh eyes.\nIf you're in the process of editing and drafting your resume, or starting off with a template, make sure to rename the file in your computer. This way you'll prevent yourself from sending in your unfinished resume and killing your job prospects before you even begin.\n7. HIRE ME OR DIE Resume\n\nThis eager job seeker clearly bet everything on oversharing unnecessary information with the hiring manager. \nSo, what do we know about her? She's too smart for just any job — she \"doesn't need a college\" because she's a \"self starter\". Plus, she can type \"like wicked fast!\". She and her ex just broke up because \"he was cheating\". And she also used to babysit Aubi, but she just can’t remember where \"they [Aubi's parents] lived or what they were called\".\nWe also learned that everyone except her mom, dad, best friend, and science teacher might have something negative to say about her. (She should've probably kept this to herself.)\nAnd how do we know she's eager? Well, we know it thanks to \"HIRE ME'' written over and over again at the bottom of the page. It’s perhaps the very last thing that'll boost this job seeker's prospects.\nThe lesson\nShare only what's relevant to the job position. It keeps your resume concise and focused on the skills, qualifications, and experiences that directly match the requirements of the job. This helps hiring managers quickly identify if you're fit for the role.\nNever share overly personal information on your resume. Including private information, such as family details, irrelevant hobbies, or political opinions, will clutter your resume and divert attention from your professional qualifications.\nUse the right formatting. Proper formatting, including clear headings, bullet points, and consistent fonts, makes your resume easy to read. Hiring managers often skim through resumes, so a well-formatted document ensures they can quickly find key information.\nDouble-check your spelling. Using \"accept\" for \"except\" or \"dallers\" for \"dollars\" won't get you far.\nKeep a professional tone. Resumes are formal documents meant to present your qualifications and experience professionally. Exclamation marks can make your resume appear overly casual or enthusiastic in an inappropriate context. And so, it’s better to avoid them (regardless of how excited you are about your graduation in 2005).\nDon’t negotiate money in your resume. Also, having a resume section called \"Hopes\" is pretty unconventional.\n8. Superhuman's Resume\n\nOkay. Now, the hiring managers across the country (perhaps across the globe) know that you \"lost your virginity\" in 2017, almost got \"tricked into marriage\" while working for Northern Capital Insurance, and \"experimented with softcore drugs\" in 2010 (probably related to the company’s bankruptcy).\nBut it doesn’t really matter because you are \"the best in the world\" in twelve disciplines (including chivalry). It's really an uneasy fate, as one can surely struggle to find the perfect job fit.\nSure. Confidence is an asset, but when it gets this far, it starts to run counter to one's job-seeking efforts.\nThe lesson\nStay modest, use a lot of common sense — and not too many bullet points. Exaggerations and overly positive language can raise doubts about your credibility. Employers prefer honest and realistic representations of your qualifications and achievements.\nNever share highly personal information. Don't try to pepper your career documents with details from your sexual life or experience with substances of various kinds. Your resume will be much better off without them.\nList your work experience in a reverse chronological order. It immediately presents your most recent and, often, most relevant gigs to potential employers. This helps them quickly assess your current qualifications and career progression.\n9. Burning Resume\n\nYale, Harvard, and Oxford are superb academic institutions. But claiming that that's where you studied without including the details is simply a blatant lie.\nAnd while including general life experience may sound funny, misspelling Pulitzer Prize as \"Puletsur Prize\" is just too embarrassing.\nIt's unfortunate that your references \"were burned up in a fire\". Hiring managers might have questions (or maybe not).\nThe lesson\nDetails matter. Specify your experience and academic path and dispel any doubts that you've just made it up.\nIf you have no references, don't mention it. Simple as that. Employers typically request references during later stages of the hiring process, after interviews or when they're seriously considering you for the position. So, even if you have them, including them prematurely on your resume might lead to unnecessary inquiries.\nIf you're stating your interests, make sure they're relevant and convey your soft skills effectively. Also, \"not drinking\" isn't an interest.\n10. Clumsy Hands Resume\n\nYou surely don't want your resume to lack clarity. So, whatever \"good with hands\" means, just don’t use this among your skills (or in any other resume section). Likewise, \"heaps of trophies from heaps of sports\" sounds like nothing but unfounded bragging.\nThis suggests that the job seeker isn't that good with words as they're with their hands. And another supporting example can be found in misspelling the words like \"PlayStation\" and \"references\".\nThe lesson\nStay humble but confident. Let the results speak for you.\nUse clear and formal language. It demonstrates professionalism and respect for the hiring process.\nSelect relevant hard and soft skills to showcase your qualifications, making it easy for employers to identify your strengths and expertise quickly.\nBe specific when talking about your achievements. Specific achievements show potential employers the tangible impact you've had in previous roles. They want to know how your work positively influenced your past employers.\nUse numbers wherever possible. Numbers provide concrete evidence of your achievements and contributions in previous roles. They make your accomplishments more convincing and impactful.\nKey lessons from the worst resumes\nThese 10 worst resumes have provided us with some epic facepalm moments and a healthy dose of laughter too. While they serve as a reminder of what not to do when crafting your own resume, they also teach us a valuable lesson — in the world of job hunting, a little common sense and a dash of humility can go a long way.\nRemember, your resume is a key tool in your job search. So, avoid the pitfalls of \"My Little Pony\" design, oversharing details from your personal life, or claiming to be the world's greatest viral marketer.\nKeep it clear, concise, and relevant, and you'll be well on your way to landing that dream job.

It's an HR computer software programmed to streamline the recruitment process.\nBack in the olden days, you had to hand in a printed resume for a job, and the HR department sorted them by hand. But with the internet and lots of job websites, this way of doing things became outdated and inefficient. \nToday, answering a job advertisement is easier than ever. A single job posting can attract the attention of hundreds of candidates at a time. How could the recruiters possibly deal with all that? Enter the ATS. \nApplicant Tracking Systems help the recruiters in several ways:\nSubmitting a job posting. Hiring managers use ATS to post job listings to multiple job boards and social media platforms from a single source. \nCollecting applications. Candidates apply for jobs through the ATS. All submissions are then collected and oragnized automatically.\nScanning resumes. ATS scans all the submitted applications. It analyses and categorizes the information in resumes (this process is called parsing). It then stores the extracted data and makes it easier to retrieve.\nRanking of candidates. ATS algorithms assign the candidates a percentage score based on how well their data match the criteria set by the recruiters (desired skills, education, past work experience, etc.,). The more your resume matches the job requirements listed in the job posting, the higher your percentage score will be. \nFiltering candidates. Only the job applications of candidates who scored the highest will be forwarded to the recruiters for further review (eg. candidates who scored in the 100% - 75% range). ATS will mercilessly discard all the other applications and resumes. To avoid this, make sure your resume is ATS friendly.\nKeyword optimization: What is it?\nWhen ATS scans your resume, it looks for relevant information in the form of keywords. These represent the necessary requirements (qualifications and skills) for the role. \nThe use of relevant keywords is crucial because it helps the ATS determine the suitability of a candidate for a job opening. The more relevant keywords you incorporate into your resume; the better score you'll get.\nPretty much any information on your resume can be converted into keywords:\nEducation (B.A. in Marketing, M.A. in Software Engineering, …)\nWork experience (customer service, business development, account management, …)\nSoft skills (leadership, communication, critical thinking, …)\nComputer skills (Adobe Photoshop, Python, Oracle, …)\nCertifications (CPE, driver's license, …)\nHow to write down keywords?\nRemember, ATS are computer programmes. It doesn't matter how complex they get; they can only read information if it's in the correct form. That's why you always need to pay attention to your wording.\nBeware of these two common traps:\nUse the exact language as the job posting. This is the alpha and omega of ATS friendly resumes. Not all systems are sophisticated enough to recognize synonyms. If the job posting calls for the knowledge of “Adobe Creative Suite” (which is now discontinued), don't put “Adobe Creative Cloud” among your skills instead. Even though the two packages are identical, ATS might not know that.\nUse both the acronyms and full names of skills, certificates, competencies. Again, some ATS systems might know the term “business-to-business marketing,” but others might be programmed to recognize the same skill only under its acronym – B2B. The safest way is to use both – the full name followed by its acronym. Eg.: Customer Relationship Manager (CRM).\nYour resume should always be typo free. But when it comes to ATS, spelling mistakes are especially costly. Proofread your resume multiple times to avoid any unnecessary mistakes. \nWhere to place the keywords?\nIdeally, the most important keywords will appear 2-3 times throughout your resume. \nAs to their placement, don't get any bright ideas!\nDon't forget, your resume will eventually be read by recruiters. If you try to “cheat the system” in some way, they won't be impressed. \nInventing a section titled “Keywords” on your resume and stacking it with keywords could, in theory, get you through the ATS. But not much further. \nAnd no cheeky white text either! This might've worked when you needed to reach a certain word count on your uni essay – but it won't work now. ATS enables recruiters to see ALL the textual content of your resume, even the one you can't see. This faux pas will cost you a job opportunity. \nKeywords should be sprinkled naturally throughout your resume. Incorporate them into all resume sections: \nresume summary, \neducation, \nwork experience, \nskills, \ncertificates, \nvolunteering, \nawards and achievements. \nWhat is an ATS friendly resume?\nIn a nutshell, ATS friendly resume is a resume which can get past the ATS and make its way to the hands of the recruiters. Using a simple and clean resume layout, avoiding certain graphic elements, and incorporating relevant keywords from the job posting can all contribute to making your resume more compatible with the ATS.\nStill wondering “How to check if my resume is ATS friendly”? Let's have a look.\nHow to make resume ATS friendly in 7 steps\nThe thing is, there isn't just one type of ATS. Companies such as Taleo, Greenhouse, or Lever are just a few drops in the ATS ocean. \nEach software has unique features and properties, but they all follow the same basic principles. \nStick to our advice and make your resume more ATS friendly with these 9 steps:\nOptimize your resume with keywords.\nTo find out which keywords to use, go over your job posting and highlight the most relevant ones. Always cater to the demands outlined in the job posting. Never lie about your skills or qualifications.\nKeep your resume formatting ATS friendly.\nYour resume must be readable by the ATS. To ensure this, avoid using these graphic elements: photos, unusual fonts, alternative section titles, graphs, two-column structures.\nDon't place your personal information in the resume header.\nThe ATS used by the company you want to get hired by may not be able to read information embedded in the header.\nInclude the title of the position you're applying for in your resume summary.\nThis will make the parsing process easier for the Applicant Tracking System.\nIncorporate keywords into your work experience section.\nThis is the core of your resume. When writing down your work experience entries, make sure to use keywords in the exact form they appear in the job posting. Pay attention to how you format your dates.\nExpand your keyword count in the skills section.\nThis is the only section where column structures are allowed. Don't use infographics to mark down the level of proficiency of your skills.\nSave your resume in the right format.\nNearly all ATS programmes can read non-image PDF and .doc files. Always follow the instructions in your job posting though!\nNow, let's look at these steps closely.\nStep 1: Optimize your resume with keywords\nFirstly, you must figure out which keywords to use and where to find them.\nThis step is pretty simple, really: \nGo back to the job posting.\nPrint it out.\nTake a highlighter and mark all phrases that catch your attention.\nFocus on role description, requirements, and responsibilities. \nHere, we've prepared a made-up job posting and highlighted the keywords:\n\nNow, organize the highlighted keywords into groups based on where in your resume you want to place them. This will help you with further steps.\nStep 2: Keep your resume formatting ATS friendly\nMore sophisticated ATS programmes may be able to read creative designs, but this is not a given. And you don't know which software the company you want to get hired by uses. \nCreative designs and unusual layouts can confuse the ATS. Because of this, the resume can be misread or discarded entirely. \nHere is a list of what to avoid: \nPhotos, graphs, tables, text windows and other graphic elements. Attention-grabbing? Yes! Readable by the ATS? No.\nUnusual fonts. Stick to the basics. Use traditional fonts, such as: Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, or Helvetica. \nAlternative section titles. Good old “Personal Information”, “Resume Summary”, “Work Experience”, etc., will do just fine. \nResume formats other than chronological resume. While skills-based resume's been gaining traction, its unusual section organization may be problematic to read for the ATS.\nTwo column structures. ATS are programmed to read documents from top to bottom, left to right. Two column structures might go unnoticed to them. And you can end up with sentences cut in the middle. \nDon't let unsuitable design be the reason why your resume gets discarded!\nChoosing the right formatting for your resume can be a real headache. Save yourself the pain and use some of our resume templates as your first draft. \nStep 3: Don't place your personal information in the resume header\nPutting your contact information into the resume header is a great way to save precious space … normally.\nHowever, if you want to make your resume ATS friendly, we strongly advise against it. \nNot all ATS programmes are designed to read the information in the header or the footer. \nCreate a separate “Personal Information” section and place all your contact information there.\nLooking for ATS-friendly resume?\nOur resume templates are designed by typographers and approved by recruiters.\nTry resume templates\nStep 4: Include the title of the position you're applying for in your resume summary\nThis will make the ATS parsing process so much easier! The software will now immediately know where to place your application. \nPlus, resume summary is a great place to start sneaking in those keywords! \nRemember our job posting example? If we were to apply for it, the resume summary could look something like this: \n\nStep 5: Incorporate keywords into your work experience section\nThe work experience section is the heart of your resume. Since this is, by far, the most extensive section, it provides plenty of opportunities to include keywords. \nUse this space wisely! \nIf you have two or more work experiences with the same/similar competencies, try to focus on the different outcomes you reached. This will give you a chance to use more diverse keywords. But don't avoid repetitions altogether. Remember, it's good to feature certain keywords 2-3 times per resume. \nJust like with a regular resume, organize your work entries in reverse-chronological order.\nWith ATS friendly resumes, it's crucial to use the correct format for dates. There are two ways you can mark dates of employment in your resume: \nWith names of the months. For example: March/2022.\nWith numerals only. If you choose this format, make sure you always mark the dates with double digits! If you want to write down any of the first 9 months of the year, add a 0 before it.\nYES to 03/2022, NO to 3/2022.\nChoose only one of these formats and use it consistently all throughout your resume. \nOur hypothetical Senior Project Manager could incorporate keywords into his work experience like so: \n\nNote the use of action verbs (led, managed, played a role, …) and quantifiers. Both can make your work experience descriptions more succinct and impactful.\nStep 6: Expand your keyword count in the skills section\nSkills section might be the best place to include keywords without making it look too conspicuous.\nFor better organization, divide your skills into several categories such as: computer skills, language skills, etc.\nThis is also the only section where you don't have to shy away from two (or more) column structures. Since the information in this section is usually presented in the form of a list, you don't have to worry about breaking sentences.\nThere is one burning question though – should you include infographics in your skills section?\nThe answer is: a firm no!\nIt's true that the use of graphic elements can elevate the overall look of a resume; but not all ATS know how to read them. If they get confused, you're risking losing valuable points towards your ATS score.\nOur Senior Project Manager decided to make his skills section simple and straight-to-the-point:\n\nWhile the work experience and skills sections are the best for incorporating keywords, make sure to still scatter some around throughout your whole resume and other resume sections (e.g., Education).\nStep 7: Save your resume in the right format.\nFinally, once you've finished putting together your ATS friendly resume, you must save it in the right format. \nIf you thought that there would be no more pitfalls, you were wrong. Different ATS accept different formats.\nHow to know which format is the correct one?\nYou might find the answer to that in the job posting. But if it doesn't contain this information, just like our mock job posting, the safest way to ensure that your resume is ATS friendly is to save your resume in a non-image-based format:\nAs a PDF. One that is not image-based!\nAs a Word document. .doc or .docx\nATS friendly resume templates\nIf you're nervous about formatting your resume, remove this unnecessary stress from your life and use one of your resume templates. \nHere are our picks of 5 most ATS friendly resume templates in our resume arsenal.

For instance, is “strong work ethic” a skill or a strength? You should know the difference.\n\nSkills are things you learn through effort and experience, like being fluent in Spanish or being good at SEO marketing.\nStrengths are your natural personality traits you acquire over time. These might include the aforementioned “strong work ethic” or “good communications skills.” You probably know them under the label “soft skills.”\nYour skills section should mostly include hard skills. Once you’ve put your hard skills on a resume and did it well, it’s no longer necessary to explicitly mention soft skills.\n\nAfter all, if you show you’re good at programming in C#, it becomes quite obvious your computer skills are excellent.\n\nIn any case, you can mention soft skills if they’re specific to the position.\n\nYou're more than \"flexible\".\nPut the right skills on your resume and stand out.\n\nCreate resume\nStep 1: Identify your skills and decide which of them you want to highlight\nWhen it comes to showcasing your skills on a resume, it’s crucial that you highlight the right ones. This is a crucial part of tailoring your resume to each job position you’re applying for.\n\nMake a list of keywords. Carefully reread the job description and look for skills that are required for the position. This will give you a list of keywords that will help you structure your skills section as well as let your resume pass through Applicant Tracking Software that recruiters use to weed out weak candidates.\nMatch your skills to the position you’re applying for. Now take a look at your own skill set and see where it overlaps with the list you’ve just made. The closer your set of skills matches the skills necessary for the job, the better your chances are for getting the job.\nIf you don’t have a skill that is absolutely essential for performing well at the given job, dig into your past experience. Try to come up with some examples that can demonstrate that you’d be able to perform the skill or acquire it very quickly.\n\nAt the same time, even if you don’t have every skill in the job description, it’s not critical. Simply craft your skills section to best reflect what the job requires.\n\nsecond step\nStep 2: Support each skill on a resume with examples and accomplishments\nEmployers don’t respond well to arbitrary lists of nouns and adjectives without any proof.\n\nLook at it this way: If someone told you about what a fantastic snowboarder he or she is, would you believe it? Probably not, as it sounds very much like bragging.\n\nBut what if they’d also tell you about a snowboarding competition they won or about how they go snowboarding every weekend? As Beyoncé says: “Don’t bore me, show me!”\n\nYou can actually do so in two ways:\n\nProvide a description for each skill with a specific example. For instance, don’t simply say that you have excellent writing skills. Opt for something like “Writing skills: Experience with writing business and funding proposals, pitch documents and advertising copy.”\nOr complement your skills section with examples in other resume sections. If you only want to create a skills list, you can simply support your claims with specific examples in your work experience descriptions, profile, accomplishments, or any other suitable section. For instance, if you claim you have \"customer service skills\", you can support this claim in your work experience description with something like \"Awarded Employee of the Month for increasing customer satisfaction with provided services from 87% to 95% within one year.\"\nskills section examples\nSkills section examples\nThere are many different ways how you can format your skills section. Here are a few examples:\n\nBullet list or keywords\nUse bullet points to list your individual skills or simply include keywords. A simple-yet-effective method. However, be sure to add context for every skill elsewhere in your resume.\n\nskills section keywords\nExpanded bullets or keywords\nExpand your bullet points or keywords with specific accomplishments and examples. This approach is more impactful than only listing the skills.\n\nskills with description\nCategorized\nChoose 3-4 major skill categories to serve as subheadings. This is to structure your skills section into something that will look sleek and organised. For instance, if you happen to speak multiple languages, group them under the subheading “Languages”. You can also use subheadings like \"Hard skills, Soft skills, Key skills, Tools and software.\"\n\nskills section categories\nWith proficiency levels\nShow how advanced your abilities are using proficiency levels. This works if you opt for bullet points or categorized skills section.\n\nskills with proficiency levels\nThere are actually multiple ways how you can display your skills levels. More on that in the following section.\n\nHow to display skill levels on your resume?\nWant to up your skills section game? There are various ways how you can display skills levels on your resume effectively when using our Kickresume online builder:\n\n1. Graphs\nConveying certain skills through a visually attractive graph can be a great way to make both your resume and skills stand out. \n\n\n2. Progress bars\nYour main skills can be quickly highlighted using progress bars ranging from novice to expert. This is particularly useful for programming languages, softwares, tools, and other skills where time is required for mastery.\n\n\n3. Word rating\nThis option is better if you want to display your skills in a clean and simple way, plus if you want your resume to be ATS-friendly. It's especially suitable for displaying your language skills. You can use word rating such as native, professional, limited, elementary, etc.\n\n\nWhen should you emphasise your skills on a resume instead of experience?\nIf you’ve ever written a resume in your life, you’re probably quite familiar with the chronological resume style. Although this format fits the needs of most people, there are cases when using it would be ill-advised.\n\nAre you a fresh graduate with no experience to speak of? A chronological resume will make your lack of experience jarring — without letting you showcase the useful abilities you might already have.\nAre you trying to switch careers? A chronological resume won’t let you out of the box of your previous professional experiences. At the same time, it won’t give yo space to highlight your transferrable skills.\nMultiple roles at a single company? A chronological resume wouldn’t make justice to the diversity of skills you’ve acquired.\nDo you rely heavily on your portfolio? A chronological resume would probably end up looking like a complete mess, as your professional history is probably not structured around stable jobs.\nIs there a gap in your employment? A chronological resume will bring attention to this fact instead of emphasising the wealth of skills you had acquired before.\nIn all of these cases, experts recommend using a functional resume instead, as it emphasises your skills and abilities over a chronological career progression. It highlights what you can offer to a company, regardless of your career history.\n\nThe main drawback of a functional resume is that some recruiters will automatically assume that you’re hiding something by choosing to use this resume format.\n\nIn the end, however, it all comes down to how effective it is at convincing potential employers that you really have the skills necessary for getting the job done.\n\nMastered the quick guide on listing skills on your resume? Time to put that knowledge to good use. Visit our library of resume samples and create a resume that effectively showcases your unique abilities.\n\n\nSkills pay the bills.\nCreate a strong resume and get that job.\n\nCreate resume","Meta Description":"Learn how to A Quick Two-Step Guide to List Your Skills on a Resume (+ Examples) and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

How?\nWell, adjectives determine the tone of your resume and help breathe life into otherwise dull descriptions. Which means they come in particularly handy when writing a resume.\nWhether you're crafting your first resume or you're an experienced professional updating your CV, these adjectives can completely transform your story, highlighting your passion, commitment, and exceptional skills.\nWe'll show you a complete list of adjectives for a resume, plus how you can use adjectives on your resume.\n(And if you're asking how we've come up with these words, it's easy. We went through our database of real resume examples by people who got hired at the world's top companies.)\nWithout further ado, here's the list of 200 powerful resume adjectives:\n200 most powerful adjectives to use on a resume\n\nNow that you've seen the complete list of resume adjectives, you may wonder how to actually add them to your resume.\nHow to use adjectives on a resume\nIncorporating adjectives into a resume is nothing complicated. Essentially, you can sprinkle them all throughout the CV. Though remember, it's not about cramming them into every sentence.\nRather, you should strategically place them in these sections that are particularly suited for it:\nResume summary. This is the only part of your resume where you can write a coherent piece of text that gives an in-depth view of who you are as a professional. By using powerful adjectives can turn your resume summary from generic to compelling, encouraging the hiring manager to read on. Here's an example:\n“Certified SEO expert, specialized in driving high-ranked website placements through focused keyword analysis and strategic search optimization. This methodical approach recently led to a 50% increase in organic website traffic for an upscale client. Adept at staying ahead of the curve with trending and up-to-date SEO practices, I am a determined to consistently deliver powerful results in this ever-evolving landscape”\nWork experience. When highlighting your responsibilities and achievements, adjectives can bring more color to your bullet points. For instance, consider the following bullet points for a role in marketing:\nLed and executed strategic campaign initiatives with a results-driven approach.\nFostered collaborative relationships with key stakeholders ensuring smooth campaign delivery.\nImplemented a compelling marketing campaign, which drove a remarkable 25% increase in sales.\nSkills. Here, adjectives serve as amplifiers to your abilities. They enable you to go beyond merely stating \"good communication skills\" to something like:\n“exceptional verbal and written communication skills.”\nRemember, too few adjectives may make your resume seem dull and unexciting, while too many can make it appear overblown or insincere. \nAnd while adjectives are a great tool to make your resume more compelling, adding powerful action verbs will make the CV even more irresistible. \nFinally, consider getting rid of meaningless buzz phrases which only make your resume and cover letter seem generic.","URL Slug":"200-most-powerful-adjectives:-use-these-on-your-re","Meta Description":"Learn how to 200 Most Powerful Adjectives: Use These on Your Resume (Infographic) and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

To help you stand out from the competition, we've compiled a list of the 100 hottest skills to include on your resume. \nWhile the “Skills” section may seem like an easy one to tackle, many people still sabotage themselves by listing cliché buzzwords like “hard-working” or “flexible.” \nHowever, these empty words not only waste precious space on your resume, but they also don't say much about you as a professional.\nInstead, you should include specific skills that are also desired keywords. \nWe'll show you which skills are currently the most in demand in industries such as: \nTech \nHealthcare \nHospitality \nMarketing \nFinance\nand more.\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nWhat types of skills do we recognize?\nWhy are skills on your resume so crucial?\n100 skills to include on your resume in 2024\nWhat types of skills do we recognize?\nFirst things first. What skills should you put on your resume? \nGenerally speaking, there are two recognized types of skills: \nSoft skills. You're usually born with these, but they can also be trained, learned, or perfected. Soft skills on your resume can be: body language, multitasking, time management, persuasion,  stress resistance. However, they must be really relevant to your role. Otherwise, they may appear as buzzwords.\nHard skills. These are the skills that are learned the hard way. They're also measurable. These can be: Java, Spanish, UX, SEO tools, DevOps, Microsoft.\nGenerally speaking, hard skills are essential when applying for technical roles, while soft skills are a must for customer-facing roles or roles that require a lot of teamwork.\nMany think being really good at technical stuff is all that matters. But what they don't realize is that soft skills are just as important these days. And employers along with studies prove so too.\nIn fact, A Harvard University study indicated that up to 80% of a person's career success is influenced by soft skills, while only 20% is influenced by hard skills.\nWith that in mind, let's have a look at the top 10 soft skills employers simply can't resist in an infographic below, according to a recent survey.\n\nYou will find more infographics at Kickresume Blog\nHowever, a balanced resume should include a mix of both soft skills and hard skills. \nNo writing skills?\nNo problem. Just use AI resume writer to generate the first draft of your resume.\nUse AI resume writer\nWhy are skills on your resume so crucial?\nToday, most companies use the ATS system to filter through the large number of resumes that they receive. \nAnd in order to pass the test, your resume simply has to include the right words. Otherwise, even if you're the perfect candidate in theory, you won't make it past the clever technology. \nSo, which skills should you include on your resume in 2024?\nInclude those skills that are required for the position in the job listing. This is the safest way of pleasing both the ATS system and the recruiter. \nThen identify and add specific skills that you possess that are truly your forte and that make you unique.\nChoose industry-specific skills. Different industries require different sets of skills. While your slick negotiation skills may be worth their weight in gold in finance and sales, they may be irrelevant in the design industry. That's why you shouldn't keep sending the same resume for different job openings, and you should always tailor your resume to each job opening. \nChoose skills that are trendy in your industry and favored by hiring managers and recruiting systems this year. To see which are these, scroll to the next chapter.\nInclude a mix of hard and soft skills. This is crucial especially for positions like project management, where effective leadership requires both technical expertise and strong interpersonal abilities.\n\nPro tip: Always support the claim of possessing a certain skill in another part of the resume. For instance, if you claim that you know SEO analytics, include the course that taught you this skill in the “Education” or “Courses” section.\n100 skills to include on your resume in 2024\nFind your industry and see what skills are most desired by employers this year. \n\nNow that you know what hot skills to include on your resume, check out this guide on how to list these hot skills in your “Skills section.” \nThis article was recently updated.

If you're thinking about using one too, we've put together this selection of more than 40 creative resume templates made by successful professionals.\nThese creative resume templates range from quite minimalistic resumes you could use in a wider variety of professions, to some of the most extravagant pieces, suitable for artists or designers. \nSome of these examples are also available as resume templates that you can use (many of them even for free). \nHowever, others are closely tied to the designer's own personality and it probably wouldn't be possible to copy them even if you wanted to. Still, you can use them as inspiration. \nEither way, if you decide to go for a creative resume template, remember that it reflects not only your own personality but also the character of your desired work environment.\nIn other words — you wouldn't want to apply for an accountant job with any of these resumes.

But if you’re applying for a relatively formal and non-creative job in fields like finance, consulting, law, academia, or healthcare, make sure you opt for a minimalistic resume design.

Google: Team Leader Resume Example\nFirst, the length of this resume is fairly impressive. But hey, it’s no fluff — only relevant work experience. However, it might surprise you that older jobs are lacking a description. Why is that?\nIf you have a long story to tell, remember to focus on the 3-4 most recent jobs you had. Likely, hiring managers won’t be very keen on reading an extensive chronicle of your whole professional life.\nAlso, there’s simply no better way of demonstrating your achievements than with numbers.

It includes the most important pieces of information in just four sentences. Nothing unnecessary or non-relevant.\nThe comprehensive summary helps you prioritize information you want the hiring manager to see first. This is ideal for someone looking for high-paying marketing jobs.

In the work experience descriptions, Meghan focuses on job duties and also lists key achievements — context plus impact.\nStill, this resume could benefit from a clearer structure. Although it’s divided into several resume sections, its structure within these sections leaves much to be desired. Remember that nobody likes reading walls of text.

Then, just watch your experience grow with every internship you get.\nMarketing Management Intern at Philips\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n7. Planetromeo: Social Media Officer Resume Example\nMarketing is tied closely with the company’s philosophy and its objectives. Consequently, it’s the social media officer who is responsible for shaping the voice of the company in the online world.\nThe introductory paragraph of Joseph’s resume conveys a clear message: “I share your values and vision, and we will work towards a common goal.” Don’t shy away from including details from your personal life if it has something to do with the position you’re applying to. After all, it’s stories we live, not dry facts.\nSocial Media Officer at Planetromeo\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n8. Hyatt-Regency: Marketing Communications Manager Resume Sample\nSee how the clean layout and logical structure makes the resume easy to read.

L'Oréal: Marketing Manager Resume Example\nBeing able to present yourself is one of the key skills the hiring managers seek. If they can see that you have a knack for the art of presentation, they’ll instantly recognise your potential.\nMarketing is all about customers’ eyes. The bullet points introduce key responsibilities in short phrases and give the resume sample a powerful visual element. One may argue the icons for the job seeker’s hobbies are redundant, but they'll for sure catch the reader’s attention.\nAnother thing that makes this marketing resume great is mentioning notable clients such as Kinder Chocolate. And, of course, including relevant marketing certifications.\nMarketing Manager at L'Oréal\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n10. Hard Rock Cafe: Copywriter Resume Example\nThe position of copywriter at Hard Rock Cafe asks for something eccentric, and that’s exactly what this marketing CV stands for. It’s bold and creative, uses bright colors and an unusual font type. \nUnless you step into the realm of Comic Sans, there’s a high chance you can pick an original typeface that the hiring manager will appreciate. Use it for the headlines, but keep the body text clean by using one of the standard fonts like Verdana, Arial or Times New Roman.\nAnother thing that makes this copywriter resume special is mentioning notable sites and publications that Nora wrote for. She even added a link to her copywriting portfolio which is a great way to show off your work.\nLast but not least, one of the smart ways to demonstrate that you are skilled in communication is including your social media accounts too. But don’t forget to clean up your social media presence first!\nCopywriter at Hard Rock Cafe\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n11. American Eagle: Marketing and Brand Manager Resume Example\nAs a brand ambassador manager, you’ll be required to demonstrate that you know how to lead and work with people. So, that's exactly what Bryant did in his marketing resume. In a few bullet points under the work experience section, he describes how he led consumer research and also a multi-functional team to deliver new product developments.\nMoreover, he talks about other notable achievements and backs them up with quantifiable results — not only in the work experience section, but also in education.\nTo make it even more impactful, you could highlight numbers in bold font so they'll immediately catch the attention of hiring managers.\nMarketing and Brand Manager at American Eagle\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n12. Government of Canada: Digital Media Manager Resume Example\nDigital marketers should think about promoting themselves digitally. That's exactly what Ariel did by adding a link to her website at the top of her resume (although we had to anonymize it).\nBut that's not the only thing that makes her digital marketing resume great. For instance, Ariel was on Justin Trudeau’s social media team, being responsible for his official social media accounts. Cool, right?\nWhat’s more, the way she wrote her resume is at least as impressive as her accomplishments. Notice how she always goes straight to the point when describing her past work experiences. You immediately know what her role was and how exactly she contributed to the overall success of her team — because she includes specific data.\nShe also optimized her resume with digital marketing keywords like “social media, content strategy, UX research, Photoshop”. And both recruiters and ATS systems like that.\nDigital Media Manager at Government of Canada\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n13. Harbour Space University: Sales and Marketing CV Example\nGorkem landed an English-speaking job in sales and marketing at a tech hub in Barcelona thanks to his cut-to-the-chase marketing CV. So, if you're a fresh graduate too, your resume should focus mainly on your education and relevant experience.\nJust like Gorkem's marketing resume does. Even though he doesn't have marketing work experience yet, he outlines relevant skills like communication, creativity and teamwork. Even more importantly, he included an award section with quantifiable descriptions.\nWhile these accomplishments are linked to his studies and the results are above average, just by including them, the resume appears more professional and he makes an impression of a hard-working and detail-oriented person. And that's exactly what a fresh-graduate's resume needs.\nAlso, his hobbies section is a breeze of fresh air. Non-generic hobbies like dancing tango and salsa will add a nice touch of personality to your marketing resume.\nFor those considering university-based marketing roles, there are plenty of university marketing jobs listed by The Times Higher Education that can provide insight and opportunities.\nSales and Marketing at Harbour Space University\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n14. ThermoFisher Scientific: Marketing Strategist Resume Sample\nThermoFisher is the world leader in serving science. That said, Kyle knew exactly how to catch their attention.\nHis marketing resume starts with an impressive marketing professional summary where he highlights his job title and experience of working for Fortune 500 companies. He also outlines his expertise in various marketing spheres. \nMoreover, his resume is packed with relevant marketing keywords and action verbs. Words like “developed, implemented, managed, executed, established, created” will make your work experience descriptions sound much more impactful!\nMarketing Strategist at ThermoFisher\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n15. Big Cartel: Digital Marketing Resume Sample\nMegi's digital marketing resume is rather short, but 1-2 pages is the ideal length for your marketing resume, especially if you don't have more than 10 years of work experience.\nIt has a clean structure and enough white space. But even though the resume template is rather simple, Megi still manages to make her marketing resume stand out by using various graphic elements — like mixing two colors, using bullet points, or displaying skill levels with progress bars.\nHowever, when listing her work experiences, she doesn't use a chronological resume format. If you're an experienced professional, we'd recommend to list your work experience chronologically and start with the most recent job. It's the most used resume format and a favorite among recruiters, too.\nDigital Marketing at Big Cartel\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n16. Streamworks: Media Specialist Intern Resume Example\nThis marketing resume example cleverly highlights what the student candidate has to offer, making the most of limited work experience. \nThe projects section is a genius idea. It's a strategic way of demonstrating applied skills and knowledge which makes up for the lack of professional experience. Each project showcases Roman's hands-on engagement in the field of marketing — from branding and digital analytics, to even creating a campaign proposal. \nRoman also highlights a broad list of relevant skills such as Adobe software, public speaking, and Google Analytics. He's savvy with tech skills, making him a catch for employers, even as a student.\nMedia Specialist Intern at Streamworks\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n17. Adidas: Sales Representative Resume Example\nThis Adidas sales rep resume stands out due to its detailed work experience and an impressive list of extra courses.\nIn the work experience section, the use of bullet points is spot-on. Each responsibility is neatly summed up, showing his diverse roles. From sales to marketing strategies to market research, it's clear Nick has had a progressive career. It’s like we're watching him grow and evolve professionally.\nAdditionally, the extra courses section reinforces this growth narrative.

The IT skills, meanwhile, underline Mary's hard skills. Additionally, the proficiency level is shown for each skill, which is very handy.\nWhat's also impressive is Mary’s achievements section. By quantifying her accomplishments, Mary provides concrete evidence of her capabilities, showing her actions led to significant improvements (“...reducing instances of online out of stock by 40%”).\nE-commerce Operations Manager at IKEA\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n19.

It makes it easier for recruiters to understand his areas of expertise. \nDigital Marketer at WIND Hellas\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n20.

These field-relevant certifications boost Antonella's credibility in the sector. \nAdditionally, Antonella includes a unique Leadership Experience section. Here, roles like General Secretary, Graduate Assistant, and volunteering experiences are smartly highlighted, giving her an edge by showcasing her leadership capabilities and community service.\nBrand Marketing Manager at Merck\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nWant more inspiration?

You’re not alone! Most jobseekers hate writing them. What’s more, most people can’t write them well.\n\nUnfortunately, no article can teach you how to write an excellent cover letter. That takes time, lots of writing practice and a little bit of alchemy. Still, an article can help you avoid some of the worst mistakes.\n\nLike this article about terrible cover letter phrases you should never use in your own cover letter. Let’s have a look at 13 terrible phrases people put on their cover letters and see how you can avoid using their pitfalls in yours.\n\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n\n1. Say hello to your recruiter\n2. Don't think aloud\n3. Job search is no charity\n4. Never state the obvious\n5. Be creative and build suspense\n6. Promote your expertise\n7. Cut the fluff\n8. Make your adjectives paint a colorful picture\n9. Express genuine humility\n10. Spice it up with verbs\n11. Don't think inside the box\n12. Introduce your current employer\n13. Keywords to their hearts\n\n\n\n1. Say hello to your recruiter\nUsing a vague greeting like 'To whom it may concern' is not the best way to start a cover letter. Imagine you get heaps of letters but none of the job candidates knows your name. Look up the person who will be reading your cover letter and address them by their name. It's definitely worth the effort.\n\n\n2. Don't think aloud\nGenerally, avoid verbs of thinking. Don't use words you don't need to, phrases like  'I think I’d be a great fit' make your sentences sound weak. It is clear you are expressing your opinions, so you'd better keep a wary eye on verbs such as think, guess, assume, or believe.\n\ncover letter\n3. Job search is no charity\nIncluding the phrase 'This job would help me because...' in your cover letter might very well put the final nail in your job search coffin. Honestly, who cares about what would help you? Recruiters want to hear exactly the opposite—how you can help the company.\n\n4. Never state the obvious\nStating the obvious in your cover letter wastes time of someone who doesn't have it. 'As you can see on my resume…'  is one of the most redundant phrases widely used in cover letters. Make sure your text flows from one idea to another. Your cover letter should take the reader on an exciting journey, not tell them what they already know.\n\n5. Be creative and build suspense\nRecruiters are flooded with cover letters. They've seen the phrase 'I’m the best candidate because…' over a bajillion times. So this is the perfect occasion to season your cover letter with a pinch of creativity.\n\nHook your reader by saying 'I do have some skills that are hard to come by'. Intrigue the recruiters so that they'll want to read on. Feel free to deviate from the standard template that everyone else follows.\n\ncover letter phrases\n6. Promote your expertise\nDon’t sell yourself short. Be confident and mention any specific experience that will make you an ideal candidate for the position. Start by saying 'Given my extensive experience as…' and make your distinctive skills come into light.\n\n7. Cut the fluff\nAvoid using catchphrases like goal-oriented, hard-working or fast-paced. Let your experience and references speak for you. Employers will be more impressed to hear you talk about your passion for the field and dedication to the people or team with whom you worked.\n\n8. Make your adjectives paint a colorful picture\nUsing flavorless adjectives such as good or nice will make you sound average. You definitely don't want to sink into mediocrity. Don't use language that downplays your abilities and opt for powerful adjectives with added value like attentive, competent, mature, or vigorous.\n\ncover letter phrases\n9. Express genuine humility\nAvoid using always, everybody, never and other extremes. It's just gloating over your own skills. Keep your feet on the ground. Staying reasonable when describing your abilities pays off, it is better to display modesty than some unduly braggadociousness.\n\n10. Spice it up with verbs\nAvoid using weak verbs like make or do. Don't be vague when you can be specific. Here's just a selection of few action verbs for inspiration: accelerated, coordinated, facilitated, initiated, mastered, launched, proposed, reviewed, supervised. Check this infographic for a more complete list.\n\nUse descriptive words whenever you can. Rather than just stating a list of duties, include action keywords in your position descriptions - e.g. proficient in Adobe Illustrator, specialised in social media marketing.\n\n11. Don't think inside the box\nScan, scan, scan for clichés. Phrases like fast learner, go-getter, team player, dynamic leader, or thinking outside the box will make any recruiter roll their eyes. Think about how you can rephrase them to make them more specific, meaningful, personal, and also targeted to the specific job ad and its requirements.\n\ncover letter phrases\n12. Introduce your current employer\nMake sure to slip in the fact that you are currently employed, if that is the case. Employment shows that a candidate is valued by someone else, and that they are looking for a new job to advance their careers, not of out of desperation.\n\n13. Keywords to their hearts\nTake your time and search for keywords specific to your occupation. They help to make your resume selected by hiring managers who screen documents.\n\nKeywords are used to match an applicant with an available job. If the keywords in a cover letter match the job description, the candidate's chances of being selected for a job interview are much higher.\n\nAvoiding the terrible cover letter phrases is only the beginning.\nHopefully, these 13 tips helped you see your old familiar cover letter in a new light. Now you can recognise the awkwardness of pat phrases and unlock the potential of informed word choices.\n\nIf this still sounds a bit far-fetched, check our cover letter examples from real jobseekers who got hired at prestigious companies. Knocking a cover letter into shape isn’t the easiest task—but getting the job you want makes it all worth it!\n\nCut the clichés and kick those terrible phrases to the curb with our advice. Now, let's make your cover letter top-notch and irresistible. Check out our library of cover letter samples and you'll surely find ones that make hiring managers sit up and take note.","URL Slug":"13-terrible-cover-letter-phrases-and-how-you-can-f","Meta Description":"Learn how to 13 Terrible Cover Letter Phrases and How You Can Fix Them and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

NYU: Associate Director Resume Sample\nNotice the length of this resume. Although a resume should rarely exceed two pages (or one page in length if you're at the start of your career), “Boby Eduram” was right to make his resume three pages long. \nThat's because when applying for a job in academia, especially a career at NYU, you're expected to provide an exhaustive account of your previous professional experiences.

Additionally, a resume template comes with specific design elements. Thus, a resume template will determine the look of your resume. \nOn the other hand, a resume format is a WAY in which you order the resume information on a page. \nThere are three main types of resume formats:\nChronological. The most common one. In this resume format, you list the experience and education in strict chronological order. You use this when you want to show how hard you’ve worked towards a goal and how you've progressed over time.\nFunctional. This resume format focuses on your skills and personal achievements and not on chronology. The order is based on importance rather than time. \nA combination of the two types above. \nIf you're not sure which one to choose, see our article about resume formats.","URL Slug":"10+-best-resume-templates-for-2024:-minimalistic,-","Meta Description":"Learn how to 10+ Best Resume Templates for 2024: Minimalistic, Creative & Universal and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

Indeed, in this field, talent and creativity take center stage. But is it possible to convey these qualities on paper, too?\nSurprisingly, the answer is yes.\nThe secret? Slipping in stuff like your biggest awards, references from big names you've worked with, or jobs you've done that really made a difference.\nPlus, a cleverly constructed art resume can point employers in the right direction — to your portfolio where your creativity unfolds. \nWe will show you 12 art resume samples, including 5 sourced from real people who got a job thanks to their standout resumes, as well as 7 that have been expertly tailored to specific art-related roles by our resume specialists. \nHere are the 5 main tips we've uncovered from studying these resumes:\nInclude your portfolio URL in the contact information section of your resume right at the top\nTry an original resume design & playing around with different color schemes or styles  \nAdd (relevant) social media handles, such as Instagram, LinkedIn, or YouTube if you post your work regularly\nDon't forget to highlight relevant hard skills, such as Adobe Photoshop or Final Cut\nInclude references on your resume to boost your credibility\n1. Film Director Resume Sample\nYou can't do better than pitching yourself in the very first section of your resume.\nYour profile summary is your digital handshake. Use it to briefly say who you are, what you do, and what makes you memorable (“knowledge of all stages of the filmmaking process,” “will put in extra hours of work when needed”). \nOutline your career trajectory and convince the recruiter you know where you're heading in a maximum of five sentences. \nSpicing it up with powerful adjectives like performance-driven, deep, excellent, unparalleled will make them want to read the rest of your resume and learn more about your accomplishments and the skills you can offer.\nFilm Director Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n2. Actor Resume Sample\nTalking about an artist's work experience without actually seeing it is absolutely pointless. That's why you should say goodbye to wordy descriptions and focus on including your portfolio.\nAnd how to list your portfolio in a resume? \nThe best way to do so is to include your portfolio URL in the contact information section of your resume right at the top. In the body of the resume, feel free to reference the portfolio to reiterate its importance. \nMoreover, notice how Julienne categorized her previous acting gigs into neat categories and described each role. \nActor Resume Sample\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n3. Graphic Artist Resume Sample\nCreated, established, collaborated, won. Sounds a bit like veni, vidi, vici, right?\nWell, kind of. These words are actually action verbs — verbs that add confidence to your resume. They work so well that 93% of resumes from our database include 1 or more action-oriented phrases.\nUse these action verbs to make your bullet points in the Work Experience section hit the bullseye. Use them to list your job responsibilities and demonstrate your professional abilities. \nBefore finishing your resume, feel free to play around with resume formatting. Ever thought about using bold type, all caps or underlining passages of text? \nFelix did:\nWinning a 2018 GRAPHIC DESIGNER OF THE YEAR AWARD.\nTop 5% of the Program\nThese tools can help you highlight the details that deserve recruiters' attention, such as special awards or notable accomplishments.\nGraphic Artist Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n4. Video Production Assistant Resume Sample\nApplicant Tracking Software has been screening our resumes and deciding our jobs for more than a decade. They can either decide whether to pass your resume on to the hiring manager or throw it away. \nTo be able to make the cut, pack your resume with relevant keywords and industry lingo that these machines will recognize. \nThe more you tailor your vocabulary with the job posting, the better your chances of getting noticed!\nHere are a few examples of the best keywords for a video production role:\nDigital Video & Film Production\nPromo & Trailer Production\nSocial & Digital Production\nScheduling & Planning\nTalent Directing\nScript Writing\nContent Development\nMS Office\nFinal Cut Pro\nAVID Media Composer\nAfter Effects\nAdobe Premiere\nBudgeting\nMotion Graphics\nCrew Management\nFile-Maker Pro\nDisney Video Production Assistant Resume Sample\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n5. Illustrator Resume Sample\nMost resumes look quite boring. Too much text accompanied by a scarcity of visual elements to lighten up the page. No one's impressed, no one's surprised.\nHowever, in the creative industry, you don't need to be afraid to show a more creative design.\nFor example, Anna chose to decorate her resume with doodles adorning its edges, turning her resume into a work of art, too.\nYou can play around with different color schemes, and styles, or icons. You don't even have to keep the traditional one-column layout. \nExperimenting and going beyond what's expected may give you that edge you need to stay ahead of your competition.\nIllustrator Resume Example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n6. Video Editor Resume Sample\nSome roles within the creative industry require people to have certain hard skills. These are technical abilities, such as knowing how to work with certain tools or software. \nFor instance, a video editor like Eba needs to be proficient with tools such as Adobe Premier or After Effects. \nMoreover, while you might possess all the skills listed on your resume, you may want to express your proficiency level.\nSimilarly to languages, you may be proficient in some skills but advanced in others.\nAnd here's where bar graphs and pie charts come in handy. While these visual elements aren't really bulletproof exact, they can help you assess your skills and indicate which ones you've already mastered and which ones you're still working on.\nVideo Editor at Learment Resume Example\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n7. Makeup Artist Resume Sample\nRecruiters want to see a holistic image of the job seeker. Your interpersonal skills are just as important as your professional skills.\nWhile they'll be curious to know your job history and hands-on experience, they'll also want to see the way you communicate and behave in various situations (especially as a makeup artist who will be touching their face!!)\nNonetheless, it's not just about becoming more vulnerable by letting them know what you're really like. \nEmployers are starting to pay attention to workplace happiness as it affects the productivity and creativity of their employees. \nThat's why your soft skills have their rightful place in the Skills section of your resume — they'll help them see how you'd fit in with the company culture and perform in the workplace.\nMakeup Artist Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n8. Guitar Instructor Resume Sample\nThe best way to make your resume stand out from the rest is to quantify your achievements.\nDescribe situations when you helped solve a problem or negotiate a deal and illustrate your accomplishments with numbers, they speak volumes.\nSaying that you helped attract a new client, for example, will just never be as effective as when you add that you grew revenue from $1 million to 5$ million.\nEven our guitar instructor Anna did a great job at quantifying her achievements:\nPromoted services and school all over the Internet - increased client base by 60% within 3 years. \nWorked on the constant improvement of student satisfaction - increased from 85% to 97%.\nGuitar Instructor Resume Example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n9. Photo Editor Resume Sample\nThis example proves you can format your resume whichever way you want, putting emphasis on whatever you deem important.\nWhile the traditional chronological resume format prioritises job seeker's work experience, a functional resume format can help you highlight a completely different section (usually the skills). In this case, the resume focuses on awards.\nThe same goes for the order of jobs in the Work experience section. If you're working a full-time job and freelancing at the same time, it's only up to you to decide which you want to put on display first.\nPhoto Editor Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n10. Junior Creative Resume Sample\nWhen it comes to boosting your credibility, nothing compares to including references on your resume.\nAsk your professors, tutors, and supervisors whom you trust for permission to use their contact information on your resume and willingness to vouch for your skills. \nIf you're not sure how to ask someone to be a reference, simply send them an email with the necessary information.\nThen, include their name, role, and contact information on your resume in a separate references section. Here's how Alan did that:\nShaik Yusuff, Senior Lecturer S.V. Degree College, 999 999 999 \nShaik Cheruddin, Basha Capgemini, (Canada)\nIf you can’t do so now, insert a note saying, “References available upon request.” \nRecruiters will appreciate your willingness to lay your cards on the table and stay honest throughout the process.\nJunior Creative in Advertisement Resume Sample\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n11. Senior Copywriter Resume Sample\nIn the creative industry, it only makes sense that you showcase your creativity. Even through your resume. \nFor a (copy)writer this should be no problem. For instance, rather than just listing his past work experience in a boring way, Martin guides you through his resume in a more engaging, friendly way:\nOne of my pieces got corrected by Elon Musk's PR team, which makes me sort of proud of that really minor inaccuracy! (More of a difference of opinion, really.);\nCo-authored and edited Kickresume's ebook \"The Jobseeker's Guide to the Galaxy\". It wasn't officially recognised by anyone important but it’s beautiful and I take pride in it.\nHe uses informal language, a conversational tone, and shares his personal opinions. Yet, the resume conveys all the necessary information and comes off as professional.  \nPS: That's why we hired Martin.\nSenior Copywriter Resume Sample\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n12. Creative Photographer Resume Sample\nSocial media is a big part of our daily lives. Hence, including your social media on a resume is a great move for people who regularly share their work on these sites. It's basically an extension of your portfolio. \nPlus, your social media can also help people get to know your personality more. Which is a big thing in this industry. People don't just hire a photographer, they hire someone who is on the same wavelength as them. \nLet's look at which social media you should (not) include on your resume:\nAlways: LinkedIn, professional website, portfolio\nDepends: Instagram, YouTube, GitHub, TikTok\nNever: Reddit, Facebook, Snapchat\nAnd how do you include social media on a resume? \nSimply include your social media handle in the contact information section, like Renato did. Alternatively, if you want to include 3+ profiles, you can create a separate social media resume section. \nCreative Photographer Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nStill not enough?

Financial Auditor Resume Example\nWhat is expected of an accountant's resume: the basics\nAs an accountant, what you want to do first and foremost, is to stand out while communicating dependability and attention to detail. For this reason, flashy resume templates are a big no-go in the world of accounting resumes. \nEach of the accountant resume samples below uses a minimalistic template that implies these qualities. \nThe language has to follow the same principle as the design. It needs to be precise, straight to the point, and contain all the important keywords.\nHow you structure the information in your CV is equally important. \nFor this reason, in designing these accountant resume samples we’ve paid most attention to their structure and formatting. Each of the individual sections is divided into bullet points, which facilitates easy reading. You want to do the same. \nBut enough words! Learn what you can from these 10 accountant resume samples!\nNumbers don't lie.\nScan your resume for issues and find out your resume score. Learn how to improve it.\nAnalyze resume\n1. Student Accountant Resume Sample\nThis resume sample exemplifies what an accounting student resume should look like. \nAt this point in your career, you probably don’t have much experience to show. For this reason, the education and skills sections dominate this resume. Each of these two sections is quite extensive in this accountant resume sample and describes in detail what skills did the candidate acquire and how.\nFinally, when you cannot depend on previous experience, related extracurricular activities can help support your candidacy too.\nStudent Accountant Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n2. Accounting Specialist Resume Example\nWhen you’re applying for an accounting specialist position, you need a very strong resume. Once you’ve acquired two or more years of professional experience, the only remaining challenge is to articulate it well on a resume.\nNotice how this resume opens with a professional summary. By doing this, it allows hiring managers to immediately find what they want to see.\nIn this resume sample, we’ve put the education section right after the profile. Although it’s not a big mistake, you might want to consider putting it below your work history section. After all, two years into your career education becomes less relevant.\nAccounting Specialist Resume Example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n3. Entry-level Accountant Resume Sample\nThis graduate accountant resume sample is razor-sharp in its focus. Naturally, education comes first — straight out of college, your degree is still your strongest asset. \nSince this particular candidate did multiple internships during his studies, the rest of the resume simply lists the experience he acquired during that time. And does it in an easy-to-read and structured manner.\nEntry-level Accountant Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n4. Senior Accounting Manager Resume Example\nAs a seasoned professional, you could easily write a resume more packed with relevant information than this one. Despite that, we wanted to show that sometimes it’s equally useful to let your resume breathe a little. \nThis resume doesn’t overwhelm hiring managers with walls of text but makes great use of white space and straight-to-the-point bullet points. Something to keep in mind while writing your own resume. You don’t always need to include every piece of information to make a lasting impression.\nSenior Accounting Manager Resume Example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n5. Senior Accountant Resume Example\nThis accountant resume sample packs a lot of information on a single page. If you’ve ever felt like you can’t possibly make your resume shorter, this sample proves you wrong. \nNote the use of past tense in the first two bullet point sections as compared to the last section’s simple list of responsibilities. The lesson is clear — what you did is always more impressive than what you were supposed to do.\nSenior Accountant Resume Example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n6. Mid-Level Accountant Resume Example\nThis accountant resume sample is designed to do a lot with little. In spite of the candidate’s limited experience, the resume succeeds in making it look more robust than it actually is. \nOne of the reasons behind this is a smart choice of a resume template — it makes the space reserved for text more conflated. Another reason is its use of strong visual elements, such as charts and sliders. It’s a great example of how the content of your resume has to go in hand with its form.\nMid-Level Accountant Resume Example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n7. Tax Accountant Resume Sample\nWhen applying for a job as a CPA tax analyst, you need a very strong resume. The resume below has an air of steadfast responsibility about it. \nThe template design is very formal and doesn’t seek to impress in anything but its minimalism. Similarly, you’d be hard-pressed to find anything irrelevant on this resume. Instead, this accountant resume sample packs an impressive number of keywords to ensure that it gets through any ATS.\nTax Accountant Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n8. Financial Accountant Resume Example\nA pretty standard mid-level accountant resume sample. The opening career summary outlines the candidate’s strongest qualities while remaining concise.\nIf you want to improve on it, structure your summary using bullet points to make it easier to read. Second, notice the use of past tense in each of the subsections. Such use of language has a much greater impact on the reader than a simple list of responsibilities. \nFinally, even if keywords are missing in the main body of the resume, the strengths section makes up for it.\nFinancial Accountant Resume Example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n9. Accounting Manager Resume Sample\nIn many ways, the resume below is a great example of how not to do it. Although it belongs to a candidate who held multiple managerial positions, it hardly ever presents any quantifiable accomplishments. Numbers are impactful and you should never pass on an opportunity to present your experiences by using them.\nOtherwise, this resume sample is clear and well-structured. The use of a two-column template design allows it to pack a lot of information on a single page.\nAccounting Manager Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n10. Senior Accountant Resume Example\nAn accountant resume like the one below impresses with the candidate’s sheer wealth of experience and skills. Remember, it’s all about those first 6 seconds.\nThis accountant resume example catches the recruiters’ attention by making it visually apparent that this candidate’s experience is extensive. The takeaway is clear — once you’ve become a seasoned professional, even a wall of text on your resume doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing.\nSenior Accountant Resume Example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n11. DB Schenker Accountant Resume Example\nThis resume stands out from the crowd. It was provided by one of the Kickresume clients who, also thanks to this resume, managed to land a job at DB Schenker as an accountant. \nIt's easy to see why. Even though Emma used one of the most basic (and free!) templates, when it comes to applying for an accountant job, this isn't a problem. Simplicity is the vibe that you want to go for. Moreover, this resume has the perfect length. It's no longer the rule that a resume should be only a page long.

The resume of this type is welcomed by hiring managers as it is familiar and well-structured  — and therefore easy to read.\nAccounting Auditor Resume Sample\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n13. Financial Auditor Resume Example\nThis template is a little too colorful for an average accountant's resume. However, the overall impression remains professional and highly structured. \nMoreover, this accountant resume sample is the perfect example of how extra sections on your resume can enhance the quality of the whole CV. If you have a volunteering experience or a special certificate, make sure that you always include it.\nFinancial Auditor Resume Example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nFinally, if you feel like you still need more advice, check out our ultimate resume guide.

And that's, after all, the whole point of a resume.\nAccount Officer\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nWas this not enough?

Having this proverbial truth in mind, we’ve decided to help all students save some time reading.\n\nYou can often find nigh universal truths in Beyoncé’s songs, one of them being: ”Don't bore me, show me.\" Show, don’t tell. A look is worth a thousand words.\n\nYet, when it comes to most resumes, they’re incredibly boring to read. This might be one of the reasons why recruiters usually only spend about 6 seconds on each resume before they move on to another.\n\nThere’s simply nothing there to immediately catch their attention.\n\nYet, if you want to get hired you need to make them pay attention for a bit longer than that. If you were a seasoned professional, you’d achieve that by simply listing your previous accomplishments and hoping they’re impressive enough.\n\nAs a student, however, you need to be a bit more creative than that.\n\nFortunately, there are still many tools at your disposal you can use to stand out too.\n\nWhen you take a look at the resume samples below, you’ll notice how each of them succeeds in articulating even seemingly unimpressive work experiences.

For this reason, the exhaustive education section dominates our biomedicine student resume sample. This candidate did no internships to support his candidacy, which is why he decided to list even unrelated work experience. If you were not fortunate enough to work in a job related to your field yet, don't be afraid to do that too.

You may be a killer writer, and great at expressing yourself in words, but when it comes to grammar, it's a totally different ballgame.\n\nBut, when an employer picks out grammar mistakes in your resume, it can drop your credibility like a rock – especially if you've touted yourself as a perfectionist, who's meticulous attention to detail is like no other.\n\nGet rid of those grammatical errors, and present your best self with a pristine, grammatically perfect resume.\n\nAn online proofreader, like 1Checker, can help you avoid those potentially embarrassing mistakes that could cost you the opportunity of landing that job.\n\nIt's both a spelling and grammar checker that keeps your writing natural sounding, letting you make a great first impression.\n\nSpellcheck cannot be trusted.\nThere are some benefits to using an automated spell checker, and they'll catch the very obvious mistakes. But, there are things that a computer just can't catch.\n\nSomething could very well be spelled properly, but in the context you've used it, is totally wrong. “You're” and “your are” both spelled right, but depending on what you're trying to say, you could be using the incorrect word.\n\nRunning your resume through a spell checker is a good start, but it's always beneficial to have someone else read through it also.\n\nExpert proofreaders are a great resource, when you can't trust an automated spell checker, and BoomEssays has a team of professionals ready to help you.\n\nEven if your lingo is job-specific, they won't have any problems, since each proofreader is an experienced pro in their field of work and will know exactly what you're trying to say.\n\nApproach it from a different direction.\nOnce again, reading your resume left to right and top to bottom can leave you missing some mistakes you've made.\n\nOur brain fills in some blanks when we read, so we don't always notice spelling errors, since our smart little brains fix things for us as we go.\n\nTry looking at it from a different direction – namely, backwards. Read everything you've written backwards to quickly find spelling mistakes.\n\nNo, what you're reading isn't going to make much sense, but because it's not going to flow together quickly and easily, your brain forces you to slow down and examine each word.\n\nIt's harder to automatically fill in the blanks, because the sentences aren't linear and sensical.\n\nYou won't be able to spot grammar errors like this, but spelling mistakes will be a lot easier to see.\n\nGet another view of your work using the TypoVision proofreading tool, that displays your text in an unfamiliar way. Doing this, much like reading it backwards, makes it easier to spot those spelling mistakes, because your brain is forced to work in a different way.\n\nTake some time off.\nAs long as you've got the time to spare, it's always a good idea to take a step back, put your resume away for a little while and come back to it later.\n\nWhen you look at something too much, you can start to overlook even the most glaring mistakes, because you've become too familiar with it.\n\nGiving yourself a day, or even a few hours, away from your resume lets you reset your mind. Perhaps what you thought sounded great before, all of a sudden doesn't make much sense.\n\nWhen you're writing, it's easy to let mistakes slip by, because in your head, what you've put together makes perfect sense.\n\nYou can also enlist the help of another set of eyes to make sure everything reads as well as you think it does. EssayRoo can match you with a professional proofreader, who's also got experience in the field of work you're interested in.\n\nThat means they'll be able to tailor the language in your resume to the job, making a lasting impression on the person tasked with reading through the resumes being submitted.\n\nMimic their style.\nCertain things may not matter much to you when you're writing your resume, like putting a comma at the end of your bullet points.\n\nBut, to someone who's reading and assessing your resume, those little things could make a difference.\n\nMimicking the style of the hiring manager will leave a good first impression on them – they may not notice that you're using the same stylistic elements as them, but they'll probably notice if you don't.\n\nCheck out the job posting, and use the same style preferences that you see there, since the hiring manager was likely the person putting together that job posting.\n\nWhen they're reading something that is reflective of what they're used to seeing and writing themselves, it makes for a more comfortable read and they won't be fixated on the things they would have done differently.\n\nGet a real person to read it.\nSometimes it's easier to just copy and paste your text into an automated spelling and grammar checker, and while a computerized tool can catch many errors, it's not likely to catch every single one of them.\n\nThat's where a real, live person can really be an asset. People can read context, where computers just can't. And, while a sentence may be spelled perfectly, when it's read by a person, it may not make sense or be easy to comprehend.\n\nWhen you're reading your own writing, you've come to be familiar with it, and you know what you're meaning to say, so it's so easy to miss things.\n\nSomeone who's laying their eyes on your writing for the first time is better equipped to notice those mistakes, because they don't know what you're trying to say, so if it doesn't make sense, it will stand out to them.\n\nIf you are looking for a real person, who is also an expert in that line of work, to help with your proofreading, check out UK Writings.\n\nTheir proofreading services will pair you up with someone who knows exactly what to look for, and what type of improvements can be made to the language of your resume to make it the most impactful.\n\nHard copy review.\nStaring at a computer screen for too long can cause you to go a little crossed-eyed and start missing even the easiest mistake to spot.\n\nTry printing out your resume to see an actual hard copy that you can review. Not only will you get to look at it away from the computer screen, but you'll also see what it'll look like if an employer decides to print it.\n\nMake sure nothing funky happens, like the margins shifting. Before hitting the print button, get a quick review from Proofread Bot, that can pick out any errors and make additional suggestions for improving your writing.\n\nGet the personal stuff right.\nWe usually just assume that we've typed out our personal information perfectly, since we know it so well. But mistakes can happen, and even the smallest error here could actually cost you the job.\n\nGet one number wrong in your phone number or misspell your email address, and an employer won't be able to contact you, no matter how interested they are.\n\nNarrow your focus.\nTrying to catch every single grammar, spelling and stylistic mistake you've made can be tough if you're trying to do it all at once.\n\nBreak things up by just focusing on one area at a time – read it once for spelling, then again for grammar. It may take a little more time, but you're more likely to catch the mistakes in there if you're specifically looking for one thing.\n\nGet yourself started by turning to Slick Write for some suggestions on how to boost the level of your writing. You can even narrow what it searches for, including commonly confused words and extra spaces.\n\nEnsure that what you're sending out to employers is absolutely perfect and error free. With the help of these techniques and valuable resources, you can put your best foot forward and give yourself the best chance at landing that dream job.\n\nMastered our 10 resume proofreading techniques?

Sound cool. Feel confident.\nAnd, last but not least, leave a lasting impression.\nErm… bunch of things that seem a bit out of your reach, right? \nIt's not really that difficult, though — especially when someone's already done the homework for you.\nAnd there's not just one example we're about to show you. The following 10 real management resume samples will teach you how to read recruiters' minds, bring your resume to perfection and get your career moving in no time.\nHere we go!\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n1.

DHL Sales Support Resume Sample\n10. Sheraton Hotel Marketing Manager Resume Sample\n1. Dell Junior Product Line Manager Resume Sample\nThis is a fine example of a resume that's worth following for college students and recent graduates.\nIt's no secret that top companies are treading college campuses and university buildings to hunt for individuals with extraordinary skills and dedication to their work. \nIf you want these guys to take notice, describe successful school projects and other remarkable achievements that you're proud of. \nTrust us, you can manage.\nCreate a stellar resume with only few clicks.\nCreate resume\nThis may lead you to flooding recruiters with facts, but remember that the length is not everything. Unless you're a seasoned professional with 10+ years of experience, there's no need for a multi-page resume. In fact, it's more of a nuisance rather than an asset.\nSo if you can't seem to squeeze everything you want to a single page, opt for a two-column layout for a better distribution of space on your resume.\nProduct Line Manager at Dell\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n2. Vodafone Release Manager Resume Sample\nThere are several handy tools that can help you present information in your resume in a neat and structured manner. Numbered lists, bullet points, indentation, graphs, charts have the power to boost the readability of your resume.\nBut using full sentences is tricky and the benefits of this system can hardly outweigh its drawbacks.\nRetaining the recruiter's attention is the key to your success. A block of text, compared to a bulleted list, doesn't give action verbs the opportunity to stand out. The resume genre asks for brevity and language connectors — albeit making the sentences more fluent and natural — are simply redundant.\n\nAt HT Micron I started accumulating several functions on sales and product marketing, being responsible to represent both HT Micron and Teikon companies commercially, qualifying both companies to supply to their clients, controlling new product introduction and life cycle management during the first year of HT Micron´s operation. After this first year new salesmen were hired and I switched my focus mainly to product marketing and the companies and products qualifications, where I was needed to analyze customer needs and develop solutions along with the R&D team and our technology partners in Korea and creating reports for product viability and return of investment to present for the companies management. Currently, my role is Customer Quality Specialist, focusing on translating the clients needs to our processes and products, following up on product RMA, overall quality levels, fail analysis and product qualifications.\nRelease Manager at Vodafone\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n3. Samsung Leader of Production Resume Sample\nNo resume is ever complete without job seeker's personal and contact information. \nThe best approach is to put it down in a single line — there will be other sections that will want to eat up a lot of space on your resume.\nInclude your date of birth, nationality, email address, postal address, phone number, personal website and links to your social media profiles like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Behance or Instagram — but only if that's the place recruiters should head to convince themselves that you're a good fit. \nAction verbs are a great way to introduce your bullet points but don't also hesitate to use industry-specific lingo and specific keywords that will resonate with the potential employer. \nDon't be afraid to use technical terms, insider abbreviations and acronyms, mention the software you work with, companies you've worked for and specific projects you've worked on (unless you're still under NDA, of course). \n\nChecks documentation and invoices (NF-e / CT and / NF-d) for all the FTL, LTL, FCL, LCL issued cargos.\nEnsures... all documentation is prepared to meet the requirements of SEFAZ / SUFRAMA.\nAudit security and S.O.P warehouses of all HUB's company and partners.\nOperates SAP/ R3 systems in logistics related modules.\nLeader of Production at Samsung\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n4. Amazon Business Development Manager Resume Sample\nBeing young is not an obstacle. It's just in the way you look at your experience.\nIf you haven't yet amassed any relevant work experience at a regular full-time job, you should definitely turn to describing the courses you took while at college. \nThink about your time at college and focus on the courses that are related to the given job opening. Think of any grades, projects, internships, volunteering opportunities, academic awards, certifications that would highlight your skills.\nCreate numbered or bulleted lists wherever you find appropriate. If you can put down anything in a structured manner, do so.\nThese visual aids facilitate reading and support the internal logic of the text.\n\nI discovered this passion was:\nStandardising final checklist tests and drafting market approaches...\nFollowing the success of a proof of concept exhibiting the possibilities of free communication between SAP applications and selective Social Media...\nMy tasks and responsibilities in this team were:\nDeveloping an OData Service for Sales Document.\nConfiguring the OData Services on various system landscapes in SAP.\nTesting the OData Services developed within the team by other developers.\nBusiness Development Manager at Amazon\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n5. Walmart Store Manager Resume Sample\nThis resume was probably designed with a vision that bullet points will pierce the recruiter's heart. Which is not that far from the truth, actually.\nFirst, it boasts a wide array of action verbs at its finest. Just read them top to bottom and you get instant gist of the bakery manager's job responsibilities:\n\nEnsure...\nCommunicate...\nCompile, copy, sort, file...\nEnter...\nMaintain and update...\nManage...\nOperate…\nVerify...\nResolve… \nUse… enter, access, retrieve… compute...\nSecond, this resume is visually compact, colors are bright but not too striking, the neat two-column layout helps keep everything on one page and everything falls into place very easily. \nPure zen.\nStore Manager at Walmart\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n6. Clarity Software Sales Manager Resume Sample\nInfuse the profile section of your resume with powerful adjectives.\n\nDedicated, hardworking, and charismatic solutions engineer with over 10 years of sales experience. With attention to detail and a knack for demonstrating software, I am looking to further my career.\nReflecting the specifics of your industry, feel free break down your skills into categories such as pre-sales, demonstrations, scoping and languages. \nWhether you're using bar graphs or pie charts, remember to acknowledge the fact that there's still some space for learning. Base the rating of your skills on reality and differentiate those that you've already mastered from those you're still developing.\nSoftware Sales Manager at Clarity\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n7. Microsoft Cloud Program Manager Resume Sample\nSeeing is believing.\nNumbers will attract everyone's attention and add accuracy to your otherwise pretty mundane resume. Go ahead and make your achievements more palpable by introducing numerical expressions wherever possible.\n\nI have managed a team of 20+ consultants with CSAT targets and had successfully lead responses of large RFPs.\n2. Successfully lead responses of multi-million-dollar RFP responses and winning business.\nResponsible for heading Cloud migration factory which migrated more than 1 million mailboxes to the cloud.\nSuccessful in delivering more than 30 projects with 100% CSAT.\nCloud Program Manager at Microsoft\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n8. Unicef Freelance Trainer Resume Sample\nThis resume proves that, at the end of the day, the formatting of a resume is up to your own choosing.\nWhether you go with one of the conventional resume formats or prefer to have your own way when it comes to designing your resume, always think about the top sections as those that will get the most attention.\nThe three simple pie charts in the WHAT I DO? section and the STRENGTHS section packed with relevant keywords — accommodating the widespread use of ATS — are great tools to describe the job seeker's main occupations and illustrate her value to the potential employer.\nThe inclusion of Facebook and LinkedIn social profiles follows a purpose, too. It's a sign of openness and willingness to network one's way to the new job.\nFreelance Trainer at Unicef\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n9. DHL Sales Support Resume Sample\nRemember, having substantial work experience may be the first step towards landing a cool job, but that's not the only way to do so.\nShow that you volunteered for a cause to demonstrate your responsibility for the community and the environment you live in.\nAnd if you're still lacking some professional competencies, think about investing some time into getting an online certificate. It's a very convenient way to work on your skills and increase your market value as an employee. \nGoogle’s Digital Garage, Coursera, Udacity, Khan Academy, Udemy, Shaw Academy or Hubspot provide quality education for just a fraction of the fees you'd pay for a traditional college course.\nSales Support at DHL\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\n10. Sheraton Hotel Marketing Manager Resume Sample\nTo give your resume some extra depth and eye-catching abilities, add something that sets you apart from the average candidate.\nYou want to present yourself as being the best choice for the firm, so any awards or certificates that can nudge recruiters to think just that is a must on your resume.\n\nRegional Award / Best Tactical Marketing Campaign / Hilton Hotels & Resorts MEA (03/2016)                \nHotel Award / Best Hotel Support / Hilton Alexandria Green Plaza (01/2014)\nRegional Award / Best Social Media Engagement / Hilton Hotels & Resorts MEA (03/2013)\nMarketing Manager at Sheraton Hotel\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nImagine having a top-notch CV assembled within seconds, all from your LinkedIn profile.

Okay, maybe not just yet. For now, it seems, they'll content themselves with taking our jobs.\n\nScared? Maybe you don't have to be. Take a look at the Rise of the Robots webpage to find out. Or don't. Ignorance is bliss, after all.\n\nStill, this whole situation seems terribly unfair, especially when you realize that most healthcare employees are going to be totally fine. The thing is, you can't simply program emotions and behaviour into an artificial brain (yet).\n\nBut wait, what if you're a healthcare professional yourself?\n\nGood for you, then! You're going to be more than all right.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the need for qualified health care workers will increase by 19% by 2024. What's more, there are already 18.9 million individuals employed in the healthcare field—four million more than in 2005.\n\nIn spite of that, getting a job in healthcare is not always easy. To help you out with that, we've put together 10 awesome healthcare resume samples.\n\nOh and some of them even belong to real people who already scored a job in healthcare.\n\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n\n1. Physical Therapist at Houston Methodist: Resume Sample\n2. X-Ray Technician at Tarpon Orthopedics: Resume Sample\n3. Clinical Project Manager: CV Sample\n4. Hospice Care Nurse: Resume Example\n5. Dental Assistant: Resume Sample\n6. Cardiac Nurse: Resume Example\n7. Nurse Anesthetist: Resume Example\n8. Dermatologist: Resume Sample\n9. Certified Nurse Midwife: Resume Sample\n10. Dentist: Resume Sample\n\n\n\n1. Physical Therapist at Houston Methodist: Resume Sample\nWhat works: It's packed with relevant keywords, straight-to-the-point bullet points, and easily demonstrable achievements. We're always happy to see that—and hiring managers are too.\n\nHow to improve it: See for yourself how unnecessarily long it is. Come on, just click on it (not a clickbait 😅).\n\nSure, this resume is already good enough. After all, it helped someone score a job as a physical therapist. On the other hand, it would have worked even better if it fitted on a single page.\n\nMake a healthy career choice.\nGet hired fast with a standout resume.\n\nCreate resume\nAlso, the bullet points. Well, they aren't really bullet points, are they? No, every single one of them is the minus.\n\nWhen writing lists, you should always use bullet points or dashes. Also, don't forget to separate the individual items with semicolons. (Or periods if you're feeling a bit cheeky.)\n\nPhysical Therapist at Houston Medical Center\nPhysical Therapist Healthcare Resume Sample\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\n\n\n2. X-Ray Technician at Tarpon Orthopedics: Resume Sample\nWhat works: Contrary to the previous resume, this one fits on a single page. Yay.\n\nAlso, even though it lists the candidate's full employment history, it only elaborates on the most relevant jobs. In this way, it doesn't swamp the potential employer with unnecessary information.\n\nHow to improve it: Yet again, this resume helped someone score a job as an X-ray technician. That alone makes it good enough (Congratuwelldone! 🥳).\n\nStill, you could improve it by removing skills like problem solving, scheduling, or patient care from the list. If you're applying for a job as an X-ray technician, these go without saying.\n\nAt the same time, we'd recommend rearranging the sections a bit. For instance, this particular job seeker can boast a lot of experience in the field. Because of that, we'd recommend putting the work experience section first, then education, and skills last. Your greatest strengths should always come first.\n\nMedical Assistant / X-ray Tech at Tarpon Orthopedics\nX-Ray Technician at Tarpon Orthopedics Resume Sample\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\n3. Clinical Project Manager: CV Sample\nWhat works: Whoa! This one's certainly not afraid to go into great detail. And no, it's not just the one page you can see below.\n\nWith the length of four pages, we even hesitate to call it a resume. But what makes for a terrible resume, can make for an excellent CV. Let's call it a CV then!\n\nWhat's the difference then? A resume is supposed to attract attention to your most relevant and notable accomplishments. A CV, on the other hand, is an exhaustive account of your employment history.\n\nAnd if the document below isn't exhaustive, I don't know what is. 🤨\n\nHow to improve it: Although a CV is supposed to be detailed, this one is probably going a bit too far. Try to read all four pages of it, I dare you!\n\nIn the end, however, it's not the length that makes it difficult to read. It's the formatting.\n\nThe text simply doesn't have enough space to 'breathe'.\n\nAs you can see, you should never underestimate the power of proper padding, line height, margins, and font size.\n\nHaving said that, you should probably also know that this guy did get the job. Who are we to judge, then?\n\nClinical Project Manager\nClinical Project Manager Resume Sample\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\n4. Hospice Care Nurse: Resume Example\nWhat works: The way it looks. And by that, we don't mean the purple something at the top of the page.\n\nNo, how it organizes information has a much bigger impact.\n\nFirst, it makes you remember the resume.\n\nSecond, it makes the text read well. Look at how easily you can follow each section. Thanks to that, the hiring manager, too, will be able to find the most important information fast.\n\nHow to improve it: A dedicated achievements section would certainly help to elevate this one. If these achievements were also expressed in numbers, even better.\n\nAfter all, the best way to impress a hiring manager is to tell them about how you solved a challenging problem in the past.\n\nHospice Care Nurse\nHospice Care Nurse Healthcare Resume Sample\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\n5. Dental Assistant: Resume Sample\nWhat works: Clean, straight-to-the-point and visually pleasing. In healthcare, you probably don't want your resume to look too creative. A minimalist design, such as the one below, is more than enough.\n\nHow to improve it: For the most part, this resume is good. Let's take a look at something really minor then.\n\nThe hobbies section. See that volunteering icon at the very end? If you do volunteer work regularly, then you should almost always put it on your resume. Not enough space? Ditch the hobbies section, for instance. What you actually do is always more interesting than what you like to do.\n\nOh, and one more thing. See that \"Main duties:\" line under the second job? That's completely redundant. Leave it out.\n\nDental Assistant\nDental Assistant Resume Sample\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\n6. Cardiac Nurse: Resume Example\nWhat works: Great profile section. See how it uses bold text to emphasize the years of experience?\n\nThis job seeker also took on a less formal tone of voice. Sure, it's not always a good idea to pour your heart out on a resume. But in this case, it was done with good judgement and shows the job seeker's passion for the job.\n\nHow to improve it: We found it a bit difficult to navigate the individual subsections. For instance, the profile section can be easily divided into multiple bullet points to remedy this. Remember, everybody hates reading a 'wall of text'.\n\nCardiac Nurse\nCardiac Nurse Resume Example\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\n\n\n7. Nurse Anesthetist: Resume Example\nWhat works: The skills section dominates the page. Which is great if you want to emphasize your skills.\n\nWhat's more almost every section is packed with keywords, acronyms, and industry lingo. What's more, in a nurse resume, this works surprisingly well.\n\nHow to improve it: Similarly to the previous resume, this one would also benefit from a more generous use of bullet points. Or more careful formatting in general.\n\nThe skills section, even though it does many things well, could benefit from a more regular placement of words and progress bars.\n\nFinally, although we praised the personal tone of the previous resume, we hesitate to do it with this one.\n\nNurse\nAnesthetist Resume Example\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\n\n\n8. Dermatologist: Resume Sample\nWhat works: Although the work experience section claims to list responsibilities, the fact that it's written in the past tense slightly mitigates it. Remember, you always want to list achievements, not responsibilities. On the other hand, the past tense can make even responsibilities sound a bit more 'accomplished'.\n\nAlso, this resume is visually balanced, which makes it immediately attractive and rememberable.\n\nHow to improve it: Remove the redundant 'Main responsibilities' headlines.\n\nThe hobbies section could be easily removed in favor of a more expansive work experience section.\n\nThe profile section opens in a weird way ('sensitive and patient' sounds a bit peculiar). \n\nDermatologist\nDermatologist Resume Example\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\n\n\n9. Certified Nurse Midwife: Resume Sample\nWhat works: Pretty much the same things that work for the previous resumes. Let's not repeat ourselves.\n\nHow to improve it: Remove the \"Main responsibilities\" headlines and the hobbies section is unnecessarily extensive.\n\nSeveral bullet points inside the experience section are somewhat vague. \"Building productive working relationships with other hospital personnel\"? Although nice, this line adds nothing to your resume. Things like these go without saying.\n\nCertified Nurse Midwife\nCertified Midwife Nurse Resume Sample\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\n\n\n10. Dentist: Resume Sample\nWhat works: Professional minimalist template. Quantified achievements (5,000 patients, 95% dental readiness, etc.).\n\nHow to improve it: Yet again, we're not sure about the hobbies.\n\nAlso, would you go to a dentist who isn't 100% expert at \"Soft Tissue Management\", but excels in teeth extraction? Sounds a bit scary to us.\n\nDentist\nDentist Resume Example\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\n\nUse this sample as your first draft\nPlanning to land a healthcare job that robots can't snatch?

The biggest turn off for an interviewer is to see a resume overflowing with irrelevant information. To make a good first impression you must keep the resume precise and relevant. Trim the information as per the specific role for which you are applying.”\n\n— Vartika Kashyap, ProofHub\n\nResume Advice #2: \"Keep in mind the skills you have to offer an employer”\n“It's important as an entry-level job seeker to keep in mind the skills you have to offer an employer. Don't have much work experience? Think about the skills you accumulated during your studies. What software did you use? What technical skills did you pick up? What languages have you learned to speak? It all matters, but it's even better if you can demonstrate how you used these.”\n\n— Scott Singer, Insider Career Strategies\n\nresume experts\nResume Advice #3: \"Job experience isn't the only experience that counts on your resume”\n\"Don't forget to include any extra curricular activities that relate to your desired field.

Job experience isn't the only experience that counts on your resume.”\n\n— Erin Kennedy, Professional Resume Services, Inc.\n\nResume Advice #4: \"Alter your resume according to your job description”\n“I guess after I made the resume everyone thinks that creative resume is the key to any job. People need to start realizing that the magazine resume worked for me because I wanted to get into that field. People need to start being original and put up their own creativity. It'll take time for you to come up with something but I'm sure it'll be worth it.  Advice — Alter your resume according to your job description. Your homework needs to be on point (knowing the background of the company).”\n\n— Sumukh Mehta, creator of one of the most creative resumes ever (BBC)\n\nResume Advice #5: \"Ask the 'so what' question with each bullet point”\n\"Format wise: The resume needs to be visually appealing. The hiring manager needs to be able to find the most relevant information for the position easily.\n\nContent wise: Results and relevance . . . I instruct my clients to ask the ‘so what’ question with each bullet point. Tell me why this information is relevant for the particular position and identify the results of the actions you took.”\n\n— Amy Wolfgang, Wolfgang Career Coach\n\n\nResume Advice #6: \"Your professional summary should resonate who you are\"\n“The biggest mistake that I often see in a resume is the use of an objective instead of a professional summary. Objectives should not be used in a resume. Your objective is to find a job, but your professional summary should resonate who you are as a professional and the skill sets you have to offer. Think of a professional summary as an introduction to the novel about yourself. It should entice the reader with information that will make him/her want to continue reading on to learn more about you.”\n\n— Wendi Weiner, The Writing Guru\n\nResume Advice #7: \"OWN your experiences proudly!\"\n“I see too many young jobseekers make the mistake of NOT including experience on their resume that is unrelated to their current current goal, thinking it is irrelevant and not of any value. Nothing could be further from the truth! ANY professional experience: summer jobs, part-time work, volunteer work, etc. is experience, and as a result, there are many areas of knowledge skills and strengths you have gained from them that are highly valuable and transferable to many many different industries.  Look at yourself as a 'portfolio' of diverse skills and strengths you can contribute to potential employers. In other words, OWN your experiences proudly!”\n\n— Vicki Aubin, The Rockin' Career Coach\n\n\nResume Advice #8: \"Always write a SHORT intro message stating exactly why you are fit for the role\"\n\"Looking for a new job can be scary, frustrating, exciting, and difficult among other things. This is especially true for fresh grads with minimal experience. Here is my advice:\n\nYour resume is not a laundry list. Tailor your resume to the company and position you apply to. Make it one page and highlight your accomplishments.\nTake your time and apply to the roles and companies that best align with your skills. Don't mass apply to everyone.\nDon't get frustrated. If you don't hear back try and try again.\nNow some special hints and tricks:\n\nAlways write a short intro message or cover letter stating exactly why you are fit for the role and what you love about the company. Remember SHORT!\nFollow up on LinkedIn directly with the manager/recruiter for the role reinforcing the above.\nDon't use the same message for all companies, managers, recruiters, etc. Always make everything personal to the company or individual.”\n— Kristopher Osborne, SmartRecruiters\n\nResume Advice #9: \"Do internships during university and highlight them as best as you can\"\n“If you were wise enough to do an internship/s during university, you should highlight them as best you can. You would place your Education section close to the top, followed by your Experience (internships), which would describe all relevant accomplishments and major responsibilities. Employers are not only interested in your educational success; they're also interested in real-life work experience.”\n\n— Bob McIntosh, Things Career Related\n\nResume Advice #10: \"Give a glimpse of your personality”\n“If you are applying for your first job and want to create a strong CV, it's important to show who you are and give a glimpse of your personality. Employers want to get to know you better, so it's a good idea to write about your hobbies. You can tell them what you like doing in your free time by giving examples from your daily life and referring to your interests. Remember to include your biggest accomplishments if you want to stand out from the crowd.”\n\n— Kyriaki Raouna, CareerAddict\n\nNot a resume expert?\nWorry not!

If you've always felt that the term \"problem-solving skills\" is rather vague and wanted to know more, you've come to the right place.\nIn this article, we're going to explain what problem-solving skills really mean. We'll talk about what makes up good problem-solving skills and give you tips on how to get better at them. You'll also find out how to make your problem-solving abilities look more impressive to those who might want to hire you.\nSounds good, right? Curious to learn more? \nIn this article we’ll show you:\nWhat are problem solving skills;\nWhy are they important; \nSpecific problem solving skills examples;\nHow to develop your problem solving skills;\nAnd, how to showcase them on your resume.\nWhat are problem solving skills?\nFirst of all, they're more than just a buzzword!\nProblem-solving skills are a set of specific abilities that allow you to deal with unexpected situations in the workplace, whether it be job related or team related. \nIt's a complex process that involves several “sub skills” or “sub steps,” namely:\nRecognizing and identifying the issue at hand.\nBreaking the problem down into smaller parts and analyzing how they relate to one another. \nCreating potential solutions to the problem, evaluating them and picking the best one.  \nApplying the chosen solution and assessing its outcome. \nLearning from the whole process to deal with future problems more effectively. \nAs you can see, it's not just about solving problems that are right in front of us, but also about predicting potential issues and being prepared to deal with them before they arise.  \nWhy are problem solving skills important?\nDespite what you may believe, problem-solving skills aren't just for managers. \nThink about it this way: Why do employers hire employees in the first place? To solve problems for them!\nAnd, as we all know, problems don't discriminate. In other words, it doesn't matter whether you're just an intern, an entry-level professional, or a seasoned veteran, you'll constantly face some kind of challenges. And the only difference is in how complex they will get.\nThis is also reflected in the way employers assess suitability of potential job candidates. \nIn fact, research shows that the ability to deal with unexpected complications is prioritized by an overwhelming 60% of employers across all industries, making it one of the most compelling skills on your resume.\nSo, regardless of your job description or your career level, you're always expected to find solutions for problems, either independently or as a part of a team. \nAnd that's precisely what makes problem-solving skills so invaluable and universal! \nWondering how good is your resume?\nFind out with our AI Resume Checker! Just upload your resume and see what can be improved.\nCheck my resume\nThe best 7 problem solving skills examples\nAs we've said before, problem-solving isn't really just one single skill. \nInstead, your ability to handle workplace issues with composure depends on several different “sub-skills”. \nSo, which specific skills make an employee desirable even for the most demanding of recruiters? \nIn no particular order, you should focus on these 7 skills: \nAnalytical skills\nResearch skills\nCritical thinking \nCreativity\nDecision-making\nCollaboration\nHaving a growth mindset\nLet's have a look at each of them in greater detail!\n#1 Analytical skills\nFirstly, to truly understand complex problems, you need to break them down into more manageable parts. Then, you observe them closely and ask yourself: “Which parts work and which don't,” How do these parts contribute to the problem as a whole,” and \"What exactly needs to be fixed?” In other words, you gather data, you study it, and compare it - all to pinpoint the cause of the issue as closely as possible.\n#2 Research skills\nAnother priceless tool is your research skills (sometimes relying on just one source of information isn't enough). Besides, to make a truly informed decision, you'll have to dig a little deeper. Being a good researcher means looking for potential solutions to a problem in a wider context. For example: going through team reports, customer feedback, quarterly sales or current market trends.  \n#3 Critical thinking\nEvery employer wants to hire people who can think critically. Yet, the ability to evaluate situations objectively and from different perspectives, is actually pretty hard to come by. But as long as you stay open-minded, inquisitive, and with a healthy dose of skepticism, you'll be able to assess situations based on facts and evidence more successfully. Plus, critical thinking comes in especially handy when you need to examine your own actions and processes. \n #4 Creativity\nInstead of following the old established processes that don't work anymore, you should feel comfortable thinking outside the box. The thing is, problems have a nasty habit of popping up unexpectedly and rapidly. And sometimes, you have to get creative in order to solve them fast. Especially those that have no precedence. But this requires a blend of intuition, industry knowledge, and quick thinking - a truly rare combination. \n#5 Decision-making\nThe analysis, research, and brainstorming are done. Now, you need to look at the possible solutions, and make the final decision (informed, of course). And not only that, you also have to stand by it! Because once the train gets moving, there's no room for second guessing. Also, keep in mind that you need to be prepared to take responsibility for all decisions you make. That's no small feat! \n#6 Collaboration\nNot every problem you encounter can be solved by yourself alone. And this is especially true when it comes to complex projects. So, being able to actively listen to your colleagues, take their ideas into account, and being respectful of their opinions enables you to solve problems together. Because every individual can offer a unique perspective and skill set. Yes, democracy is hard, but at the end of the day, it's teamwork that makes the corporate world go round. \n#7 Having a growth mindset\nLet's be honest, no one wants their work to be riddled with problems. But facing constant challenges and changes is inevitable. And that can be scary! However, when you're able to see these situations as opportunities to grow instead of issues that hold you back, your problem solving skills reach new heights. And the employers know that too!\n\nHow to develop problem solving skills\nNow that we've shown you the value problem-solving skills can add to your resume, let's ask the all-important question: “How can I learn them?”\nWell…you can't. At least not in the traditional sense of the word. \nLet us explain: Since problem-solving skills fall under the umbrella of soft skills, they can't be taught through formal education, unlike computer skills for example. There's no university course that you can take and graduate as a professional problem solver. \nBut, just like other interpersonal skills, they can be nurtured and refined over time through practice and experience. \nUnfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all approach, but the following tips can offer you inspiration on how to improve your problem solving skills:\nCultivate a growth mindset. Remember what we've said before? Your attitude towards obstacles is the first step to unlocking your problem-solving potential. \nGain further knowledge in your specialized field. Secondly, it's a good idea to delve a little deeper into your chosen profession. Because the more you read on a subject, the easier it becomes to spot certain patterns and relations.  \nStart with small steps. Don't attack the big questions straight away — you'll only set yourself up for failure. Instead, start with more straightforward tasks and work your way up to more complex problems. \nBreak problems down into more digestible pieces. Complex issues are made up of smaller problems. And those can be further divided into even smaller problems, and so on. Until you're left with only the basics. \nDon't settle for a single solution. Instead, keep on exploring other possible answers.\nAccept failure as a part of the learning process. Finally, don't let your failures discourage you. After all, you're bound to misstep a couple of times before you find your footing. Just keep on practicing. \n\nHow to improve problem solving skills with online courses\nWhile it’s true that formal education won’t turn you into a master problem solver, you can still hone your skills with courses and certifications offered by online learning platforms:\nAnalytical skills. You can sharpen your analytical skills with Data Analytics Basics for Everyone from IBM provided by edX (Free); or Decision Making and Analytical Thinking: Fortune 500 provided by Udemy (＄21,74).\nCreativity. And, to unlock your inner creative mind, you can try Creative Thinking: Techniques and Tools for Success from the Imperial College London provided by Coursera (Free).\nCritical thinking. Try Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking Specialization from Duke University provided by Coursera (Free); or Logical and Critical Thinking offered by The University of Auckland via FutureLearn.  \nDecision-making. Or, you can learn how to become more confident when it's time to make a decision with Decision-Making Strategies and Executive Decision-Making both offered by LinkedIn Learning (1 month free trial).\nCommunication skills. Lastly, to improve your collaborative skills, check out Communicating for Influence and Impact online at University of Cambridge. \nProblem solving skills resume example\nThe fact that everybody and their grandmothers put “problem-solving skills” on their CVs has turned the phrase into a cliche. \nBut there's a way to incorporate these skills into your resume without sounding pretentious and empty. Below, we've prepared a mock-up resume that manages to do just that.\nFYI, if you like this design, you can use the template to create your very own resume. Just click the red button and fill in your information (or let the AI do it for you).\nProblem solving skills on resume example\n\nThis resume was written by our experienced resume writers specifically for this profession.\nCreate your resume\nWhy this example works?\nFirstly, the job description itself is neatly organized into bullet points. \nInstead of simply listing soft skills in a skills section, you can incorporate them into the description of your work experience entry. \nAlso, the language here isn't vague. This resume puts each problem-solving skill into a real-life context by detailing specific situations and obstacles. \nAnd, to highlight the impact of each skill on your previous job position, we recommend quantifying your results whenever possible. \nFinally, starting each bullet point with an action verb (in bold) makes you look more dynamic and proactive.\nKey takeaways: Problem solving skills\nTo sum it all up, problem-solving skills continue gaining popularity among employers and employees alike. And for a good reason!\nBecause of them, you can overcome any obstacles that stand in the way of your professional life more efficiently and systematically. \nIn essence, problem-solving skills refer to the ability to recognize a challenge, identify its root cause, think of possible solutions, and then implement the most effective one. \nBelieving that these skills are all the same would be a serious misconception. In reality, this term encompasses a variety of different abilities, including:\nAnalytical skills\nResearch skills\nCritical thinking \nCreativity\nDecision-making\nCollaboration\nHaving a growth mindset\nIn short, understanding, developing, and showcasing these skills, can greatly boost your chances at getting noticed by the hiring managers. So, don't hesitate and start working on your problem-solving skills right now!","URL Slug":"7-problem-solving-skills-that-aren’t-just-buzzword","Meta Description":"Learn how to 7 Problem Solving Skills That Aren’t Just Buzzwords (+ Resume Example) and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

Yet, when you look at the two pages in front of you, it might feel like everything on them is too important to leave out.\n\nLet’s get real. People who can justify using a two-page resume usually don’t need to read articles like this one. The chances are you’re looking for an internship or an entry-level position. Believe me, if that’s the case one page is going to be more than enough.\n\nSo how do you make your resume lose weight without sacrificing its ability to communicate how amazing you are?\n\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n\n1. Adjust the formatting of your resume\n2. Not every piece of information warrants having its own line\n3. Use a column-based layout\n4. Remove repetitions in your work descriptions\n5. Only include relevant information\nRemember the point of having your resume on one page\n\n\n\n1. Adjust the formatting of your resume\nThe looks and content of your resume should always work in unison to achieve maximum readability. Don’t leave it to your editing software’s default settings. You can reclaim much of the space on the page by using these simple tricks:\n\nMost text editors are needlessly generous when it comes to the default size of page margins. It’s never a mistake to make them a bit smaller.\nYou don’t have to use the 12pt font size just because it was standard for your college essays. It’s okay to use a slightly smaller font, just don’t overdo it. Remember that 11pt size is the recommended minimum.\nUse bold and coloured text instead of bigger font for headings.\nAdjust the line spacing. Single-space your bullets but keep larger spacing between sections. This way you’ll get some space while preserving the readability of your resume.\nDo all of these things in moderation and never sacrifice the readability of your resume. If you fill it with an overwhelmingly large amount of text, recruiters and hiring managers will discard your resume straight away.\n\n2. Not every piece of information warrants having its own line\nIf your resume’s too long, the chances are you’ve dedicated separate lines to information that could’ve been grouped together.\n\nConsolidate your contact information. Instead of Email: hello@kickresume.com you can simply write hello@kickresume.com, followed by other contact details in the same format. This way you can fit all your contact information on a single line.\nCreate multi-use lines. In every section, look for opportunities to group connected information together. For example, in your subheadings put the name of each position, time period, and the name of the company in the same line. Also make sure to conflate you bullet points by grouping achievements of the same type together.\nresume on one page\n3. Use a column-based layout\nIn sections where your bullet points don’t fill an entire line, using columns will save you a lot of space. Notice how most visually appealing resumes use column-based layouts.\n\nThe great thing about using columns is how they naturally allow you to structure your resume vertically as well as horizontally. Not only they will help you fit your resume on one page, they’ll also increase your chances of getting an interview by making your resume easier to read.\n\n4. Remove repetitions in your work descriptions\nThe chances are you’ve had a few similar jobs in your career, all of which involved similar type of responsibilities. If you list these responsibilities over and over again on your resume, you’re wasting precious space.\n\nThe responsibilities are often sufficiently evident from job titles alone. Instead of enumerating these, provide an employer with a succinct list of notable accomplishments from your previous job — they are more likely to be unique to every work experience. Doing this may not only help you save some space, it will make your resume more impactful.\n\n5. Only include relevant information\nIf you feel like everything on your resume is relevant, you need to readjust your focus. Once you’ve done everything above but still didn’t succeed at fitting your resume on one page, you’re going to have to cut stuff:\n\nDon’t bother putting your high school diploma on a resume.\nWork experience from 10 years ago is hardly relevant today.\nIf your hobbies aren’t directly connected to a target position, delete your interests section.\nConsider removing your professional summary.\nLeave out “References available upon request,” that’s a given.\nErase soft skills; they should be immediately discernible from your accomplishments.\nDon’t include a photo of yourself on resume.\nMost of all, however, carefully reread the target job description and write down the most important skills it requires. Now go back to your overly extensive resume and cut anything that does not relate. The point is to make your resume about meeting the needs of a target company, not about yourself.\n\nShow off your career at-a-glance.\nCreate a beautiful column-based resume.\n\nCreate resume\nRemember the point of having your resume on one page\nOn average, recruiters spend about 6 seconds on each resume before moving on to another. You only have about 6 seconds to leave a lasting impression. The shortness of this time is the reason why your resume also needs to be short.\n\nWhen you’ll be chopping off parts of your resume, remember that fitting your resume on one page is only one side of the coin. In the end, everything on your resume has to contribute to its maximum relevancy and readability. Only then it can give recruiters all the information they want as effectively as possible.\n\nFeeling inspired to keep your resume snappy and fitting on one page? Great! Now it's time to create one that maintains quality while staying concise. Turn your LinkedIn profile into a precise, condensed resume that speaks volumes.","Meta Description":"Learn how to 5 Quick Tips to Fit Your Resume on One Page and gain insights from real examples."}}]}

Sometimes we get laid off, get fired and have to start looking for a new job.\nMost of us—for one reason or another—have experienced taking some time off from work.\nWhile none of these events should automatically jeopardize your future job prospects, they'll inevitably make you wonder what to do with employment gaps on your resume.\nBut don't worry. We've packed this short resume guide with some very specific examples to help you get started. \nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\nTypes of employment gaps\n1. Change the way you write the dates\n2. Consider changing the format of your resume\n3. Make the most of your employment gap\n4. Boost your credibility with references \nEmployment gap on a resume: Examples\nTypes of employment gaps\nThere are two basic criteria you need to consider when thinking about the seriousness of an employment gap on your resume: their duration and their age.\nShort gaps don't matter. These can be explained away by saying you were looking for a job. Work gaps don't generally become red flags unless they lasted for more than six months.\nOld gaps don't matter either. Recruiters are interested in recent history and won't investigate things that no longer pertain to the present situation. \nIt's okay to take a break.\nGet your career back on track with a new resume.\nCreate resume\nBut maybe your resume employment gaps were recent and quite long. What to do then?\nHiding these gaps makes no sense—your future employer is going to find out anyway. Lying or making stuff up is even worse. Still, you don't want to leave your employment gaps unexplained.\nThere are four easy ways to do that. Keep reading, we're going to explain everything.\n\n1. Change the way you write the dates\nOne way to eliminate a shorter employment gap on resume is to change the formatting of your work experience section.\nThe good news is that you don't really need to list specific months for positions that span multiple years.\nHere's the conventional month-and-year option:\n• Digital Finance Manager, Deloitte (October 2017 – August 2019)\n• Engagement Financial Advisor, Accenture (September 2014 – January 2017)\nThis format lets hiring managers see a 9-month long gap right away. Without any further explanation, this may make them feel a bit suspicious about the job seeker's career path.\nNow, let's use the same listing but remove the months:\n• Digital Finance Manager, Deloitte (2017 – 2019)\n• Engagement Financial Advisor, Accenture (2014 – 2017)\nOnce we exclude them from the resume—poof!—the gap will disappear. \nIt goes without saying that this technique works for employment gaps that took place within a single calendar year. And if you choose this strategy, remember to apply this formatting throughout your entire resume. \n\nOnce you've done that, remember to edit your LinkedIn profile and make these changes there, too.\n2. Consider changing the format of your resume\nYou're the designer of your own resume. Everything—from the text size to the page layout—is in your hands.\nChanging the resume format is the best way to redirect the employer's attention to the skills you have while not dwelling too much on the employment gap.\nIf your goal is to make your employment gap less visible, you definitely want to use the functional resume format.\nThis resume format shifts the attention to your strengths and job-relevant skills rather than your work history.\nThis resume does a good job doing just that:\nMicrosoft Cloud Program Manager Resume Example\n\nThis resume sample was contributed by a real person who got hired with Kickresume’s help.\nUse this sample as your first draft\nFunctional resume format comes especially handy if you spent your time out of work doing things unrelated to work or if it concerns personal family situations that you’d prefer not to detail.\nIf changing your resume format isn't really an option, remember that small design and formatting choices can make a big difference, too.\nYou can try simple techniques such as putting dates in your work history in plain font instead of bold or using a smaller font to put emphasis on the company names and your job titles instead.\n\n3. Make the most of your employment gap\nIf you spent your time away from work doing meaningful activities, it makes your life a whole lot easier. \nStarting a business, freelancing, studying, volunteering, taking a purposeful sabbatical—all these things count as valuable experience that belongs in your resume.\nList these experiences along with other positions you held in the work experience section of your resume. Tailor the description to describe the activities that helped you expand your skillset. \nFocus on the core facts and explain the situation clearly but briefly. Avoid stuffing your resume with a ton of personal details, they'll just make your story sound unprofessional and highly confusing.\nUse action verbs, power adjectives, and numbers to quantify your accomplishments. List specific examples to demonstrate the transferable skills you've acquired.\nVolunteer at Teachaway (September 2018 – August 2019)\nTaught eight 90-minute classes of conversational English per week to adult learners in Zhangye, China.\nDeveloped curriculum for 3 levels of English speakers (elementary, intermediate and advanced)\nBrainstormed and implemented program improvements during weekly meetings\nVolunteer at World Relief Sacramento (November 2018 – June 2019)\nWorked in a transportation team Monday through Friday between 7am and 4pm\nDrove 2000+ miles to transport refugees to important classes, health appointments, school enrollment or other critical appointments during their initial resettlement period\nStrived to achieve a high degree of patience, understanding, flexibility, and self-awareness.\n4. Boost your credibility with references \nAnother effective way to balance out your employment gap is to include references in your resume.\nRecruiters love them. The opportunity to get instant—and often fairly objective—feedback on your performance and professional qualities is priceless.\nGo ahead and ask your former employers, ex-colleagues and other industry professionals if they are willing to vouch for you. Check out the guide on how to get references with email examples.\nThen put down their names and contact information directly in your resume or make it clear that you’ll provide them upon request.\nOption 1\nProf. Jeremy Carter, Senior Lecturer MIT, +999 999 999\nNoah Maroon, Wildlife Species Expert, World Wildlife Fund, hello@kickresume.com\nDr. Jenny Randolph, Assistant Research Professor, Paul G. Allen School of Global Animal Health, Washington State University, +123 456 789\nOption 2\nReferences available upon request\nEmployment gap on a resume: Examples\nMaternal leave\n“After a successful seven-year career as a computer programmer for Cisco, I took time off to raise a family and then completed my master’s degree in Business Intelligence. During that period, I have been preparing for the next step in my career development by developing the exact set of skills that your company is presently seeking.”\nEmployee layoff\n“I spent 15 years working in the automobile industry, with the last seven of those years employed as a Senior District Service Manager. After the automobile industry moved its operations abroad several years ago, our factory was closed and all local employees were laid off. In the time since that closing, I’ve completed (insert educational accomplishment or training) to develop the skills needed for this job.”\nHealth condition\n“After spending 10 years as an accountant I had to take a break to deal with a serious medical condition. During this time I kept my finger on the pulse of the most recent development in marketing and sales. I’ve fully recovered and am really excited to join the workforce again.”\nIllness of a family member\n“After working for 6 years as a financial analyst at PriceWaterCoopers, I served for 9 months as a caregiver and estate manager for an elderly relative, handling all medical and financial concerns.”\nAccident\n“I was seriously injured in a car accident. After several rounds of surgery, I completely recovered and returned to all of my activities, including swimming and checkers.”\nTravel\n“During the gap in employment that lasted from December 2018 through 2019, I traveled to Yosemite National Park to rock climb routes ranging in difficulty from 5.5 to 5.14 (YDS free climbing rating). It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that helped me find my big, audacious career goal. I also picked up a unique set of logistics skills I think will fit extremely well with your current opening.”\nAlways look on the bright side of your employment gap\nJob seekers tend to be too apologetic about their work history—and yet no one's career path is truly without blame.\nRemember that dwelling on negatives isn't going to help anyone. Taking time off is not something that you should feel ashamed of and that should paralyse you in your job search. \nStand by your past decisions and focus on the good things that arose from any difficult situation in your life. Market your skills using a suitable resume format, be prepared to answer inquisitive questions and make sure to present yourself in the best light possible during the job interview.\nYou can also use your cover letter to provide detailed explanation and make the hiring managers mainly think of the value you bring to the table.\nSuch proactive approach will let you bridge that employment gap eventually.\nBridge the gap.\nGet hired asap with an outstanding resume.\nCreate resume\nFeeling more confident about addressing employment gaps in your resume now? Excellent! Why not take the next forward leap and turn your LinkedIn profile into a polished, professional resume?

Well, your first step is creating a standout internship resume that grabs attention. \nBut then you might think, “I don’t have any work experience yet—how can I make my resume strong?”\nDon’t worry—we’ve got you covered! We’ll show you exactly how to highlight your skills and extracurriculars to build an impressive internship resume, even if you’ve never had a job before.\nPlus, we'll show you 3 internship resume examples you can use as your first draft or simply get inspired by. \nWhat is a resume for an internship?\nUnlike a typical resume used for regular job applications, which focuses mainly on your work experience, an internship resume (a.k.a. a resume you'd use to apply for internships) should focus on showcasing your skills, education, and extracurricular activities. \nEssentially, it’s just like a regular resume, but it highlights different sections, since you likely don’t have much work experience yet.\nEmployers don’t expect a long list of past jobs, since internships are often the first step in your career.\nInstead, they’re looking for potential, enthusiasm, and a willingness to learn. Which is what your internship resume needs to reflect. \n\nHow to write a resume for an internship? \nIf you're struggling with creating your internship resume, we've broken it down into 5 simple steps. With these steps, you can build an impressive resume for an internship—even if you've never had a job before.\nPick a functional resume format.\nInstead of using the classic reverse-chronological resume format, which primarily highlights your work experience, go with a functional resume format, which lets you highlight your soft and hard skills (and steer attention away from your lack of work experience.)\nUse a resume objective instead of a resume summary.\nSimilarly, instead of choosing to write a resume summary on the top of your resume, go for a resume objective. It's not heavy on your work history and achievements but rather focuses on your future career goals, your motivation, and showing your enthusiasm. Which is what the recruiters are looking for.\nHighlight your skills.\nWhen applying for an internship, you might not have much work experience yet. But what you do have are valuable skills—whether from school projects, courses, or extracurricular activities. Be sure to put those front and center on your resume!\nShow off your education.\nAs a student or recent graduate, your education is probably your strongest asset. Make it a priority by listing it before your work experience. Make sure to highlight your academic achievements, projects, relevant courses, and even your thesis if it's relevant to the internship.\nCreate a dedicated “projects” section.\nIncluding a separate projects section in a resume isn't common, but it can be a game-changer. It provides tangible proof of your skills and demonstrates your proactiveness. List your academic projects, GitHub contributions, or freelance projects. Be sure to include URL links to your projects—that way you're showing concrete examples instead of just listing them on paper.\nNow, let's look at these steps in greater detail. \nStep 1: Pick a functional resume format\nChoosing the right resume format is your first task. The format decides what section of your resume will stand out, based on how you order them.\nIf you don’t have a lot of work experience, picking a format that focuses mostly on your work history (like the reverse-chronological format) might not be the best option.\nHere are the three most popular resume formats:\nReverse-chronological. Focuses on your job history, listing your most recent job first. This is great for seasoned professionals who already have tons of experience.\nFunctional (also called skills-based resume). This format emphasizes your skills over work experience, making it perfect for interns and students. It answers the question “What can you do?” rather than “Show me where you worked.”\nHybrid. A balanced mix of work experience and skills. It’s a good option if you have some experience but want to highlight your skills too.\nSince internships are often for students or people without much experience, the functional format is definitely the best choice. \nStep 2: Use a resume objective instead of a resume summary\nA key part of any resume is a brief statement at the top, known as a resume summary or resume objective. Although these terms are often used interchangeably, a resume objective is not the same as a resume summary!\nWhat's the difference between a resume summary and a resume objective? \nResume summary. It's looking at the past–focuses on highlighting your experience, skills, and achievements to show why you're a great fit for the job. It’s often used by candidates with more experience to showcase what they bring to the role.\nResume objective. It's looking at the future–focusing on your career goals and what you hope to achieve in the job you're applying for. It’s a great choice for interns, students, and first-time job seekers, as it shows enthusiasm for the role.\nNaturally, then, our advice is to go with a resume objective. Highlight your career aspirations and explain how this opportunity aligns with your goals.\nUse this section to show the employer why this internship is the perfect next step for you.\nAnd if you're still not sure how to write a resume objective, check out our guide for helpful tips and examples.\nStep 3: Highlight your skills\nWhen applying for an internship, your skills are your biggest advantage.\nWhy? \nMost interns don’t have much work experience yet, but that doesn’t mean you lack the qualifications. You likely already have relevant skills that prove you’re ready to succeed, even as an intern.\nThink about the projects you completed in university, the courses you took, and the tools or software you learned to use. \nBeyond that, you might have experience from volunteer work, part-time jobs, or leadership roles in clubs. All of these experiences demonstrate valuable skills that can set you apart—so make sure to highlight them!\nFor the most impact, divide your skills into: \nHard skills. These are technical abilities and knowledge from studies (specific computer skills like programming languages). Try to be as specific as possible for the internship you're applying for, as recruiters often look for them when looking for interns.\nSoft skills. These skills are more part of your personality. It shows your abilities to work with others, and ability to adapt to different situations. These include skills like communication skills, problem-solving, and teamwork. \nTo make the skills section even more engaging, organize your skills into more relevant categories such as programming languages, languages, or soft skills.\nAim to include 10–15 key skills that show you have the potential to succeed in the role.\nStep 4: Show off your education\nYour education is your second biggest asset as an aspiring intern, so don’t be afraid to use it to your advantage. \nDon't just include your school, degree, and graduation date. Go a step further and consider including also:\nRelevant coursework\nGPA (if higher than 3.5)\nAwards (Dean’s list, magna cum laude, subject-based awards)\nScholarships\nRelevant student societies (especially if you were in the committee and played an active role)\nAcademic publications\nStudying abroad\nInternships \nThesis name and description\nThink of your education as more than just a list. Highlight what’s most relevant to the internship you're applying for. \nIf you were part of any projects or student organizations that taught you valuable skills, mention those too!\nStep 5: Create a dedicated “projects” section \nProjects on resume aren't super common yet, which is why it can really help your resume stand out. \nThis is basically a section where you list any independent projects you did. These can be: \nPersonal project, like a personal blog, a website or an app you created, or a graphic design portfolio.\nAcademic projects, like research papers, group projects, case studies, or presentations you completed as part of your coursework.\nFreelance projects, like managing a social media campaign for a small business, writing content for a website, or creating logos and branding materials for clients.\nProgramming projects, like coding a game, building a data analysis tool, or contributing to open-source software on GitHub.\nFor each project, include a brief description outlining your role, the skills you used, and, most importantly, a URL link so that recruiters can see the actual work or results.\nEmployers will love this because it's a tangible proof of your skills and it demonstrates your proactiveness, interest, and initiative. \nAnd, If you want to go the extra mile, consider adding optional sections like:\nVolunteering\nReferences\nCourses \nCertifications\nGitHub contributions\nAwards and achievements\nInternship resume examples\nNow, it's time to look at 3 internship resume examples that helped real people secure internships. \nYou can use them for inspiration or even use them as your first draft.\nPS: Some of these resumes are longer than one page.

This document accompanies your resume and is tailored to a specific job posting. It explains why you're interested in the job and why you're a good fit, focusing on your accomplishments, skills, and experience.\nMotivation letter. This is more general and often used for academic programs or volunteer opportunities. It explains why you're applying for a specific program, focusing on your passions and goals, and how the opportunity will help you achieve them.\nAn internship cover letter combines elements of both—a cover letter (showing why you’re a good fit for the role) and a motivation letter (sharing your personal motivations and goals).\nHowever, a good internship cover letter should address a few key points, such as:\nWho you are\nWhy you’re interested in the internship\nWhy you’re the best fit for the company\nWhat you hope to gain from this internship\nWant to see some examples? You'll find 5 internship cover letter examples belonging to real people in this article: How to Write a Cover Letter for an Internship? (+5 Real Internship Cover Letter Examples)\nHow to put internship on resume?\nSay you’ve already done an internship, or maybe even a few, and now you're applying for a new job. Should you include them on your resume? \nThe first question to ask is: Is the internship relevant to the job?\nIf the answer is no, it depends on the rest of your resume.\nBut if the answer is yes, then absolutely include it.\nNow, where should it go on your resume? \nConsider creating a separate section called Projects and Internships where you can highlight all the key projects you’ve worked on or internships you’ve completed.\nAlternatively, you can include your internship in the work experience section, making sure to list your role as \"Intern\" to clearly show it's an internship, not a full-time job.\nKey takeaways: Internship resume\nSo, how do you write a strong internship resume? Let’s break it down.\nSince inspiring interns often don’t have much work experience, crafting a solid internship resume is a bit different and needs to focus on other aspects, rather than just work experience.\nTo create a successful internship resume, follow these 5 steps:\nPick a functional resume format.\nUse a resume objective instead of a resume summary.\nHighlight your skills.\nShow off your education.\nCreate a dedicated “projects” section.\nRemember, this resume is your chance to show your potential and your motivation, rather than extensive work history."}}]}

For this reason, we put a lot of thought into every single one of them.\n\nIn this article, we want to expose the key concepts behind three of our resume templates—Visibility, Midnight/Midday, and Ladder. \n\nWe hope that once you understand the creative process behind them, you'll be able to make even better resumes than you do now.\n\nKickresume Minimalistic Resume Templates\nTable of Contents\nClick on a section to skip\n\nVisibility: The Minimalistic All-Rounder\nMidnight & Midday: The Polar Opposites\nLadder: The Conservative Overachiever\nWhat are our resume template design principles?\nCustomisation is where YOU come into play. Be careful to keep your minimalistic resume templates minimalistic.\nVisibility: The Minimalistic All-Rounder\nVisibility Minimalistic Resume Templates\nThe main idea behind this resume template is a paradox—to make your content more visible through a clever use of invisible cues.\n\nIn other words, this resume template aims to do a lot with little, while following our main design principles (more on those below).\n\nRecommended jobs? Visibility is an jack-of-all-trades resume template, fitting for any type of position and industry. Whether you’re looking for a job in a corporation or a small company, it will never let you down.\n\nIts understated elegance will always stand out without making you look weird or eccentric.\n\nMidnight & Midday: The Polar Opposites\nAccording to most designer guidelines, a white background allows the reader breathe. On the web, this is a good thing because you're constantly bombarded by visual stimuli.\n\nHowever, when you're choosing a resume template, you want to make hiring managers lose their breath. Midnight's black background does just that.\n\nMidnight catches attention like no other resume template. And then, ehm, blends into the background.\n\nIn the end, its black background doesn't diminish the readability of the resume. As soon as a hiring manager gets sucked in, it becomes almost imperceptible.\n\nMidnight Midday Minimalistic Resume Templates\nMidday is a different beast entirely—the polar opposite of Midnight. For the most formal types of jobs, you want to exhibit a certain decorum and stick to white colour. Still, Midday absorbs the reader by creating a negative space.\n\nNotice how the black header accentuates the body of this resume template. It attracts attention by emphasising the emptiness of white space. After all, this is the main strength of all minimalistic resume templates.\n\nRecommended jobs? Managerial and executive positions. Midnight and Midnight both exude dominance and unwavering self-confidence. Exactly the qualities a candidate for these jobs would want to communicate.\n\nLadder: The Conservative Overachiever\nLadder is one of those minimalistic resume templates that simply get the job done and not much beyond that. It catches a hiring manager's attention but never tries to impress—it stays close to the ground no matter what.\n\nAnd for certain types of jobs, it's exactly what you want to aim for.\n\nLadder Minimalistic Resume Templates\nFor this reason, we recommend sticking to a subdued colour palette. Naturally, you're always welcome to experiment but this resume template works the best when it retains its nearly drab visual. If you really want to play to its strengths, pick a nice serif font to go with it.\n\nRecommended jobs? Accounting, Backend Development, Law Enforcement, legal positions, and the like.\n\nWhat are our resume template design principles?\nGood design always involves a bit of alchemy — that elusive ingredient which turns the whole into more than the sum of its parts.\n\nAnd from our experience, the magic happens when we follow these essential principles:\n\nMaximum readability. All fonts for our resume templates are carefully selected to allow for effortless reading. We know that even a great book, when printed in a terrible font, can be impossible to finish.\nClarity. Hiring managers have painfully short attention spans. For this reason, our resume templates need to visually guide the eye towards the most important parts.\nIndividuality. You want your resume to stand out. We make sure to provide you with a portfolio of striking designs suitable for every industry.\nCustomisation. This is the most difficult part. We always aim to create resume templates that look good in combination with the widest array of fonts and colours, so you can adjust them to the needs of each job application.\nCustomisation is where YOU come into play. Be careful to keep your minimalistic resume templates minimalistic.\nWe're always careful to equip every resume template with a selection of fitting fonts. Many users simply roll with the default resume preset and forget about the customisation options they have at their disposal.\n\nChanging fonts in your resume is a piece of cake. Simply navigate the menu at the left side of your screen and pick the font you like the best.\n\nChange Text Minimalistic Resume Templates\nIn spite of being easy, you should always be careful not to overdo it. Kickresume doesn't support Comic Sans but if you try hard enough, you can ruin your resume equally well.\n\nIn the end, fonts and colours are important. Look at how a resume changes its vibe based on the choice of fonts and colours alone. Keep in mind that in both cases we used the same Midnight template.\n\nMinimalistic Resume Templates Before After\nThe first variant gives a formal impression. Blue headings in combination with a serif font make the owner of this resume seem professional, albeit slightly conservative. It's a resume which inspires confidence above else.\n\nThe second variant looks sleeker and more modern. Yellow headings in combination with a sans-serif font make this resume seem more energetic and unconventional. All of that while maintaining its original rock-solid feel.\n\nMinimalistic resume templates built to be used straight out of the box.\nIf you decide to make adjustments to a resume template, make sure you know what you're doing. A well-aimed modification can tailor your resume to the conventions of a particular company and increase your chances of getting hired.\n\nIf you're not sure, however, you can never go wrong by using a default preset. Our minimalistic resume templates are built to be ready to use straight out of the box and no alterations are usually necessary.\n\nAs you strive for maximum career success, feel free to explore and draw inspiration from our crafted resume samples."}}]}
