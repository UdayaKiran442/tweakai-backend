For millions of Americans, these funds are the cornerstone of their retirement savings, offering professional management and built-in <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">diversification</a> that would be difficult to achieve on their own.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_3-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> In a mutual fund, investors pool their money to buy assets together, benefiting from shared costs and professional expertise. Rather than buying individual stocks or bonds, you buy shares in the fund itself, becoming partial owners of all its holdings.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_5-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> When you invest in a mutual fund, you're essentially hiring professional money managers to make investment decisions on your behalf. These managers research opportunities, select securities, and monitor performance according to the fund's stated objectives—whether that's aggressive growth, steady income, or matching a market index.\\n</p><p>Investopedia / Ellen Lindner</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_12-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Mutual funds are portfolios of investments funded by all those who have bought shares in the fund. When someone buys shares in a mutual fund, they gain part-ownership of all the fund's underlying assets. The fund's performance depends on its assets—if it's full of stocks going up, it will go up. If they're going down, so, too, will the fund.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_14-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> While a mutual fund manager oversees the portfolio, deciding how to divide money across sectors, industries, companies, etc., based on the fund's strategy, many mutual funds are so-called index or <a class=\\\"recommendation-inline-link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passivemanagement.asp\\\" link-destination-recommendation=\\\"true\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">passive funds</a>, with portfolios that shouldn't need too much management.

These mutual funds, which often have years like \\\"2045\\\" or \\\"2050\\\" in their names, start with aggressive growth strategies and gradually become more conservative as you approach retirement.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_36-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> These funds require active management—but not from you. Earlier in your career, the fund might invest 90% of your money in stocks for growth potential. As you near retirement, it shifts more money into bonds and cash to help protect your nest egg from market swings.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_38-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> For example, a 30-year-old planning to retire in 2065 might choose a \\\"2065 Target Date Fund.\\\" Initially, this fund would primarily hold stocks.

Some funds maintain significant stock exposure even after retirement, while others take a more <a class=\\\"recommendation-inline-link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conservativeinvesting.asp\\\" link-destination-recommendation=\\\"true\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">conservative</a> approach.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"64\\\"></span><br>\\n</p><p>More than 90% of employee retirement plans in the U.S. use target date funds as their default.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"65\\\"></span></p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_44-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> This type of fund invests principally in equity or stocks. Within this group are assorted subcategories. Some equity funds are named for the size of the companies they invest in: firms with small-, mid-, or large-sized <a class=\\\"recommendation-inline-link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization.asp\\\" link-destination-recommendation=\\\"true\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">capitalization</a>. Others are named by their investment approach: aggressive growth, income-oriented, and value. Equity funds are also categorized by whether they invest in U.S. stocks or foreign equities. To understand how these strategies and sizes of assets can combine, you can use an equity-style box like the example below.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"3\\\"></span>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_46-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuefund.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Value funds</a> invest in stocks their managers see as undervalued while aiming at long-term appreciation when the market recognizes the stocks' true worth. These companies are characterized by low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, low price-to-book ratios, and dividend yields. Meanwhile, growth funds look to companies with solid earnings, sales, and cash flow growth. These companies typically have high price-to-earnings ratios and do not pay much in dividends.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"25\\\"></span> A compromise between strict value and growth investment is a \\\"blend.\\\" These funds invest in a mix of growth and value stocks to give a risk-to-reward profile somewhere in the middle.\\n</p><p>Investopedia/Julie Bang</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_49-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Large-cap companies have <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">market capitalizations</a> of over $10 billion. Market cap is derived by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. Large-cap stocks are typically for blue-chip firms whose names are recognizable. Small-cap stocks have a market cap between $250 million and $2 billion. These companies tend to be newer, riskier investments. Mid-cap stocks fill in the gap between small- and large-cap.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"18\\\"></span>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_51-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> A mutual fund may combine different investment styles and company sizes. For example, a large-cap value fund might include in its portfolio large-cap companies that are in strong financial shape but have recently seen their share prices fall; these would be placed in the upper left quadrant of the style box (large and value). The opposite of this would be a small-cap growth fund that invests in startup technology companies with high growth prospects. This kind of fund is in the bottom right quadrant above (small and growth).\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_54-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> A mutual fund that generates a consistent and minimum return is part of the <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">fixed-income</a> category. These mutual funds focus on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and other <a class=\\\"recommendation-inline-link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtinstrument.asp\\\" link-destination-recommendation=\\\"true\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\">debt instruments</a>.

These mutual funds will likely pay higher returns but aren't without risk.

A mutual fund can invest in certain assets or take larger positions than a smaller investor could.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_135-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <strong>Professional Management:</strong> A mutual fund is a relatively inexpensive way for a small investor to get a full-time manager to make and monitor investments. Mutual funds require much lower investment minimums, providing a low-cost way for individual investors to experience and benefit from professional money management.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_137-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <strong>Transparency: </strong>Mutual funds are subject to industry regulations meant to ensure accountability and fairness for investors. In addition, the component securities of each mutual fund can be found across many platforms.<br>\\n</p><p>Mutual fund managers are legally obligated to follow the fund's stated mandate and to work in the best interest of mutual fund shareholders.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"23\\\"></span></p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_141-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <a class=\\\"recommendation-inline-link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\\\" link-destination-recommendation=\\\"true\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Liquidity</a>, diversification, and professional management all make mutual funds attractive options. However, there are drawbacks:\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_143-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <strong>No FDIC Guarantee:</strong> Like many other investments without a guaranteed return, there is always the possibility that the value of your mutual fund will <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">depreciate</a>.

Because this cash earns no return, it's called a \\\"cash drag.\\\"\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_147-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <strong>Higher Costs:</strong> Fees that reduce your overall payout from a mutual fund are assessed whatever the performance of the fund. Failing to pay attention to the fees can cost you since actively managed funds incur transaction costs that accumulate and compound year over year.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_149-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <strong>Dilution:</strong> <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Dilution</a> is also the result of a successful fund growing too big. When new money pours into funds with solid track records, the manager could have trouble finding suitable investments for all the new capital to be put to good use.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_151-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The SEC requires that funds have at least 80% of assets in the particular type of investment implied by their title.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"33\\\"></span> How the remaining assets are invested is up to the fund manager. However, the categories that qualify for 80% of the assets can be vague and wide-ranging.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_153-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <strong>End-of-Day Trading Only:</strong> A mutual fund allows you to request that your shares be converted into cash at any time.

ETFs, for example, avoid this through their creation and redemption mechanism. Your taxes can be lowered by investing in tax-sensitive funds or by holding non-tax-sensitive mutual funds in a tax-deferred account, such as a <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">401(k)</a> or <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\">IRA</a>.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"17\\\"></span>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_158-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> When investing in mutual funds, it's essential to <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/mutual_fund_cost.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">understand the fees associated with them</a> since these costs will significantly affect your investment returns over time. Here are some common mutual fund fees:\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_160-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <strong>Expense ratio</strong>: This is an annual fee that covers the fund's operating expenses, including management fees, administrative costs, and marketing expenses.

Pressured by competition from index investing and ETFs, mutual funds have lowered the expense ratio by more than half over the last 30 years (see below).<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"29\\\"></span>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_164-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <strong>Sales charges or loads</strong>: Some mutual funds charge sales fees, known as \\\"<a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/load.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">loads</a>,\\\" when you buy or sell shares.

Unlike stocks, mutual funds do not offer investors the opportunity to juxtapose the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, sales growth, <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\">earnings per share</a>, or other important data. A mutual fund's NAV can offer some basis for comparison, but given the diversity of portfolios, comparing the proverbial apples to apples can be difficult, even among funds with similar names or stated objectives. Only index funds tracking the same markets tend to be genuinely&nbsp;comparable.\\n</p><p>\\\"<a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diworsification.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Diworsification</a>\\\"—a play on words that defines the concept—is an investment term for when too much complexity can lead to worse results. Many mutual fund investors tend to over-complicate matters. That is, they acquire too many funds that are too similar and, as a result, lose the benefits of diversification.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_175-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Index funds</a> are mutual funds that aim to replicate the performance of a market benchmark or index. For example, an S&amp;P 500 index fund tracks that index by holding the 500 companies in the same proportions. A key goal of index funds is minimizing costs to mirror their index closely.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_177-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> By contrast, <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activemanagement.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">actively managed</a> mutual funds try to beat the market by stock picking and shifting allocations. The fund manager seeks to achieve returns greater than a benchmark through their investing strategy and research.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_179-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Index funds offer market returns at lower costs, while active mutual funds aim for higher returns through skilled management that often comes at a higher price. When deciding between index or actively managed mutual fund investing, investors should consider costs, time horizons, and risk appetite.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_184-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Mutual funds and ETFs are pooled investment funds that offer investors a stake in a diversified portfolio. ​However, there are some crucial differences.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_186-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Among the most important is that ETF shares are traded on stock exchanges like regular stocks, while mutual fund shares are traded only once daily after markets close. This means ETFs can be traded anytime during market hours, offering more liquidity, flexibility, and real-time pricing. This flexibility means you can short sell them or engage in the many strategies you would use for stocks.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_188-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Another significant difference is pricing and valuation. ETF prices, like stocks, fluctuate throughout the day according to supply and demand. Meanwhile, mutual funds are priced only at the end of each trading day based on the NAV of the underlying portfolio. This also means that ETFs have the potential for larger premiums/discounts to NAV than mutual funds.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_190-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110314/key-differences-between-etfs-and-mutual-funds.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Compared with mutual funds</a>, ETFs tend to have certain tax advantages and are often more cost-efficient.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"37\\\"></span>\\n</p><p>All investments involve some degree of <a class=\\\"recommendation-inline-link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp\\\" link-destination-recommendation=\\\"true\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">risk</a> when purchasing securities such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds—and the actual risk of a particular mutual fund will depend on its investment strategy, holdings, and manager's competence.

Mutual funds operate at the behest of asset management companies (or AMCs) that pool together investments from multiple individuals along with institutional investors that each have similar investment objectives. Fund managers are responsible for keeping an eye out for and managing these pooled investments. Mutual funds serve as the perfect tool with which individual investors get exposed to portfolios managed by experts. Read on to understand the varied forms of mutual funds that exist in the country.</p><p>Diversify your investment portfolio with various Mutual Funds. There’s a diverse range of options out there, each tailored to specific investment goals, risk levels, asset classes and structures. Whether you're aiming for growth, income or specialised investments, Mutual Funds provide versatile avenues to building wealth.</p><p>An asset class refers to a category of financial assets with similar characteristics and behaviours, such as stocks, bonds, real estate or cash equivalents. Discover diverse Mutual Funds categorised by an asset class.</p><p>Equity Funds (Stocks): <a href=\\\"https://www.icicibank.com/blogs/mutual-fund/equity-funds\\\">Equity Funds</a> invest in shares of companies. For example, large-cap Equity Funds target well-established, large companies, while small-cap funds focus on smaller, high-growth businesses.</p><p>Debt Funds (Bonds): <a href=\\\"https://www.icicibank.com/blogs/mutual-fund/debt-funds\\\">Debt Funds</a> invest in bonds, providing a steady income. They include categories like Government Bond Funds and Corporate Bond Funds.</p><p>Money Market Funds (Short-term securities): Money Market Funds invest in low-risk, short-term securities, such as Treasury bills and commercial paper.</p><p>Hybrid Funds (Mix of assets): <a href=\\\"https://www.icicibank.com/blogs/mutual-fund/what-are-hybrid-funds-and-types-of-hybrid-fund\\\">Hybrid Funds</a> blend both stocks and bonds, like balanced funds that aim for growth and stability in a single package.</p><p>These funds cater to specific financial objectives, offering diverse options to match the investors' unique goals.</p><p>Growth Funds focus on capital appreciation by primarily investing in stocks of companies with high growth potential. They are suited for long-term investors seeking substantial returns.</p><p>Income Funds emphasise regular income generation by investing in bonds, fixed-income securities or dividend-yielding stocks. They suit investors looking for a steady income stream.</p><p><a href=\\\"https://www.icicibank.com/blogs/mutual-fund/liquid-funds\\\">Liquid Funds</a> prioritise liquidity and safety, investing in short-term debt instruments. They are ideal for investors seeking quick access to funds with minimal risk.</p><p><a href=\\\"https://www.icicibank.com/blogs/mutual-fund/elss-funds\\\">Tax-saving funds</a>, also known as ELSS, offer tax benefits under Section 80C. They invest primarily in equities and serve as a tax-efficient investment option.</p><p>Aggressive Growth Funds target substantial capital appreciation and are willing to accept higher market risks. They suit investors with a long-term horizon and a risk-taking approach.</p><p>Capital Protection Funds focus on safeguarding the principal amount while generating modest returns. They are ideal for risk-averse investors looking to protect their investments.</p><p>LFixed Maturity Funds have a predetermined maturity date, providing investors with a clear investment horizon. They are suited for those looking for fixed returns and minimal interest rate risk.</p><p>Pension Funds aim to create a corpus for retirement by investing in a mix of assets. They cater to individuals planning for a secure post-retirement financial future.</p><p>Mutual Funds are categorised by structure, influencing how investors buy and sell units. These structures include open-ended, closed-ended and interval funds.</p><p>Open-ended Funds allow investors to buy and sell units continuously, providing liquidity. These funds are suitable for investors looking for flexibility in terms of entry and exit points and they are commonly used for long-term wealth creation.</p><p>Closed-ended Funds have a fixed maturity period and a limited number of units. Investors can buy units only during the initial offer period and they can trade these units on stock exchanges. These funds are ideal for those seeking long-term investments with potential tax benefits.</p><p>Interval Funds combine features of open and closed-ended funds. They allow periodic redemption requests, typically at predetermined intervals. This structure suits investors looking for a balance between liquidity and long-term investments.</p><p>Different Mutual Funds come with their own level of risk, from very low to high, offering choices for diverse investor profiles.</p><p>Very low Risk Funds, like Money Market Funds, primarily invest in low-risk securities. These are ideal for conservative investors seeking capital preservation and minimal fluctuations in the investment's value.</p><p>Low Risk Funds, such as Government Bond Funds, aim for income generation with a slightly higher risk than very low risk options. They are suitable for investors with a slightly higher risk tolerance.</p><p>Medium Risk Funds, like balanced funds, offer a balance between risk and reward by combining equity and debt investments. These suit investors seeking moderate growth with a manageable level of risk.</p><p>High Risk Funds, such as sector-specific Equity Funds, focus on capital appreciation with increased risk. These are for investors willing to accept higher volatility in pursuit of potentially higher returns.</p><p>Explore unique investment options to diversify and meet specific financial objectives with Specialised Mutual Funds</p><p>Sector Funds focus on specific industries or sectors, allowing investors to target areas they believe will perform well.</p><p>Index Funds replicate a market index's performance, providing low-cost exposure to the overall market or specific segments.</p><p>Funds of Funds invest in other Mutual Funds, offering a diversified portfolio through a single investment.</p><p>Emerging Market Funds invest in developing economies, offering growth opportunities with a higher risk.</p><p>International or Foreign Funds invest outside the investor's home country, diversifying risk and potentially boosting returns.</p><p>Global Funds combine domestic and foreign investments, offering a broad geographic diversification.</p><p>Real Estate Funds invest in properties, providing exposure to the Real Estate market without buying physical assets.</p><p>Commodity-focused Stock Funds invest in companies related to commodities, allowing indirect exposure to the commodity market.</p><p>Market Neutral Funds aim to generate returns while reducing market risks by balancing long and short positions.</p><p>Inverse/Leveraged Funds aim to provide returns inversely related to an index's performance or amplify returns.</p><p>Asset Allocation Funds automatically adjust the portfolio's allocation to maintain a specific risk-return profile.</p><p>Gift Funds are designed for charitable giving, offering tax advantages to donors while supporting causes.</p><p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) combine elements of Mutual Funds and Stocks, providing liquidity and a diversified exposure.</p><p>Investing in <a href=\\\"https://www.icicibank.com/personal-banking/investments/mutual-funds\\\">mutual funds</a> is beneficial for a wide range of reasons. For starters, your investments are handled by experts who know what they are doing which entitles you to not necessarily be entirely proficient with the markets. Most mutual funds aren’t tethered to lock-in periods which makes it easy to withdraw money should you feel the need to. ELSS mutual funds are the sole mutual funds that have a lock-in period. To add to their appeal, mutual funds are easy to invest in owing to the low cost they require which opens up the number of investors that can invest in them. One of the biggest benefits of investing in mutual funds is that it allows you to invest a small amount in a systematic investment plan on a regular basis. Should you find that you would like to move your investments to a varied fund falling under the same fund house, you have the flexibility to do so.</p><p>Allowing for diversification and serving as a form of goal-based funds, mutual funds are highly liquid entitling you as an investor to fall back on these investments in the event that you have a financial crisis. The benefits of mutual funds are vast and should not be dismissed.</p><p><i>For disclaimer, </i><u><a href=\\\"https://www.icicibank.com/blogs/disclaimer/blog-disclaimer\\\"><i>click here</i></a></u></p><p id=\\\"successMsg\\\">Your reference number is <strong>CRM 786578956</strong></p><p style=\\\"font-size: 18.0px;\\\"><b>Share this Blog</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"font-size: 18.0px;\\\"><b>Get social with us.</b></p><p>Share</p><p>Scroll to top</p>\"}"}]}

The increase in the value of the investments is then passed on to the investors/ unit holders in proportion to the number of units owned after deducting applicable expenses.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Mutual funds have both advantages and disadvantages compared to direct investing in individual securities.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Today, they play a vital role in household finances, most notably in retirement planning.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Let's understand the various types of mutual funds in India here.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The</span> <span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">mutual fund</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> industry is continuously emerging. Several industrial bodies are also investing in investor education. Yet, according to a report by Boston Analytics, less than 10% of our households do not consider mutual funds as an investment avenue.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In fact, a basic inquiry about the types of mutual fund reveals that these are perhaps one of the most flexible, comprehensive and hassle-free modes of investments, that can accommodate various types of investment needs.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Various types of mutual fund categories are designed to allow investors to choose a scheme based on the risk they are willing to take, the investable amount, their goals, the investment term, etc.</span></p><p>Types of mutual fund schemes based on the maturity period are as follows-<strong><br></strong></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This scheme allows investors to buy or sell units at any point in time. It does not have a fixed maturity date either. You deal directly with the Mutual Fund for your investment and redemption.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The key feature is liquidity. You can conveniently buy or sell your units at net asset value (“NAV”) related prices. The majority of mutual funds, 59% approximately are open-end funds.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This type of scheme has a stipulated maturity period and investors can invest only during the initial launch period known as the New Fund Offer (NFO).</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Once the offer closes, no new investments are permitted. The market price at the stock exchange could vary from the scheme’s</span> <a href=\\\"https://groww.in/p/nav\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Net Asset Value</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> (NAV), because of the demand and supply situation, unit holder’s expectations and other market factors.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Some close ended schemes will give you an additional option of selling your units directly to the mutual funds through periodic repurchase at NAV related prices.</span></p><p><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/p/sebi-securities-and-exchange-board-of-india\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">SEBI</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> Regulations ensure that at least one of the two exit routes are provided to the investor.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It operates as a combination of open and closed ended scheme, it allows investors to trade units at predefined intervals. They may be traded on the stock exchange or they may even be open for sale or redemption during pre-determined intervals at NAV related prices.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">When it comes to selecting a scheme to invest in, one should look for customized advice. Choose the scheme that provides the right combination of growth, stability and income, keeping your risk appetite in mind.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">One of the most important points in the circular is that different types of <a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds\\\">mutual fund</a> schemes should be clearly distinct in terms of investment strategy and asset allocation. The schemes will be broadly classified into following categories</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The existing type of scheme would be replaced with the new type of schemes. Let’s look at each type of scheme</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">SEBI has decided total 11 categories under Equity Schemes but a mutual fund company can only have 10 categories and it has to choose between Value or Contra.

With the growing popularity of shares and mutual funds, this question has become quite common. Both options have unique features, benefits and drawbacks. You should choose the investment option that will help you achieve your individual investment goals.</p><p>Shares or stocks represent ownership in a publicly traded company. A shareholder gets a portion of the company's profits and a say in its decision-making through voting rights. When you buy shares in a company, you essentially become a shareholder and are entitled to a portion of the company's profits and assets. The price of shares is determined by supply and demand in the market. You can buy and sell shares on a stock exchange or through the over-the-counter market.</p><p><a href=\\\"https://www.axisbank.com/retail/investment/mutual-funds/invest-online\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Mutual funds</a> are a type of investment vehicle that pools money from many investors to invest in stocks, fixed income instruments and commodities like gold. The fund is managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions on behalf of the fund's investors. Mutual funds diversify investments across a range of securities to minimise risk, and the pricing is determined by the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund's underlying securities. </p><p>Before you decide which investment option is the best for you, understand the major differences between mutual funds and stocks.</p><p>The debate of the stock market vs mutual funds is never-ending. You should know the pros and cons of both these options before choosing the right one for you.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p>The decision between investing in mutual funds versus stocks depends on several factors, including an individual's investment goals, risk tolerance and financial situation.</p><p><strong>Situation 1: When mutual funds are better?</strong></p><p>You can use Axis Bank’s <a href=\\\"https://www.axisbank.com/retail/calculators/sip-calculator\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">\\nSIP calculator</a>  to estimate the amount of money you will need to invest each month to reach your desired investment goals. The calculator takes into account factors such as investment amount, expected returns and investment period.</p><p><strong>Situation 2: When shares are better?</strong></p><p>The amount you should allocate to mutual funds as part of your overall investment portfolio depends on your financial goals and risk appetite. As a general rule of thumb, it is recommended to have a diversified portfolio that includes a mix of stocks, bonds and other assets. mutual funds can be a valuable component of this diversified portfolio, but it is important to consider specific funds and their investment strategies before making any investment decisions.\\n</p><p>Also Read: <a href=\\\"https://www.axisbank.com/progress-with-us-articles/money-matters/save-invest/differences-between-etf-funds-vs-mutual-funds\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Mutual Funds and ETFs: Know the difference</a></p><p>There is no one right choice when it comes to investment. Your investment portfolio should be based on your financial knowledge, expected returns and risk appetite. If you have a good understanding of the stock market and are ready to assume a higher risk, you can invest in shares. But if you have a low-risk appetite, you should consider putting your money in mutual funds. If you want to build a diversified portfolio, you can invest partially in both mutual funds and shares. \\n</p><p><span class=\\\"disclaimr\\\">Disclaimer: This article is for information purpose only.

Equity mutual funds are those that invest in shares, bonds, and other securities. Conversely, debt mutual funds invest primarily in debt securities such as government and corporate bonds. There are many advantages to investing in equity mutual funds over debt mutual funds. Primarily, these funds offer higher returns and can even outperform inflation. However, as compared to debt funds, they are more risky and sometimes generate volatile returns.</p><p>In this article, we will study the key differences between equity and debt mutual funds and explore the various factors to keep in mind before investing. Also, we will analyse which option might be better for different investor profiles.</p><p>A <a href=\\\"/investments/mutual-funds-listing\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">Mutual Fund scheme</a> is categorised as an Equity Mutual Fund when it allocates over 65% of its total assets to stocks. They are also known as open-ended equity funds. The goal of an equity mutual fund is to provide investors with long-term capital appreciation by investing in stocks of companies that have the potential for growth.</p><p><a href=\\\"/investments/debt-mutual-funds\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">Debt mutual funds</a> are mutual funds that invest primarily in fixed-income securities such as bonds, treasury bills, and commercial paper. The goal of a debt mutual fund is to provide investors with regular income and capital preservation.</p><p>Both equity and debt mutual funds suit different investor profiles. Hence, to make an informed decision, investors must understand the key differences between them primarily related to:</p><p>Let’s understand them in detail:</p><p>Equity funds aim to create long-term wealth by investing mainly in stocks and related financial instruments. On the other hand, debt funds focus on preserving capital and generating income. Usually, they invest in safer, fixed-income instruments like government and corporate bonds, treasury bills, commercial papers, and certificates of deposit.</p><p>Equity funds have the potential for higher returns, but they also come with higher risk. This risk level usually varies depending on the type of equity fund. On the other hand, debt funds aim to preserve capital. Hence, they generally have lower to moderate risk compared to equity funds.</p><p>Mostly, <a href=\\\"/investments/equity-mutual-funds\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">equity mutual fund schemes</a> provide higher returns over the long term compared to debt funds.&nbsp;The returns from debt funds are usually lower to moderate when compared to equity funds.</p><p>Capital gains are classified as short-term or long-term based on how long you hold an asset before selling it. According to the Union Budget 2024, for equity mutual funds, gains are considered long-term if the holding period is 12 months or more. The resulting LTCG (long-term capital gains) is taxed at 12.5% (up from the previous limit of 10%).</p><p>On the other hand, if these units are held for less than 12 months, the arising gains are short-term. The resulting STCG (short-term capital gain) is taxed at 20% (up from the previous limit of 15%).</p><p>There is no distinction based on the holding period when it comes to debt mutual funds. All gains are taxed according to the investor’s applicable tax slab rates.</p><p>Equity funds are suitable for investors looking to achieve long-term financial goals. Their ideal risk appetite lies between moderate and high. Comparatively, debt funds are more suitable for investors with a shorter investment horizon. They are also an ideal investment option for low-risk-appetite individuals seeking higher returns than traditional bank fixed deposits (FDs) and savings accounts.</p><p>Equity mutual funds primarily invest in shares, bonds, and other securities. They aim for higher returns but also carry higher risks due to market volatility. In contrast, debt mutual funds focus on government and corporate debt securities. They offer more stable and lower-risk returns.</p><p>One of the key differences between these <a href=\\\"/investments/types-of-mutual-funds-in-india-a-comprehensive-overview\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">mutual fund types</a> is that equity funds offer high returns and capital growth, while debt funds provide steady income and capital preservation.&nbsp;The choice between them entirely depends on your risk tolerance and investment goals.</p><p>For more clarity, let’s understand the major differences between them below:</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><b>Aspect</b></p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><b>Equity Mutual Funds</b></p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><b>Debt Mutual Funds</b></p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Type of Securities Invested In</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Primarily stocks</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Primarily fixed-income securities such as bonds and treasury bills.</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Risk Profile</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Higher volatility and risk</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Lower volatility and risk</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Return Potential</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Potentially higher returns over the long term but high risk</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Potentially lower returns but more stable source of income over the long term</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Taxation</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">STCG (units sold within 12 months) is taxed at 20%, whereas LTCG (units sold after 12 months) is taxed at 12.5%.</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Gains arising from the sale of units are taxed as per the applicable rates.</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Investment Horizon</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">More suitable for long-term goals</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Suitable for both long-term and short-term goals</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Tax Savings</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">By investing in ELSS funds, a deduction of up to Rs. 1,50,000 can be claimed under Section 80C</p><p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">No such option to save tax is available</p><p>Before investing in equity mutual funds, consider your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Equity funds offer higher potential returns but come with higher risk, while debt funds are safer but offer lower returns.</p><p>Generally, debt funds are considered safer than equity funds because they primarily invest in fixed-income securities with lower volatility. However, the level of safety depends on the credit quality and maturity of the underlying securities.</p><p>The decision to invest in debt or equity depends on factors like investment objectives, risk appetite, market conditions, and investment time horizon. Investors typically consider equity for long-term growth and debt for stability and regular income.</p><p>Yes, investors can diversify their portfolio by investing in both equity and debt mutual funds simultaneously, which helps spread risk and achieve a balance between growth and stability.</p><p>While debt funds are generally considered safer than equity funds, they are not entirely risk-free. Factors like interest rate risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk can affect the performance of debt funds.</p><p>The choice between debt and equity SIP depends on investment goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Equity SIPs offer higher growth potential but come with higher risk compared to debt SIPs, which offer stability and regular income.</p><p>SIP can be both equity and debt, depending on the mutual fund scheme chosen by the investor. Equity SIPs invest in stocks, while debt SIPs invest in fixed-income securities like bonds and government securities.</p><p>Balanced or hybrid mutual fund schemes invest in a mix of debt and equity instruments, providing diversification and balanced returns. These funds allocate assets between equity and debt based on market conditions and investment objectives.</p><p>Equity mutual funds offer the potential for higher returns compared to other investments, like debt mutual funds or traditional fixed deposits. They provide diversification by investing in various stocks, which can help you grow your wealth over the long term. Also, these funds are managed by professional fund managers. They make decisions about which stocks to buy and sell with an objective to maximise returns.</p><p>Before investing in mutual funds, firstly, shortlist schemes that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Then, look at the fund’s past performance and the experience of the fund managers. Also, check out the fee involved, as it directly impacts your overall returns.</p><p>By making such a thorough assessment, you can select the right mutual fund scheme that can fulfil your financial goals.</p><p>Mostly, equity mutual funds offer higher potential returns. However, they also come with higher risk as they invest in stocks. On the other hand, debt mutual funds usually offer lower but more stable returns. Additionally, they carry lower risk because they invest in fixed-income securities like bonds and treasury bills.</p><p>If you have a high risk tolerance and are looking for higher long-term returns, you can choose an equity mutual fund scheme.

They can also watch their investment shrink or disappear entirely if the company runs out of money.</p><p>The stock market is really a kind of aftermarket, where people who own shares in the company can sell them to investors who want to buy them. This trading takes place on a stock exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-nasdaq-composite/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"Nasdaq\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"2\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">Nasdaq</a>. In years past, traders used to go to a physical location — the exchange’s floor — to trade, but now virtually all trading takes place electronically.</p><p>When news people say, “the market was up today,” typically they are referring to the performance of the <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-sp-500/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"Standard &amp; Poor’s 500\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"3\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">Standard &amp; Poor’s 500</a> or the <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-dow-jones-industrial-average/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"Dow Jones Industrial Average\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"4\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a>. The S&amp;P 500 is made up of around 500 large publicly traded companies in the U.S, while the Dow includes 30 large companies. These track the performance of the collections of stock and show how they fared on that day of trading and over time.</p><p>However, even though people are referring to the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 as “the market,” those are really indexes of stocks. These indexes represent some of the largest companies in the U.S., but they are not the total market, which includes thousands of publicly traded companies.</p><p>Of course, you’ll need a <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/how-to-buy-stocks-online/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"brokerage account\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"5\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">brokerage account</a> before you <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-stocks/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"start investing in stocks\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"6\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">start investing in stocks</a>. As you’re getting started, here are eight more guidelines for investing in the stock market.</p><p>Buying the right stock is so much easier said than done. Anyone can see a stock that’s performed well in the past, but anticipating the performance of a stock in the future is much more difficult. If you want to succeed by investing in individual stocks, you have to be prepared to do a lot of work to <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/how-to-research-stocks-like-the-pros/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"analyze a company and manage the investment\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"7\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">analyze a company and manage the investment</a>.</p><p>“When you start looking at statistics you’ve got to remember that the professionals are looking at each and every one of those companies with much more rigor than you can probably do as an individual, so it’s a very difficult game for the individual to win over time,” says Dan Keady, CFP, chief financial planning strategist at TIAA.</p><p>If you’re analyzing a company, you’ll want to look at a company’s fundamentals – <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/earnings-per-share/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"earnings per share (EPS)\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"8\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">earnings per share (EPS)</a> or a <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-the-pe-ratio/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio)\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"9\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio)</a>, for example. But you’ll have to do so much more: analyze the company’s management team, evaluate its competitive advantages, study its financials, including its balance sheet and income statement. And these items are just the start.</p><p>Keady says going out and buying stock in your favorite product or company isn’t the right way to go about investing. Also, don’t put too much faith in past performance because it’s no guarantee of the future.</p><p>You’ll have to study the company and anticipate what’s coming next, a tough job in good times.</p><p>Everyone has heard someone talk about a big stock win or a great stock pick.</p><p>“What they forget about is that often they’re not talking about those particular investments that they also own that did very, very poorly over time,” Keady says. “So sometimes people have an unrealistic expectation about the kind of returns that they can make in the stock market. And sometimes they confuse luck with skill. You can get lucky sometimes picking an individual stock. It’s hard to be lucky over time and avoid those big downturns also.”</p><p>Remember, to make money consistently in individual stocks, you need to know something that the forward-looking market isn’t already pricing into the stock price. Keep in mind that <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/when-to-sell-stock/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"for every seller in the market\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"10\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">for every seller in the market</a>, there’s a buyer for those same shares who’s equally sure they will profit.</p><p>An alternative to individual stocks is an index fund, which can be either a <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/mutual-fund-vs-etf-which-is-better/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF)\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"11\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a>. These funds hold dozens or even hundreds of stocks. And each share you purchase of a fund owns all the companies included in the index.</p><p>Unlike stock, mutual funds and ETFs may have annual fees, <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/low-cost-index-funds-guide/#9-lowest-cost-s-p-500-index-funds\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"though some funds are free or nearly free\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"12\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">though some funds are free or nearly free</a>.</p><p>One of the key advantages of an index fund is that you immediately have a range of stocks in the fund. For example, if you own <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-index-funds/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"a broadly diversified fund based on the S&amp;P 500\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"13\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">a broadly diversified fund based on the S&amp;P 500</a>, you’ll own stocks in hundreds of companies across many different industries. But you could also buy a narrowly diversified fund focused on one or two industries.</p><p>Diversification is important because it reduces the risk of any one stock in the portfolio hurting the overall performance very much, <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/diversification-is-important-in-investing/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"and that actually improves your overall returns\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"14\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">and that actually improves your overall returns</a>. In contrast, if you’re buying only one individual stock, you really do have all your eggs in one basket.</p><p>The easiest way to create a broad portfolio is by buying an ETF or a mutual fund. The products have diversification built into them, and you don’t have to do any analysis of the companies held in the index fund.</p><p>“It may not be the most exciting, but it’s a great way to start,” Keady says. “And again, it gets you out of thinking that you’re gonna be so smart, that you’re going to be able to pick the stocks that are going to go up, won’t go down and know when to get in and out of them.”</p><p>When it comes to diversification, that doesn’t just mean many different stocks. It also means investments that are spread among different industries – since stock in similar sectors may move in a similar direction for the same reason.</p><p>The hardest issue for most investors is stomaching a loss in their investments. And because the stock market can fluctuate, <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-stock-market-correction/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"you will have losses occur from time to time\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"15\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">you will have losses occur from time to time</a>. You’ll have to steel yourself to handle these losses, or you’ll be apt to buy high and sell low during a panic.</p><p>As long as you diversify your portfolio, any single stock that you own shouldn’t have too much of an impact on your overall return. If it does, buying individual stocks might not be the right choice for you. Even index funds will fluctuate, so you can’t get rid of all of your risk, try how you might.</p><p>“Anytime the market changes we have this propensity to try to pull back or to second guess our willingness to be in,” says Madsen of NewLeaf in Redwood Falls, Minnesota.</p><p>That’s why it’s important to prepare yourself for downturns that could come out of nowhere, as one did in 2020. You need to ride out <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-market-volatility/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"short-term volatility to get attractive long-term returns\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"16\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">short-term volatility to get attractive long-term returns</a>.</p><p>In investing, you need to know that it’s possible to lose money, since stocks don’t have principal guarantees. If you’re looking for a guaranteed return, perhaps a <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/cds/cd-rates/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"high-yield CD\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"17\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">high-yield CD</a> might be better.</p><p>The concept of market volatility can be difficult for new and even experienced investors to understand, cautions Keady.</p><p>One way to enter the world of investing without taking risk is to use a stock simulator. Using an online trading account with virtual dollars won’t put your real money at risk. You’ll also be able to determine how you would react if this really were your money that you gained or lost.</p><p>“That can be really helpful because it can help people overcome the belief that they’re smarter than the market, that they can always pick the best stocks, always buy and sell in the market at the right time,” Keady says.</p><p>Asking yourself why you’re investing can help determine if investing in stocks is for you.</p><p>“If their thought is that they’re going to somehow outperform the market, pick all the best stocks, maybe it’s a good idea to try some type of simulator or watch some stocks and see if you could actually do it,” Keady says. “Then if you’re more serious about investing over time, then I think you’re much better off – almost all of us, including myself – to have a diversified portfolio such as provided by mutual funds or exchange traded funds.”</p><p>Bankrate reviewed <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-investment-apps/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"some of the best investing apps\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"18\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">some of the best investing apps</a>, including a few fun <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/ultimate-guide-virtual-trading-stock-market-simulator/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"stock simulators\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"19\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">stock simulators</a>.</p><p>Once you’ve given a stock simulator a try, you may be ready to move onto buying a few stocks or funds of your own through a brokerage account.</p><p>A brokerage account allows you to buy and sell assets like stocks, bonds, mutual funds and more.

He also says you should divorce yourself from the daily news cycle.</p><p>By skipping the daily financial news, you’ll be able to develop patience, which you’ll need if you want to stay in the investing game for the long term. It’s also useful to minimize how often you look at your portfolio , so that you don’t become too unnerved or too excited. These are great tips for beginners who have yet to manage their emotions when investing.</p><p>“Some of the news cycle, at times it becomes 100 percent negative and it can become overwhelming for people,” Keady says.</p><p>One strategy for beginners is to set up a calendar and predetermine when you’ll be evaluating your portfolio. Sticking to this guideline will prevent you from selling out of a stock during some volatility – or not getting the full benefit of a well-performing investment, Keady says.</p><p>Choosing the perfect opportunity to jump in and invest in the stock market typically doesn’t work well. Nobody knows with 100 percent certainty the <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/timing-the-stock-market/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"best time to get in\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"24\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">best time to get in</a>. And investing is meant to be a long-term activity. There is no perfect time to start.</p><p>“One of the core points with investing is not just to think about it, but to get started,” Keady says. “And start now. Because if you invest now, and often over time, that compounding is the thing that can really drive your results. If you want to invest, it’s very important to actually get started and have … an ongoing savings program, so that we can reach our goals over time.”</p><p>Understanding whether you’re investing for the long-term future or the short term can also help determine your strategy – and whether you should be investing at all. Sometimes short-term investors can have unrealistic expectations about growing their money. And research shows that most short-term investors, <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-online-brokers-for-day-trading/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"such as day traders\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"25\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">such as day traders</a>, lose money. You’re competing against high-powered investors and well-programmed computers that may better understand the market.</p><p>New investors need to be aware that <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/active-versus-passive/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"buying and selling stocks frequently\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"26\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">buying and selling stocks frequently</a> can get expensive. It can create taxes and other fees, <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/zero-fee-broker-commissions-long-term-investors-win/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"even if a broker’s headline trading commission is zero\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"27\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">even if a broker’s headline trading commission is zero</a>.</p><p>If you’re investing for the short term, you risk not having your money when you need it.</p><p>“When I’m advising clients … anything under a couple of years, even sometimes three years out, I’m hesitant to take too much market risk with those dollars,” Madsen says.</p><p>Depending on your financial goals, <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/money-market-vs-savings-accounts-vs-cds/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"a savings account, money market account or a short-term CD\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"28\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">a savings account, money market account or a short-term CD</a> may be better options. Experts often advise investors that they should invest in the stock market only if they can keep the money invested for at least three to five years. Money that you need for a specific purpose in the next couple years should probably be invested in <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/low-risk-investments/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"low-risk investments\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"29\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">low-risk investments</a>, such as a <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/best-high-yield-interests-savings-accounts/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"high-yield savings account\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"30\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">high-yield savings account</a> or a high-yield CD.</p><p>It can be easy to dump your money into the market and think you’re done. But those who build real wealth do so over time, by <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-what-it-is-avoids-timing-market/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"adding money to their investments\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"31\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">adding money to their investments</a>. That means having a strong saving discipline – holding back some of your paycheck – so that you can put it to work in the stock market. You’ll be able to put more money to work and grow your wealth even faster.</p><p>You may already be doing this if you have a <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/401k/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"401(k) retirement account\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"32\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">401(k) retirement account</a>, which takes money from your paycheck and puts it into the investments you’ve selected. Even if you don’t have a 401(k), many brokerage accounts allow you to set up automatic transfers to your account. Then you may be able to set up automatic investments at a broker or robo-advisor.</p><p>By automating the investing process, you help keep your emotions out of the process.&nbsp;</p><p>The stock market is really a way for investors or brokers to exchange stocks for money, or vice versa. Anyone who wants to buy stock can go there and <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/how-to-buy-stocks/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"buy whatever is on offer\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"33\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">buy whatever is on offer</a> from those who own the stock. Buyers are expecting their stocks to rise, while sellers may be expecting their stocks to fall or at least not rise much more.</p><p>So the stock market allows investors to wager on the future of a company. Together, investors set the value of the company by what price they’re willing to buy and sell at.</p><p>While stock prices in the market on any day may fluctuate according to how many shares are demanded or supplied, over time the market evaluates a company on its business results and future prospects. A business growing sales and profits will likely see its stock rise, while a shrinking business will probably see its stock fall, at least over time. In the short term, however, the performance of a stock has a lot to do with just the supply and demand in the market.</p><p>When private firms see which stocks investors favor, they may decide to fund their business by selling stock and raising cash. They’ll conduct <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/getting-in-on-an-initial-public-offering/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"an initial public offering, or IPO\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"34\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">an initial public offering, or IPO</a>, using an investment bank, which sells shares to investors. Then investors can sell their stock later in the stock market if they want to or they can buy even more at any time the stock is publicly traded.</p><p>The key point is this: Investors price stocks according to their <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-fundamental-analysis/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"expectations of how the company’s business will perform\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"35\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">expectations of how the company’s business will perform</a> in the future. So the market is forward-looking, with some experts saying the market anticipates events about six to nine months away.</p><p>The stock market allows individual investors to own stakes in some of the world’s best companies, and that can be tremendously lucrative. In aggregate, stocks are a good long-term investment as long as they’re purchased at reasonable prices. For example, over time the S&amp;P 500 has generated about a 10 percent annual return, <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-dividend-stocks/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"including a nice cash dividend, too\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"36\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">including a nice cash dividend, too</a>.</p><p>Investing in stocks also offers another nice tax advantage for long-term investors. As long as you don’t sell your stock, you won’t owe any tax on the gains. Only money that you receive, such as dividends, will be taxable. So you can hold your stock forever and never have to pay taxes on your gains.</p><p>However, if you do realize a gain by selling the stock, <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/long-term-capital-gains-tax/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"you’ll owe capital gains taxes on it\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"37\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">you’ll owe capital gains taxes on it</a>. How long you hold the stock will determine how it’s taxed. If you buy and sell the asset within a year, it will fall under short-term capital gains and will be taxed at your regular income tax rate. If you sell after you’ve held the asset a year, then you’ll pay the long-term capital gains rate, which is usually lower. If you record a loss, <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/tax-loss-harvesting/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"you can write that off your taxes or against your gains\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"38\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">you can write that off your taxes or against your gains</a>.</p><p>While the market as a whole has performed well, many stocks in the market don’t perform well and may even go bankrupt.

Selecting the right investments is important, but there’s more to it than that. You should also craft a set of guiding principles and learn about how financial markets work. Doing so can reduce the risk of making mistakes in the heat of the moment and maximize your returns.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_5-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> This article looks at 10 key rules for making the most of your investments.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_9-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Asset prices generally rise, fall, then rise again. And it’s not all random. These phases of expansion and contraction form part of a cycle that regularly repeats itself.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_11-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> In good times, companies invest, consumers spend, banks lend money at reasonable rates, and most <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">stocks</a> rise in value. The good times don't last forever (indeed, a sign that it's coming to an end is seeing some claiming they never will.) Eventually, costs rise too much and investments fetch more than their historical norms. At this point, a \\\"<a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correction.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\">correction</a>\\\" begins as the economy weakens and investors retreat, paving the way for the cycle to repeat again.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_13-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The key takeaway from this is not to panic when prices start dropping. Over time, the stock market should continue its upward trajectory—historically, it always has, but that's cold comfort in the moment.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_18-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> One of the main reasons investors are advised to establish guidelines before investing is to reduce the chance of emotions getting the better of them. When investors log in to their accounts during bouts of volatility, they tend to be impulsive, buying more of the winners and dumping the losers. Often that turns out to be a mistake.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_20-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <strong>“</strong>The worst investment decisions are those driven by fear or greed,” said Alex Campbell, head of communications at U.K.-based financial technology company FreeTrade. “Take some time to consider the drop in light of your investment strategy and reflect on the move that you feel is right based on the available information.”\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_23-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> “Buying low and selling high\\\" means being a contrarian—buying or selling when others are not. It requires a lot more research on your part. It’s not just a case of buying everything out of favor. The market is generally right and most stocks are cheap for a reason.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_25-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> To be successful, you’ll need to scrutinize the data, be a critical thinker, and not get distracted by what others say. A good starting point is learning to recognize overcorrections. For example, investors can sometimes excessively punish the entire market when the economy is stuttering or oversell specific stocks because of adverse temporary factors.\\n</p><p>Asked what he tells newer investors, Yvan Byeajee, author of <a href=\\\"https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Trading+Composure%3A+Mastering+Your+Mind+for+Trading+Success-p-9781394244461\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"externalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\"><em>Trading Composure: Mastering Your Mind for Trading Success</em></a>, was succinct: \\\"Cultivate a deep embrace of uncertainty.\\\" He added, \\\"It’s not enough to acknowledge uncertainty or <a class=\\\"recommendation-inline-link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0812/5-investing-risk-factors-and-how-to-avoid-them.aspx\\\" link-destination-recommendation=\\\"true\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\">risk</a> intellectually; you need to accept it emotionally and allow them to guide your decision-making without fear or resistance.\\\"</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_29-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Normally, a <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyandhold.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">long-term buy-and-hold strategy</a> is considered the best way to go. However, sometimes it’s necessary to walk away earlier than planned. Byeajee said too many investors approach some investments like the lottery.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_31-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> \\\"This mindset can be disastrous, leading to behaviors like chasing trends, panic selling, or overleveraging—all of which will likely wipe out gains and erode confidence,\\\" he said. \\\"Sustainable investing is about playing the long game, respecting the process, and allowing compounding to work its magic over time.\\\"<strong>&nbsp; </strong>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_33-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> To avoid making mistakes, it’s sensible to draw up an exit strategy at the onset before the investments are made. Common methods include setting price targets, loss limits, and time frames for your investment. You should also consider triggering events that could make you lose confidence and that your <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">risk tolerance</a> could change over time.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_36-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Investors are regularly advised to spread their money across numerous investments. \\\"For most people in most situations, a long-term, buy-and-hold, diversified, low-cost investment approach is likely more suitable than active trading,\\\" said David Tenerelli, a certified financial planner at Values Added Financial Planning in Plano, Texas. \\\"This is because it helps the investor ignore the 'noise' and instead focus on a disciplined approach.\\\"\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_38-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The logic behind diversification is that different assets will react differently to the same events. In theory, that means if one investment does badly, its impact will be limited as the other assets in the portfolio should perform better.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_41-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Stock market indexes track the performance of a selection of publicly traded companies and so function as a barometer of segments of the stock market. There are a variety of indexes to keep tabs on. Some focus on specific sectors or the country’s biggest companies by market cap. For a representation of the entire U.S. stock market, a good place to look is the <a class=\\\"recommendation-inline-link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wilshire5000equityindex.asp\\\" link-destination-recommendation=\\\"true\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Wilshire 5000</a> or <a class=\\\"recommendation-inline-link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell_3000.asp\\\" link-destination-recommendation=\\\"true\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\">Russell 3000</a>.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_44-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Bear markets—when there's a steep drop in asset prices—are less scary when you understand how they work.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_46-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> These periods of prolonged price declines are usually broken down into four distinct phases, which SteelPeak Wealth, a Los Angeles-based wealth management firm, describes as follows:\\n</p><p>Timing the market is extremely difficult. For most investors, the best way to behave during bear markets is to not panic, focus on the long term, and take advantage of <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">dollar cost averaging</a>.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_52-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The internet is littered with predictions from so-called gurus. You’re best off ignoring them. A study from the CXO Advisory Group found that their accuracy was, on average, just under 47%.

Seeing your holdings are shedding value could make you want to dash for the exit and ignore your well-thought-out convictions. That’s the last thing you should do. Remember, markets go through ups and downs but generally rise in value over the long run.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_60-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Markets and prices move up and down. When they are rising, it can be tempting to be overconfident and throw more money at the winners. And when they plummet, you might want to do the opposite and dump everything, especially the laggards. Knowledge of how markets work will hopefully prevent you from panicking or being greedy.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_62-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> If anything, you want to buy when assets you are convinced about are out of favor and sell when everyone is raving about them. Or better yet, do nothing and stick to your strategy. It’s time in the market rather than timing the market that often generates the best returns.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_65-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> There are no guarantees of success in investing. However, if you understand market cycles and how indexes and bear markets work, avoid impulse buying or selling, adopt a contrarian mindset, draft an exit strategy, and maintain a diversified portfolio, you’ll have a much better chance of coming out on top.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_67-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> \\\"To succeed, traders and investors must trust the process even when the outcomes are temporarily unfavorable,\\\" Byeajee said. \\\"This mindset shift isn't just important; it's foundational.

Technicians are usually more short-term traders by nature, contrasting with the long-term <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/fundamentalapproach.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">view fundamentalists generally take</a>.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_16-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Do fundamentals drive technicals or the other way around?&nbsp;In the short run, strong fundamentals do not always indicate strong technical patterns or vice versa.&nbsp;\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_18-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Often, technicals can continue to follow a strong or weak pattern when fundamentals are at turning points, which may lead them to be out of sync.&nbsp;Additionally, technicals can be out of sync with fundamentals when there is a shock to a stock, either positive or negative.&nbsp;\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_20-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Stocks tend to follow technicals in the short run unless there is an unforeseen shock.&nbsp;For example, there are times when stocks start moving before a new&nbsp;material disclosure becomes public.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_22-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Absent insider trading or improper disclosures by not following <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulationd.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Regulation D</a>, technical analysts say you can respond in real-time to a stock and not have to wait for the next reporting date or news disclosure, because the charts already interpret market sentiment, so following the charts will lead to higher profits.&nbsp;\\n</p><p>Technical analysis is primarily used for short-term trading, such as day trading, while fundamental analysis is used for long-term investing, such as buy-and-hold strategies.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_25-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Technical analysts believe that stocks move even without disclosures because suppliers, competitors, employees, and all their family and friends, invest in companies and without needing inside information, get a sense of how the company is faring.&nbsp;\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_27-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> These buying and selling activities define the stock chart and pattern and reflect the real-time stock behavior.&nbsp;\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_29-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> At times when the market is surprised by a new disclosure, the charts may fail, at least initially, and reviewing the fundamentals may lead to long-run profits by taking advantage of short-term mispricing when a surprise causes the markets to overreact.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_31-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> News is temporary and may positively or negatively impact the stock’s fundamentals, so following the fundamentals after a shock may be more prudent. Using technical analysis may provide the opportunity to take advantage of a correction or rebound after the news is absorbed.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_33-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Therefore, even if the two have been out of sync in the short run, technicals and fundamentals should be in sync in the long run. That's&nbsp;because, in the long run, fundamentals should win and drive the technicals.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_36-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Investment time horizon often dictates when technical or fundamental analysis makes sense.&nbsp;Since at points of inflection, it appears that technicals and fundamentals are often out of sync, investment time horizon often comes into play.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_38-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> It is generally believed that short-term investors follow technicals while long-term investors are willing to withstand the day-to-day “blips” and follow fundamentals.&nbsp;\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_40-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> For example, if you believe that genetically modified seeds are&nbsp;the future of farming, then you will probably invest in a relevant company—<a href=\\\"https://www.cropscience.bayer.com/\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"externalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Monsanto</a>,&nbsp;for example—and are willing to stay the course despite any short-term noise the stock may&nbsp;experience.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_43-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Critics argue that fundamental analysis can lead to improper valuations and thus improper investment decisions because the information is for the most part backward-looking.&nbsp;Financial statement analysis, 10Q and 10K commentaries, and macroeconomic environments focus on what already happened.&nbsp;Investors use this information to model expected future results.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_45-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The problem is that forecasting is very subjective, relies on the company management team’s expectations and disclosures,&nbsp;and can be in some ways a self-fulfilling prophecy.&nbsp;\\\"Garbage in, garbage out\\\" is a term often used in conjunction with the modeling associated with fundamental analysis' intrinsic value determination.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_47-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> On the other hand, critics of <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/102914/technical-analysis-strategies-beginners.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">technical analysis think that</a> chart patterns work until they fail, and the failure of the pattern may not always be predictable from following the past pattern, especially if there is an unforeseen shock.\\n</p><p>Popular technical analysis indicators include relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and stochastic oscillator.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_50-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> One way to curtail the shortcomings of the two methods is to use them together to capture the best aspects of both. Fundamental analysis should be used to determine which stocks or sectors are most likely to perform well based on a strong macroeconomic environment and company or sector-specific operations.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_52-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Technical analysis can then be used to decide when to buy or sell by giving entry and exit points based on moving averages, volume, and <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/logvslinear.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">price trends</a>.&nbsp; By employing both strategies together, positions can be taken in fundamentally strong companies while avoiding buying into stocks that have already run up and are overvalued.&nbsp;\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_54-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Technical analysis can help you avoid buying high or selling low, a phenomenon that often occurs when psychology starts to rule trading.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_56-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Fundamental and technical analysis does not have to be contrary or held within bounds. At times there may be a single indicator that provides information for both the technician and fundamentalist.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_58-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> For example, price volatility is an important technical indicator of risk—the greater the volatility, the greater the risk. This may be a leading indicator that the fundamentals are changing.&nbsp;As a result, both would agree on the buy/sell decision.\\n</p><p>Technical analysis is a form of investment analysis that utilizes price data and chart patterns to help traders determine entry and exit points for making trades. Technical analysis focuses primarily on price movements rather than the financial condition of a company and is best suited for short-term traders seeking to take advantage of price changes. There are various technical indicators that traders employ to help them make trading decisions, such as the Aroon indicator and stochastic oscillators.</p><p>The best way to perform fundamental analysis is to understand a company's financial statements. Read over and understand its balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. This will provide guidance on a company's liquidity, debt profile, and profitability. From there, use financial metrics to help make sense of the numbers. Common financial metrics include earnings per share (EPS), revenue growth, profit margin, and return on equity (ROE).</p><p>From there, look outside of the company, for example how the industry it is in is performing and how the overall economic conditions might affect the company. Qualitative factors, such as management experience and the business model, will also shed light on a company's financial condition.</p><p>Use fundamental analysis when trying to determine the intrinsic value of an investment, such as stocks. This allows you to understand the growth potential of the asset based on financial health and market conditions. It is ideally used for long-term investments where you're seeking capital appreciation. Technical analysis should be used when you're looking for short-term investments focused on price movements in volatile markets.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_67-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Sometimes investors like to pigeonhole themselves into one type of investment style, but being open to combining styles may provide the best opportunity to make the most profit.&nbsp;Technical and fundamental analyses do not have to be used alone&nbsp;but can be used together to draw a complete investment picture.&nbsp;\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_69-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Fundamentals may be used</a> to identify appropriate targets, while technicals can be used to make trading decisions.&nbsp;Together, these methods can generate a confluence of information that should provide&nbsp;a better investment opportunity than either used alone.\\n</p>\"}"}]}

It begins with taking the first baby step—learning how to read a stock chart. Understanding a stock chart is basic to stock investing.</p><p>A stock chart is a price chart of a particular stock of a company or an index, plotted across time. On the X-axis is the time frame (intra-day, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly) and on the Y-axis is the price of the stock. It also represents other pieces of information that you will need to get the full picture of how a particular stock is doing in the market.</p><p>To invest in stock markets without knowing how to read stock charts is like shooting in the dark. You need to ace the art of reading stock charts to</p><p></p><p>Source; Yahoo! Finance</p><p>You can start by looking up a particular stock, for example, ITC.</p><p>On the top left you will find the name of the company, its stock symbol (also called the Ticker), and the name of the exchange on which the share trades.</p><p>The stock chart gives you the option to study the movement of the stock price over time, ranging from intraday to weekly, monthly, yearly and multi-year data. &nbsp;Commonly, traders look for daily and intraday data to learn about price movements in the short term. Since stock markets are volatile, investors usually look at such charts to decide whether they want to buy a particular stock immediately or hold off for a few days. To spot trends in the long term, they look at monthly or yearly data.</p><p>On hovering the mouse over the ticker symbol, you will see critical data about the stock’s trading activity in the day, called the OHLC data.</p><p>For a daily stock chart, the net change in the stock price and percentage change is shown in green or red, depending on whether the price rose or fell from the previous trading day’s closing figure. So in the image, +0.10 is the gain in the stock price of ITC from the previous day’s closing, and +0.04% is the percentage gain.</p><p>You can find the primary information plotted in the form of a line (generally the plotting line indicates only the closing price), a bar chart (plotting the OHLC data for each day) or candle and stick charts.</p><p></p><p>Line chart (Source: Yahoo!Finance)</p><p></p><p>Chart with candles and sticks (Source: Yahoo! Finance)</p><p>A candle and stick chart gives you a glimpse of how much the prices moved each day. In this type chart (shown above), the candles represent the range (closing and opening) &nbsp;of price movement in the day. So if the candle body is long, you know there has been significant price movement, and if the candle is shorter, it shows the prices have moved in a tighter range. &nbsp;The green candles show that the closing price of the stock was higher than its opening price, a net gain in stock price. A red candle signifies a net drop in the stock price from the opening.</p><p>Another vital data point is volume. In a simple daily stock chart, you can find trade volumes by hovering the mouse on a particular trading day.</p><p>In a daily chart, the volume is the number of share units of the stock traded. It reflects the demand for the stock at a particular price point. If trades are less, then it means there isn’t much interest to buy or sell the stock at the said price point. If trade volumes are high, it indicates active participation of buyers and sellers.</p><p>You have to read price movement in the context of the change in volume. They both go together, in understanding a stock chart. If there is a considerable price change, before acting on it, you must look at the volume. It may be that the price change is due to an anomaly or a one-off factor and not due to aggressive buying and selling. But if the price change is accompanied by a significant increase or decrease in volume, then it gives you a more realistic picture of actual buying or selling of shares by large investors.</p><p>For example, let’s assume there is a 3% drop or 3% gain in the price of a stock from the previous day. This information alone may get you jittery. But if you see the trading volume has been below average, then you know it is a one-off change and that the big investors are still sitting out.</p><p>Those trying to learn how to read stock market charts may wonder what the blue line is all about. The blue trend line in the image above, full of crests and troughs, shows the real price movement over time. When you notice particular sustainable trends in the price movements of a company’s stock, you must dig deeper to know if there were specific events or news triggers to explain the shift. The developments could be company-centric, economy centric, due to global macroeconomic factors, or broadly reflective of a bearish (subdued sentiment) or bullish (upbeat) market, among other essential triggers. This will help you make a calculated decision on buying or selling the stock.</p><p>To know how to read technical charts, you can also select technical indicators like the moving average lines by clicking on ‘indicators’. The moving average lines tell you how the closing prices averaged over time, like a 50 Day or 100 Day moving average.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Source- Yahoo! Finance</p><p>Stock charts are a great visual tool for you to see the support and resistance levels for the stock price. Generally, you will see, even though the stock prices have moved up and down, they may follow a price band within which they are moving or find support. On the higher end, you will find, stock prices do not breach past a certain price level for some time before a vital event trigger pushes the stock prices to breach those resistance levels. On the lower end, the stock prices find support at some level. The stock prices may touch the support levels multiple times before falling below those levels due to some critical event or cause.</p><p>For example, in the above chart, the ITC stock prices found support at 245.95 and resistance at 240 in August-September 2019.</p><p>In a nutshell, you could say, a stock chart at its very basic is a visual presentation of the demand and supply of a stock in the market represented through price movement over time. &nbsp;When you have learned how to read a stock chart well, you can play around with the various technical indicators to spot trends, buying and selling patterns, both a worm-eye and hawk-eye view of the market sentiment in the stock market. This will help you make well-informed forecasts about stock performance and pick the winning bets.</p><p class=\\\"happy-customers\\\">Join our 3 Cr+ happy customers</p><p class=\\\"main-text\\\">Open Free Demat Account!</p><p class=\\\"counter-text\\\">Join our 3 Cr+ happy customers</p><p class=\\\"zero-brokerage\\\">₹0 brokerage for first 30 days*</p><p class=\\\"happy-customers\\\">Join our 3 Cr+ happy customers</p><p class=\\\"heading-title uppercase   text-center\\\">Enjoy Free Equity Delivery for Lifetime</p><p class=\\\"lead text-center\\\">Open 100% free* demat &amp; trading A/C now!</p><p class=\\\"heading\\\">Minimal Brokerage Charges</p><p class=\\\"subheading\\\">₹0 brokerage on stock investments and flat ₹0 AMC for first year.</p><p class=\\\"heading\\\">ARQ Prime</p><p class=\\\"subheading\\\">Make smart decisions with ARQ prime, a rule based investment engine</p><p class=\\\"heading\\\">Technology Enabled</p><p class=\\\"subheading\\\">Trade or invest anywhere, anytime with our App or web platforms</p><p>By proceeding, I agree to <a href=\\\"/disclaimer\\\">T&amp;C</a> and <a href=\\\"/ppc/privacy-policy\\\">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p>Do you already have an account? <a href=\\\"https://angelone.in/trade/?utm_source=web&amp;utm_medium=AngelOne&amp;utm_campaign=lead_popup\\\" data-gtm-dl-on=\\\"click\\\" data-gtm-dl-en=\\\"Popup_Lead_Form\\\" data-gtm-dl-ec=\\\"Popup Lead Form\\\" data-gtm-dl-ea=\\\"Login\\\">Login</a></p><p><span style=\\\"color: #4db6f2;\\\">Copyright - All rights reserved</span></p><p>We collect, retain, and use your contact information for legitimate business purposes only, to contact you and to provide you information &amp; latest updates regarding our products &amp; services.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe do not sell or rent your contact information to third parties.</p><p> Please note that by submitting the above mentioned details, you are authorizing us to Call/SMS you even though you may be registered under DND.

However, the investment world might appear intimidating and complicated for those who are just starting. In this guide for beginners, we will provide you with a clear path to begin your journey toward generating wealth by breaking down the principles of investment planning and giving you essential information. Regardless of whether you are just beginning your professional life or have been saving for some time, this guide will assist you in gaining an understanding of the fundamentals of investment planning and will put you on the path to accomplishing your monetary objectives.</p><p>It's time to make an investment plan once you understand the basics of investment options and how to handle risk. Here is a step-by-step plan to help you begin:</p><p>Establishing financial goals is analogous to constructing a solid base for your future financial situation. The acquisition of riches and the maintenance of a course that leads to monetary success are not the only benefits of this endeavour; it also gives one a feeling of direction and purpose in life. Consider it a road map leading you to achieve&nbsp; your financial goals. Your financial goals should be specific to you. They could include anything from putting money aside for a down payment on a house to launching a business or simply establishing an emergency fund from the ground up.&nbsp;</p><p>If you set explicit and quantifiable goals, you will acquire the motivation and inspiration necessary to take action and turn your aspirations into a reality. You will acquire a revitalised sense of self-assurance and momentum with each new milestone you accomplish and each dollar you save, enabling you to continue moving toward your ultimate financial objective.</p><p>You need to clearly understand how you spend your money before you can begin serious preparations for the future. There is no point in beginning the budget planning process until you clearly understand where the money is coming from and where it is going; therefore, the first step is to collect this information. First and foremost, you should be concerned with gathering the data. Let's get started on gathering the information so that you can get a better idea of where you are. When you become aware of where your money is being spent, you will frequently find that adjustments come about independently. You can outline your many expenditure categories after a few months' worth of data. This will allow you to determine how you want to proceed.</p><p>The foundation of any sound financial plan is setting aside funds for unexpected expenditures. It is possible to begin with a small amount; a sum of $500 is sufficient to handle minor emergencies and repairs, preventing an unexpected expenditure from accumulating credit card debt. Your next objective might be to save $1,000, followed by one month's worth of essential living expenditures, and so on.</p><p>Another method of shockproofing your budget is to work on building your credit. When you have good credit, you have alternatives available to you when you need them, such as obtaining a low interest rate on a car loan. In addition, it can help you save money by lowering the premiums you pay for insurance, allowing you to avoid making deposits on utilities.</p><p>Taking care of your future requirements and planning for the well-being of your loved ones are both essential components of personal financial planning. Assuring that your assets are divided according to your preferences can be facilitated by creating a will. In addition, other types of estate planning paperwork can give your relatives clarity regarding how you would like to be cared for and the individuals who should be in charge of managing your affairs.&nbsp;</p><p>When you are just beginning to plan for your financial future, it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that the only way to achieve a balanced budget is to reduce the amount of money you spend. You may need to make sacrifices in certain areas to accomplish what you have set out to do. However, raising income is just as vital (and possibly more successful) as cutting spending, so don't forget that aspect of the budget!</p><p>When you see a financial advisor, they will make it a point to inquire about whether or not you have a retirement plan sponsored by your employer, such as a 401(k), and whether or not your employer matches any portion of your contribution. Contributions to your 401(k) will reduce the money you take home now; nonetheless, it is worthwhile to consider contributing enough to receive the full matching amount. It is a match that is free money.&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose you have a 401(k), 403(b), or . In that case, in another comparable plan, it is also generally recommended by financial counsellors that you progressively increase the amount of money you contribute toward the limit set by the IRS. In 2024, $23,000 (or $30,500 for those who are 50 years old or older)&nbsp;</p><p>One such method of accumulating money for retirement planning is through an individual retirement arrangement, sometimes known as an IRA. Additional savings for retirement can be accumulated through the use of these tax-favored investment accounts. In 2024, the maximum contribution amount is $7,000, or $8,000, for individuals 50 years of age or older.&nbsp;</p><p>The moment has come to begin investing once you comprehensively understand your financial objectives, budget, emergency fund, and the various investment opportunities available. You can utilise automated investment systems known as robo-advisors and open investment accounts such as brokerage accounts, retirement accounts (such as 401(k) or IRA), or open investment accounts. Your asset allocation plan and level of comfort with risk should be considered when choosing certain investments. Additionally, it is essential to perform regular reviews and rebalance your portfolio to keep the asset allocation that you have chosen.</p><p>The ability to plan investments is a skill that is necessary for anyone who wants to ensure their financial future and accomplish their financial objectives. You can construct a route to financial success by establishing particular objectives, developing a financial plan, determining the level of risk you are willing to take, diversifying your portfolio, and keeping a close eye on your investments consistently. Keeping in mind that investing is a long-term endeavour, patience is essential. Building wealth and obtaining the financial freedom and security you desire can be accomplished by applying smart financial principles and the determination to reach these goals.</p><p>It is never too early to get started when working with a financial planner. You are not required to be affluent to reap the benefits of wealth management services; you may start this journey at any point in your life. Recommendations are a common way for consumers to find their financial planner. Ask your relatives and friends if they know someone who can be trusted. Additionally, you can use a website to find out what other people have to say about the planner you are considering using. If you need assistance with financial planning, The Kalculators may be able to provide it. We provide a range of services, some of which include tax planning, asset management, and other related services. To meet with a financial planner, please contact us immediately.</p><p>To start with financial planning, you don't need much money! Even though you are beginning with a relatively modest sum, the most important thing is establishing the routine of budgeting, saving, and investing as soon as possible. Keep in mind that every dollar is critical!</p><p>Even though it is not required, working with a financial advisor can bring very helpful insights and expertise, particularly as the complexity of your financial situation increases. On the other hand, many novices can begin their journey toward a solid understanding of the fundamentals of financial planning by beginning with internet resources, books, and budgeting apps.</p><p>Creating a budget includes:</p><p>If you want to stick to it, you should aim to set reasonable spending limits, refrain from impulse purchasing, and review your budget regularly to adapt it to changes.</p><p>Saving money is analogous to putting money aside for short-term objectives or unexpected expenses, typically in low-risk accounts such as savings accounts. On the other hand, investing is the process of placing money into assets such as stocks, bonds, or real estate with the hope of generating returns over time but with a higher level of risk.</p><p>A good rule of thumb is to set aside at least 10–15 percent of your income for retirement. Still, the precise amount relies on several factors, including your age, your lifestyle goals, and the expenses you anticipate incurring during your retirement years. Your savings can greatly increase if you begin their accumulation early and make consistent contributions to retirement accounts.</p><p>To avoid typical errors, it is important to avoid taking on excessive debt, overspending, neglecting emergency money, and not diversifying investments. In addition, it is essential to maintain a high level of knowledge, refrain from making emotional choices regarding your finances, and routinely examine your financial plan to make any necessary improvements.</p><p class=\\\"blog-sidebar-author-short-description\\\">Kaleem is CEO &amp; Author at \\\"The Kalculators\\\".

But with a few simple tips, you can start saving and spending wisely. These 10 easy steps will help you take control of your money and set you on the path to a secure future.\\n</p><p>Starting as a young adult and managing your money upon that can feel like a big challenge. With so many expenses and financial decisions to make, it’s easy to feel lost. But don’t worry, getting your finances on track doesn’t have to be complicated. By following a few simple and smart tips, you can start saving, budgeting, and making better money choices. Whether it’s learning how to build an emergency fund or understanding the importance of tracking your spending. In this article, the top 10 financial tips will help you step by step to create a solid foundation for a secure future.</p><p><em>Photos source: Pixabay/Representational</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Setting life goals is like creating a map for your journey. It gives you direction and helps you focus on what’s most important to you, like buying a house, traveling, or saving for the future. By having clear goals, you can make better choices with your money and stay motivated to work towards them.&nbsp;</p><p>Start by writing down what you want to achieve and break it into smaller steps. This way, you’ll know exactly what you’re working toward and how to get there. It’s the first step toward financial success and building a secure future.</p><p>Making a monthly budget is one of the best ways to take control of your money. Start by listing all your sources of income, such as your salary or allowance. Then, write down your regular expenses, like rent, groceries, bills, and transportation. After that, allot a certain amount for savings and any personal expenses, like entertainment or shopping. Be realistic with your spending and try not to exceed your income. Regularly track your expenses throughout the month to ensure you’re staying on budget. This simple plan will help you avoid overspending and start saving for your goals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An emergency fund is like a financial safety net for unexpected situations, such as medical bills, car repairs, or job loss. Start by saving a small amount each month, even if it’s just a few hundred rupees. Aim to build at least 3 to 6 months' worth of essential expenses, like rent, groceries, and bills. Keep this money in a separate savings account where it’s easily accessible but not tempting to spend. Treat your emergency fund as a priority, and avoid using it for non-emergencies. A well-prepared fund will give you peace of mind and protect you from financial stress.</p><p>Starting early with investments is one of the smartest financial decisions you can make. The earlier you begin, the more time your money has to grow through the power of compounding. Even small amounts invested regularly can build significant wealth over time. Start by setting clear goals and exploring options like mutual funds, SIPs, or stocks that suit your risk factor. Focus on long-term growth rather than quick gains, and don’t forget to diversify your investments.&nbsp;</p><p>Using a credit card can be convenient, but it requires careful handling. Always spend within your limit and pay the full balance on time to avoid interest charges. Avoid using it for unnecessary expenses or withdrawing cash, as it comes with high fees. Keep track of your spending to ensure it doesn’t exceed your budget. Choose a card that offers rewards or benefits that suit your needs, like cashback or discounts. Most importantly, avoid falling into a debt trap by using credit cards only when necessary. Responsible use can help you build a good credit score and financial discipline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Retirement planning is about ensuring you have enough money to live comfortably when you stop working. Start by calculating how much you’ll need for your post-retirement years, considering expenses like housing, healthcare, and daily needs. Begin saving early to take advantage of compounding, even if it’s a small amount. Explore retirement-specific investment options like pension plans, EPF, or NPS. Regularly review your progress and adjust your savings as your income grows.&nbsp;</p><p>Health and life insurance are important for protecting yourself and your family from unexpected financial burdens. Health insurance covers medical expenses, ensuring you don’t have to dip into your savings for hospital bills, treatments, or emergencies. Life insurance provides financial support to your family in case of your untimely demise, helping them manage expenses like loans, education, or daily needs. Choose a health plan that suits your medical needs and a life insurance policy with adequate coverage based on your income and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tax planning is a smart way to reduce your tax burden while ensuring compliance with tax laws. It involves organising your finances to take advantage of deductions, exemptions, and tax-saving investments. Start by understanding the tax brackets and benefits available under sections like 80C, 80D, or 10(10D). Consider investments in options like ELSS, PPF, NPS, or tax-saving fixed deposits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Avoiding unnecessary expenses is a better way to manage your money wisely. Start by distinguishing between needs and wants, and prioritise essential items like bills, groceries, and savings over impulsive purchases. Create a budget and stick to it, tracking where your money goes every month. Avoid buying things just because they’re on sale, and think twice before spending on luxury items. Small changes, like eating out less or canceling unused.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\\\"cookiePara\\\">By accepting cookies, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.</p>\"}"}]}

Check out this post to know six simple tips that can help you set concrete financial goals.</p><p>There is a widespread myth in India that&nbsp;<a href=\\\"/privilege-banking/personal/the-early-days\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">financial planning</a> and setting financial goals are only for people in a particular age or income bracket. Every individual aiming to live a financially secure life needs to set well-defined, concrete goals and work towards them from an early age to be better prepared to achieve them.</p><p>But while we all want to achieve a lot to different things in life, how to set financial goals correctly is something that most people don't know about. Here are six tips that can help you set goals for your future:</p><p>It is essential to know where you currently are to understand where you want to go. When it comes to <a href=\\\"/blogs/investment/investing-for-life-goals\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">goal planning</a>, this means creating a budget. When you create a budget for your monthly expenses, you will see how much money is getting slipped through the cracks every month. This will allow you to know the areas where you can save money. This money can be put to good use to help you get closer to your objectives.</p><p>Once you know your monthly expenses, the next step is to understand your financial goals. Know what matters to you and what type of life you would like to live in the future. For most people, the common financial objectives are buying a car, a new home, savings for a child's education and marriage, and retirement planning.</p><p>Once you know your goals, prioritise them in the order in which you would like to achieve them. This will enable you to work out a plan specific to goals.</p><p>After prioritising your objectives, categorise them in short-term, medium-term and long-term goals. With the rising cost of living, saving is not adequate anymore. You need to save and invest your money if you want to meet your objectives successfully.</p><p>Categorising the goals will help you select investment options that best suit a particular time frame. You can also break down the objectives into smaller mini-goals to further strengthen your goal planning.</p><p>If you want to be a smart financial goal planner, create a separate bank account solely for depositing your savings and investing after the goals are categorised and prioritised. Even if you are not able to save a lot of money currently, start with a small amount.</p><p>If possible, try to automate deposits of a fixed amount every month into this account, so that you do not have to test your memory and willpower to stay on track. You can also create an emergency fund for managing your emergency expenses, so that you don’t have to withdraw money from this Savings Account.</p><p>You will often come across experts suggesting people to select investment options as per their personal profile. This means that you should select an investment that is in line with your objectives, time frame, age, risk appetite and investment style.</p><p>If you are confused with all the different types of investment options, you can also consider taking professional help. Now there are online personal finance management platforms also that can guide you on your financial health and help you achieve your objectives.</p><p>After investing, it is also essential to regularly check the progress to make sure that you stay on track. Utilise your funds in the best way possible and make changes to your portfolio only when required.</p><p>Most investment options take time to deliver considerable returns. As long as you have selected a reliable instrument, be patient and give some time to the investment to deliver returns.</p><p>Many people, especially salaried employees, are now getting financially aware and understanding the importance of saving and investing.</p><p>If you want to set financial objectives that are well-defined and concrete, follow the above steps and be rest assured that the results would be outstanding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>DISCLAIMER</i></p><p><i>The contents of this document are meant merely for information purposes.

Limited income and growing obligations force individuals to stick to fixed deposits, which offer security but meagre returns. However, the landscape is shifting. The search for more rewarding yet secure options is becoming more urgent. This blog will guide you through 10 alternatives to fixed deposits that could provide a more favourable balance between safety and financial growth.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">It is an investment tool where you place a specific amount of money with a financial institution, for a designated duration. The return on this deposit is determined at the outset and does not fluctuate during the investment period. Durations can vary widely from a week to several years based on individual preference.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">Investors can choose to have the interest credited periodically or reinvested until the end of the term. Compared to regular savings accounts, FDs typically offer more favourable returns, appealing to those who prefer low-risk, predictable outcomes. Once the term concludes, the initial sum, along with the accumulated interest, is returned to you.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">Though FDs provide a sense of security, they have certain constraints that may hinder your financial progress. Before sticking with this traditional choice, it is important to recognise the risks involved. Considering these factors may prompt you to explore better alternatives to FD.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\"><strong>1. Limited Access To Your Money</strong></span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">A fixed deposit offers limited access to your money that is locked up until maturity. The maturity period of a fixed deposit may range from months to years. The withdrawal of your deposit prior to the maturity date invites a reduced interest rate or a hefty fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\"><strong>2. Lower Returns</strong></span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">Even though a fixed deposit offers a higher interest rate than your savings account, it is still very low compared to other investment assets available in the market. Today, a maximum of 6-7% annual interest rate is offered by a few Indian banks for deposits below two crores.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\"><strong>3. A Weak Shield Against Inflation&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">While fixed deposits offer greater protection for your capital but with lower returns, they fail to shield your capital against another impending risk: inflation. Suppose the inflation rate in India stands at 6%, a fixed deposit scheme that offers a 6% interest is like parking your hard-earned money with no investment return at all!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\"><strong>4. A Boring Investment Venture</strong></span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">While today’s market offers a wide array of exotic investment assets with greater returns, fixed deposits stand as a safer yet boring investment that has very little investment return to offer. If you are looking for active participation in the investment world, a fixed deposit is probably not a suitable investment asset for you.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">Today, we have got some great alternatives to FD that could offer better returns. Let us take a look at some of them.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><a rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https://www.gripinvest.in/blog/nsc-national-savings-certificate\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#1155cc;\\\">NSC</span></a><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\"> is a secure investment option offered by the government, accessible through post offices and some banks. It has a five-year lock-in period, with the current (September-2024) annual interest rate set at 7.7%, compounded yearly and paid upon maturity<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">NSC allows you to claim deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, reducing your taxable income by up to INR 1.5 lakhs. Instead of being paid out, the interest accumulates over the term, making it suitable for long-term goals. Additionally, NSC can be pledged to obtain loans, providing an extra layer of utility.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><a rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https://www.gripinvest.in/blog/types-of-lease\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#1155cc;\\\">Lease investment</span></a><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\"> is a unique option for those looking to move beyond FDs. It involves purchasing a property and leasing it to a tenant, often for extended periods, generating regular revenue.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">What sets lease investment apart is its relatively low risk. The tenant usually handles expenses like maintenance and taxes, which reduces the financial burden on the property owner. Many agreements also include provisions for gradual rent increases, offering a buffer against inflation. This type of investment not only ensures a stable income but also provides a measure of protection against rising costs, making it a valuable addition to a diversified portfolio.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">PPF is one of the popular long-term investment vehicles with government backing. You can start with a deposit as low as INR 500, while the maximum you can contribute annually is INR 1.5 lakhs. The fund has a maturity period of 15 years, and if you wish, you can extend this in blocks of five years.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">The current return on PPF, set at 7.1% (till September 30-2024), is periodically revised by the government<sup>2</sup>. A significant advantage is its favourable tax treatment. Investments are eligible for deductions under Section 80C. Although the fund has a lengthy lock-in period, partial access to your funds is allowed after seven years, promoting disciplined financial planning for long-term goals.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">These include instruments like Treasury Bills (T-Bills), which cater to short-term needs, and government bonds, designed for extended investment periods. T-Bills are available with maturities– 91, 182 or 364 days - and are bought at a discount, with no periodic payouts, making them ideal for short-term financial strategies.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">In contrast,&nbsp;</span><a rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https://www.gripinvest.in/blog/government-bonds-vs-corporate-bonds\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#1155cc;\\\">government bonds</span></a><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">, which can last up to 40 years, deliver semi-annual interest, offering consistent returns throughout their term. Additionally, State Development Loans (SDLs), issued by state governments, offer a similar structure but with variable durations from 3 to 35 years.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">This range of government-backed securities appeals to those who seek a reliable, low-risk investment, allowing flexibility across both short and long-term financial objectives.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><a rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https://www.gripinvest.in/corporate-bonds\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#1155cc;\\\">Corporate bonds</span></a><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\"> can be a compelling option for those exploring alternatives to FD for better returns. These debt instruments allow companies to raise funds by borrowing from investors, who, in turn, receive interest payments over a specified term. Unlike equity investments, purchasing these bonds makes you a lender to the company rather than a part-owner.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">An advantage of the bonds is the steady income they provide through regular interest payouts. Each bond comes with a set maturity date making them useful for planning specific financial goals. The creditworthiness of the issuing company is reflected in the bond’s credit rating helping investors understand the associated risk. However while they often yield better returns than FDs, corporate bonds do carry risks like market volatility and inflation.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">Corporate bonds offer a structured way to earn steady returns while balancing risk and reward. If you're looking for options that provide competitive yields with varying risk levels, consider exploring fixed-income opportunities.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">These funds put your money into avenues like government securities, corporate loans, and treasury bills. They tend to be more stable than stocks. You can choose from options like liquid, short-duration, or gilt funds, each with a specific purpose.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">A major advantage is that you can access your money when needed, without facing large penalties. This makes these funds a smart choice if you want both reliable returns and some flexibility.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">These FDs are issued by Non-Banking Financial Companies or the NBFCs and other firms. The deposits tend to offer more attractive interest rates. One significant difference from bank FDs is the lack of insurance protection. Corporate deposits are not covered by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), so if the issuer encounters financial trouble, your investment may be at risk.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">Evaluating the credit ratings of these deposits is essential, as they indicate the stability of the issuing entity. High ratings like AAA suggest a safer investment, while lower ratings could imply greater uncertainty. Investors considering corporate FDs should weigh the potential rewards against the risks, and conduct thorough research into the issuing entity’s financial health before making a commitment.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">RDs offer a structured way to accumulate wealth over time. Instead of investing a lump sum, you make regular, fixed contributions each month for a specified period contributing to monthly income.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">With flexible terms, RDs lock in the interest rate at the start, ensuring consistent returns. The interest is compounded periodically, and at the end of the term, you receive the total of your deposits plus the interest earned.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">This option is particularly beneficial for those who prefer gradual savings rather than a one-time investment. However, accessing the funds before the end of the term is generally discouraged and might incur penalties. RDs are suitable for individuals aiming to build their savings steadily with the assurance of fixed returns.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">These bonds offer a secure investment option with a dynamic interest rate. Adjusted every six months, the rate is tied to the NSC plus an additional 0.35%, with interest paid out twice a year<sup>3</sup>.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">These bonds have a tenure of seven years, making them suitable for medium-term financial planning. Though they cannot be traded or transferred, they provide stability with returns that adapt to inflation trends. The interest, while taxable, ensures a consistent income, offering a safe haven for those wary of market volatility.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">FMP are structured as closed-ended debt mutual funds, providing a time-bound investment strategy different from traditional FDs. These funds have a set duration, during which your capital is invested in assets like corporate bonds or government securities that mature alongside the plan.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">One of the distinct features of FMPs is their ability to offer relatively predictable outcomes. By aligning the fund's term with the maturity dates of its investments, you can gauge your potential returns at the start.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">However, FMPs require a commitment, as the funds cannot be accessed before the end of the term unless sold on the stock exchange, which carries its own risks. This makes them a suitable choice for those looking to achieve specific financial goals within a defined timeline, combining steady growth with tax efficiency.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">Considering various options beyond FDs can lead to more tailored outcomes, whether you are seeking higher yields, greater liquidity, or tax advantages. Every investment avenue presents unique benefits and challenges. By carefully assessing how each fits into your overall financial plan, you can select the most suitable path for your objectives.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">Stay informed and discover top investment opportunities by exploring&nbsp;</span><a rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" href=\\\"https://www.gripinvest.in/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#1155cc;\\\"><u>Grip Invest</u></span></a><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\"> today!</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\"><strong>References:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\\\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\\\">1.

But bear in mind that stocks are also riskier than bonds, so as the percentage of stocks in your portfolio grows, so does your risk.

When dollar-cost averaging, you invest the same amount at regular intervals and by doing so, hopefully lower your average purchase price. You will already be in the market when prices drop and when they rise. For instance, you'll have exposure to dips when they happen and don't have to try to time them. By investing a fixed amount regularly, you will end up buying more shares when the price is lower than when it is higher.</p><p>The key advantage of dollar-cost averaging is that it reduces the negative effects of investor psychology and market timing on a portfolio. By committing to a dollar-cost averaging approach, investors avoid the risk that they will make counter-productive decisions out of greed or fear, such as buying more when prices are rising or panic-selling when prices decline. Instead, dollar-cost averaging forces investors to focus on contributing a set amount of money each period while ignoring the price of the target security.</p><p>With regard to actually using the strategy, how often you use it may depend on your investment horizon, outlook on the market, and experience with investing. If your outlook is for a market in flux that will eventually rise, then you might try it. If a persistent bear market's at work, then it wouldn't be a smart strategy to use. If you're planning to use it for long-term investing and wonder what interval for buying makes sense, consider applying some of every paycheck to the regular purchases.</p><p>Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. \\\"<a href=\\\"https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/dollar-cost-averaging\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"externalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">The Pros and Cons of Dollar-Cost Averaging</a>.\\\"</p>\"}"}]}

Mutual funds are often actively managed, with fund managers making investment decisions to outperform the market. However, passive mutual funds, like index funds, are gaining traction due to their cost-effectiveness. In contrast, ETFs are typically passive investments that replicate market indices or sector-specific benchmarks. The key distinction lies in trading flexibility: mutual funds are priced and traded only at the end of the trading day, whereas ETFs are traded on stock exchanges throughout the day, much like individual stocks. This intraday trading capability offers investors greater flexibility in responding to market fluctuations. Additionally, ETFs often feature lower expense ratios compared to actively managed mutual funds, making them an attractive choice for cost-conscious investors. Both options cater to different investment strategies and objectives, offering diverse opportunities for portfolio diversification.</p><p>In this article, we’ll explore the key differences between Mutual Funds and ETFs, helping you understand how each investment option works and which might be the better choice for you in 2024. We'll cover the pros and cons of each, considering factors like cost, flexibility, and performance, so you can make an informed decision in today’s dynamic market.</p><p>Mutual funds are professionally managed investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets such as stocks, bonds, or other securities. Managed by experienced fund managers, mutual funds aim to achieve specific financial objectives, such as income generation, capital appreciation, or a balance of both. They cater to varying investor goals and risk appetites, offering options like equity funds, debt funds, hybrid funds, and more.</p><p>Investors purchase units of a mutual fund at the fund’s net asset value (NAV), which reflects the value of the underlying assets after deducting expenses. Mutual funds are priced only once daily, at the end of the trading day, and transactions are processed accordingly.</p><p>Mutual funds provide benefits like professional management, diversification, and ease of investment, making them accessible to both novice and seasoned investors. They can be actively managed, where fund managers make strategic decisions, or passively managed, tracking an index with minimal intervention. While mutual funds offer convenience and growth potential, they come with risks tied to market performance, making it essential for investors to align their choices with their financial goals and risk tolerance.</p><p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment instruments that combine the features of stocks and mutual funds. They are designed to track the performance of a specific index, sector, commodity, or asset class, allowing investors to gain broad market exposure through a single transaction. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are traded on stock exchanges throughout the trading day, similar to individual stocks.</p><p>The price of an ETF fluctuates based on supply and demand, and it may differ slightly from its net asset value (NAV). ETFs typically feature lower expense ratios than actively managed funds, making them cost-efficient options for long-term investors. They are generally passively managed, aiming to replicate the performance of the underlying index rather than outperform it.</p><p>ETFs provide flexibility, liquidity, and diversification. Investors can buy and sell ETF units at market prices during trading hours, enabling them to capitalise on intraday price movements. Additionally, ETFs suit various investment strategies, including long-term growth, income generation, or hedging against market risks. While ETFs offer several advantages, including transparency and tax efficiency, they are subject to market volatility and tracking errors. Thus, investors should carefully evaluate their financial goals and risk tolerance before investing in ETFs.</p><p>When it comes to investment opportunities,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"/investments/mutual-funds\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">mutual funds</a> and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) stand as two prominent options, each offering unique benefits. While both provide exposure to a diversified portfolio of securities, their operational mechanisms and management styles differ. Understanding these differences can help investors make informed decisions based on their financial goals and risk tolerance.</p><p>Here are five key points to consider when comparing ETFs and mutual funds:</p><p>When considering the differences between ETF and mutual funds, investors encounter distinct characteristics that shape their investment choices. ETFs trade on stock exchanges like any other stock, providing high liquidity, while mutual funds are transacted at the end of the day at the NAV price, impacting their liquidity.

For instance, if an investor requests redemption before the cut-off time, the sale will be executed at the day's closing NAV. Conversely, ETFs allow real-time redemptions throughout the trading day, similar to stocks. For example, if an investor wishes to sell ETF shares at noon, the transaction occurs instantly at the current market price. Mutual funds offer a fixed end-of-day price, while ETFs provide flexibility with fluctuating intraday market prices.</p><p>Choosing between an ETF and a mutual fund depends on your investment goals and preferences. ETFs are ideal for those seeking flexibility, as they trade like stocks throughout the day and often have lower fees. They suit investors focused on passive, low-cost investing. Mutual funds, on the other hand, are better suited for those preferring professional fund management aimed at outperforming the market. They are traded based on the daily Net Asset Value (NAV) and may involve higher fees. Ultimately, your risk tolerance, <a href=\\\"/investments/investment-strategy\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">investment strategy</a>, and desire for hands-on management will guide your choice.</p><p>ETFs are not inherently riskier than mutual funds; the level of risk depends on the underlying assets and the investor’s strategy. Both investment types are subject to market risks, such as price volatility and economic downturns. However, ETFs can appear riskier due to their intraday trading nature, where prices fluctuate throughout the day based on market demand. This feature may lead to impulsive trading or losses for inexperienced investors.</p><p>Mutual funds, being priced once daily at net asset value (NAV), discourage frequent trading, which can be seen as a risk-mitigation feature. Additionally, actively managed mutual funds can adapt to market conditions, potentially reducing risk. Conversely, ETFs generally track an index passively, which might not account for changing market dynamics.</p><p>Ultimately, the risk profile of ETFs and mutual funds depends on the underlying investments. Investors should assess their financial goals, risk tolerance, and market understanding before investing.</p><p>Understanding these differences is crucial for optimizing investment strategies.</p><p>During investing, ETFs and mutual funds stand out as popular choices, each offering unique advantages and considerations. While ETFs provide liquidity, lower expense ratios, and tax efficiency, mutual funds offer active management and broader diversification. Understanding the differences between ETFs vs mutual funds is crucial for investors to align their investment strategies with their financial goals and risk tolerance levels.

These passive investments, long considered an unimaginative way to invest, are behind a quiet revolution in U.S. equity markets, attracting a widening swath of investors. The numbers tell the story: Passive index funds tracking market benchmarks accounted for just 21% of the U.S. equity fund market in 2012.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"25\\\"></span> By 2023, passive index funds had grown to about half of all U.S. fund assets.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"26\\\"></span>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_3-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <a href=\\\"https://styledwealth.com/about/#AboutAutumn\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"externalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Autumn Knutson</a>, founder and lead financial planner at Styled Wealth and an <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/inv-100-top-financial-advisors-7556227\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\">Investopedia top-100 financial advisor</a>, said there are good reasons why. \\\"Index funds are a low-cost way to track a specific group of investments, which can be more broadly diversified than individual stocks and simpler to buy than each of the individual holdings within the index,\\\" she said. \\\"They are very popular for people looking to invest in a group of investments in a simple and cost-effective way.\\\"\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_5-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The seismic shift in the rise of passive funds has come as they often convincingly outperform their actively managed peers.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"1\\\"></span><span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"26\\\"></span> According to the widely followed S&amp;P Indices Versus Active (SPIVA) scorecards, about 9 out of 10 actively managed funds didn't match the returns of the S&amp;P 500 benchmark in the past 15 years.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"1\\\"></span>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_8-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Given this, critics argue that managers of actively traded funds have extracted higher fees for themselves while returning less to clients. Below, we unpack what index funds are and how they work. And we'll discuss the benefits and drawbacks of building a portfolio with index funds.\\n</p><p>Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_12-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Indexes and index funds exist for almost any part of the financial market. Index funds invest in the same assets using the same weights as the target index, typically stocks or bonds. If you're interested in the stocks of an economic sector or the whole market, you can find indexes that aim to gain returns that closely match the benchmark index you want to track. Index funds use a <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveinvesting.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">passive investing</a> strategy, trading as little as possible to keep costs low.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_14-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> For broad indexes like the <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">S&amp;P 500</a>, it would be impractical or expensive to put in the right proportions on your own. Index funds do the work for you by holding a representative sample of the securities. S&amp;P 500 index funds, the most popular and oldest such funds in the U.S., mimic the moves of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500, which covers about 80% of all U.S. equities by market cap.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"20\\\"></span>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_18-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The portfolios of index funds only change substantially when their benchmark indexes change.

The broader index funds are often quite good at minimizing <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trackingerror.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">tracking errors</a>, the difference between the fund's performance and the target index.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_24-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> However, you'll want to review closely any fund's fees and performance before investing. To give an idea of how close the funds should track their targets, as of August 2024, Fidelity's Nasdaq Composite Index Fund (FNCMX) had a 10-year average annual return of 15.54% versus 15.57% for the Nasdaq composite, a 0.03% difference.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"23\\\"></span><br>\\n</p><p>Investing in index funds means putting your money not behind the skills of active fund managers but on the prospects of specific parts of the market.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_28-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> As Knutson noted, index funds are very popular among investors because they offer a simple, no-fuss way to gain exposure to a broad, diversified portfolio at a low cost for the investor. They are passively managed investments, and for this reason, they often have low expense ratios. In <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">bull markets</a>, these funds can provide attractive returns as the market rises, lifting all boats. They do come with disadvantages, however. One is the lack of downside protection; in prolonged downtrends, these funds can perform poorly in line with the broader market.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_30-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> For investors considering index funds, there are two main ways to do so:\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_34-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Investors in index funds can often benefit from professional guidance, despite index funds' reputation as a do-it-yourself investing solution, \\\"Advisors are able to help with compiling a portfolio of multiple index funds that track multiple markets, say a U.S. large-cap index fund, an international stock index fund, and perhaps a U.S. and International Bond Index Fund,\\\" Knutson said.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_36-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> This diversification strategy can help spread risk across different markets and asset classes. Knutson added that these portfolios should be \\\"monitored for rebalancing (to ensure no portion of those investments get over or underweight).\\\"\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_38-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The need for professional advice is more readily apparent when your finances are more complex. An advisor can be \\\"especially helpful if the account is taxable or if there are irregular contributions to an account,\\\" Knutson said. \\\"Otherwise, there could be tax efficiencies left on the table or the account could get more out of balance than preferred if there are no recurring contributions being put in to keep it rebalanced with each new contribution.\\\"<br>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_40-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> While index funds are, for many, a straightforward investing approach, they're not a one-size-fits-all solution, and thousands of choices are available. The decision to invest in index funds—and how to manage them as part of a wider portfolio—should be based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Whether you choose to go it alone or seek professional guidance, understanding the pros and cons of index fund investing is crucial to making informed investment decisions.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_43-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011316/pros-and-cons-indexes.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">The primary advantage</a> index funds have over their actively managed peers is lower fees. So, if actively managed funds don’t outperform their passive peers, more investors are asking, why are we paying fund managers so much more in fees each year? Using SPIVA data as a proxy, which compares the performance of actively managed funds with specific benchmarks, 79% of actively traded funds had underperformed the S&amp;P 500 the previous five years, according to data last published in mid-2024. When you extend that to 15 years, it's 88%.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"1\\\"></span>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_45-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> A greater public understanding of this kind of data helps explain the growing popularity of passive funds, almost all of which are index funds. You still have to pay an expense ratio with these funds, charged as a percentage of the assets under management to <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/121515/how-much-mutual-fund-managers-make.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">pay to advisors and managers</a> and cover transaction fees, taxes, and accounting costs.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"7\\\"></span>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_47-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Since the managers of index funds are simply replicating the performance of a benchmark index, they don't need research analysts and others to choose stocks, timing trades, etc. They also trade holdings less frequently, meaning fewer transaction fees and commissions. By contrast, actively managed funds have large staffs and conduct trades with more complications and volume, driving up costs.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_49-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> As such, index funds can charge less than their actively trading peers. They often cost as low as 0.04%—compared with the higher fees that actively managed funds command, typically 0.44% and sometimes higher than 1.00%, depending on the assets.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"24\\\"></span><span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"19\\\"></span>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_51-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Let's summarize the advantages:\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_55-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> These funds have many virtues that make them well-suited for ordinary long-term investors. That said, the best choice for you—active or passive—depends on your financial goals, the investment environment, <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">risk tolerance</a>, and other specifics about your situation.

This means they may invest in companies that are overvalued or fundamentally weak, leaving aside greater weighting of assets that could provide better returns. Of course, this automated strategy has often outperformed active management, perhaps in part by holding onto assets that active fund managers have misjudged.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"28\\\"></span>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_64-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Another disadvantage has to do with what's called <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationweightedindex.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">market-cap weighting</a>, which many index funds use. Companies with higher market capitalizations have a more significant influence on the fund's performance in such funds.

The fund that started it all, founded by Vanguard chair <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_bogle.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">John Bogle</a> in 1976, remains among the best as judged by its long-term performance and low cost. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has tracked the S&amp;P 500 faithfully in composition and performance. As of July 2024, <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102715/what-are-vanguards-admiral-shares.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\">Vanguard’s Admiral Shares (VFIAX)</a> had a 10-year average annual return of 13.11% vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 13.14%—a very small tracking error.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"27\\\"></span> The expense ratio is low at 0.04%, and its minimum investment is $3,000.\\n</p><p>Find out <em>Investopedia</em>'s <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Investopedia-10-Rules-Investing/dp/1547866918/\\\" data-component=\\\"amazon\\\" data-source=\\\"affiliate\\\" data-type=\\\"externalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">10 Rules of Investing</a> by ordering a copy of our special issue print edition.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_83-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Investing in index funds is straightforward for both new and experienced investors. Here’s how to get started investing in index funds:\\n</p><p>Index funds track portfolios composed of many stocks or bonds. As a result, investors benefit from the positive effects of <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">diversification</a>, such as increasing the expected return of the portfolio while minimizing the overall risk. While any individual stock may see its price drop steeply, if it's a relatively small part of a larger index, it won't be as damaging.</p><p>Many index funds have no minimum required to start investing. Index funds also generally have low annual fees, and these fees, on average, have been declining over the past several years. According to data from the Investment Company Institute in 2024, the average fee for an index fund is 0.05%, with some index funds offering even lower expense ratios. All else being equal, you might wish to choose the lower-cost fund among those that equally track the same index well.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"19\\\"></span></p><p>Index funds can be an excellent option for beginners stepping into the investment world. They are a simple, cost-effective way to hold a broad range of stocks or bonds that mimic a specific <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">benchmark</a> index, meaning they are diversified. Index funds have lower expense ratios than most actively managed funds, and they often outperform them, too. These reasons make them a solid choice not only for beginners but for many expert investors as well.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"1\\\"></span> A final bonus for newer investors: If your fund is tied to a leading index like the S&amp;P 500 or Nasdaq composite, you'll see news coverage often, helping you keep abreast of your investment while learning the broader market's ebbs and flows.</p><p>Index funds are generally safer than individual stocks because of their inherent diversification. They track a specific market index, such as the S&amp;P 500, which means they contain a broad range of stocks across various sectors. If a single company performs poorly, that hurts you if that's a big part of your portfolio. But if it's the S&amp;P 500 index, it's just one of hundreds in your index fund.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"29\\\"></span></p><p>The best index funds for retirement offer growth potential and solid risk management that aligns with your time to retirement and risk tolerance. For long-term growth, consider broad-market equity index funds like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) or the Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX). For diversification and income, bond index funds like the Fidelity Total Bond Fund (FTBFX) can be a good choice. <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/07/life_cycle.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Target-date retirement funds</a>, which automatically adjust their allocation as your retirement approaches, can also be a convenient option for retirement planning, though these are actively managed and invest in a range of indexes and other assets.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"30\\\"></span></p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_98-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Index funds are a popular choice for investors seeking low-cost, diversified, and passive investments that happen to outperform many higher-fee, actively traded funds. They are designed to replicate the performance of financial market indexes, like the S&amp;P 500, and are ideal for long-term investing, such as retirement accounts.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_100-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> While they offer advantages like lower risk through diversification and long-term solid returns, index funds are also subject to market swings and lack the flexibility of active management. Despite these limits, index funds are often favored for their consistent performance and are now a staple in many investment portfolios. Consider your investment objectives and risk tolerance when choosing an index fund.

After having topped out around $3 trillion in 2021 and falling in 2022, the total value of all these digital currencies now sits at about $3.3 trillion as of November 2024, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Of these, <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-bitcoin/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"Bitcoin\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"1\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">Bitcoin</a> is the most popular, worth more than $1.9 trillion itself. Investors have swarmed to this digital gold rush, often with little knowledge and a lot of hope.</p><p>Cryptocurrency’s rapid appreciation has many investors questioning the place of stocks in their portfolios. But there are numerous differences between stocks and <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/what-is-cryptocurrency/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"cryptocurrencies\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"2\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">cryptocurrencies</a>. The most important is that a stock is an ownership interest in a business (backed by the company’s assets and cash flow), whereas cryptocurrency, in most cases, is not backed by anything at all.</p><p>If you’re buying cryptocurrencies, it’s important to understand what you’re purchasing and how they compare to traditional investments such as stocks, which have a solid long-term track record.</p><p>Any savvy investor needs to know exactly what they’re investing in. It’s crucial to weigh the risks and rewards of investing, and what will drive the investment’s success. If they don’t have this kind of information, they can’t make the calculation. In this case, it’s more like gambling than investing.</p><p>Here are the key things investors need to know about stocks and cryptocurrency.</p><p>A stock is a fractional ownership interest in a business. It’s easy to lose sight of this, if you become overwhelmed by the wiggling stock prices — and the potential for profit. As a legal ownership stake in the business, the stock gives shareholders a claim on the assets and cash flow of the business. These back your investment and provide a basis for its valuation.</p><p><strong>Why stocks rise and fall:</strong> A stock price moves as investors assess the future success of the company. While investors may become overly optimistic about the stock in the short term, the stock price ultimately depends on the company’s ability to grow its profits over the long term. That is, a stock rises in the long term <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/what-makes-a-stock-go-up-in-price/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"due to the success of the underlying company\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"3\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">due to the success of the underlying company</a>.</p><p>For a stock to be a successful investment, the underlying company must perform well over time.

A cryptocurrency may allow you to perform certain functions, such as sending money to another person or using smart contracts that automatically execute after specific conditions are met.</p><p><strong>Why</strong> <strong>cryptocurrencies rise and fall:</strong> Because cryptocurrency is not backed by assets or cash flow, the only thing moving crypto prices is speculation driven by sentiment. As sentiment changes, prices shift — sometimes drastically. So cryptocurrency is driven only by the hope that someone will buy it for more in the future — what’s called the “greater fool theory of investing.”</p><p>For a cryptocurrency to be a successful investment, you must get someone to buy it from you for more than you paid for it. That is, the market must be more optimistic about it than you are. (Check out this <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency-beginners-guide/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"beginner’s guide to investing in cryptocurrency\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"8\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">beginner’s guide to investing in cryptocurrency</a>.)</p><p>Your time horizon — when you need the money from an investment — is a key criterion. The shorter your timeline, the safer your asset should be, so that it’s there when you need it. The more volatile an asset, the less suited it is for those with a short timeline. Generally, experts suggest investors in risky assets such as stocks need at least three years to ride out volatility.</p><p>As you’re thinking about constructing your portfolio, you don’t have to make an either-or choice between cryptocurrency and stocks — or other kinds of asset such as <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-bonds/\\\" data-beam-element-clicked=\\\"ElementClicked\\\" data-location=\\\"content body\\\" data-text=\\\"bonds\\\" data-type=\\\"LINK\\\" data-position=\\\"13\\\" data-name=\\\"article-link\\\" data-outcome=\\\"INTERNALLINK\\\">bonds</a> or funds, either. It’s all about weighting your portfolio in a way that fits your risk and time horizon.</p><p>When it comes to safety, both stocks and cryptocurrencies present their unique set of risks. Stocks, backed by a company’s assets and cash flow, have a long history of delivering solid returns. They are regulated by government bodies and have investor protections in place. However, market volatility, business decisions, and international events can impact stock investments.</p><p>On the other hand, cryptocurrencies, while offering the potential for substantial gains, are highly volatile and lack the backing of tangible assets. They also pose risks such as cybersecurity threats and regulatory uncertainties. Therefore, the safety of these investments largely depends on your personal risk tolerance and financial goals.</p><p>A broadly diversified stock portfolio generally presents a safer option than cryptocurrencies because of their intrinsic value and history of delivering solid long-term returns. Cryptocurrencies may hold greater potential for outsized gains, but come with significant risk.</p><p>Some cryptocurrencies have soared in price since being introduced over the past few years, but investors need to understand what they’re investing in, instead of just rushing in because other traders are, a symptom of FOMO syndrome (fear of missing out). If you decide to take a stake in crypto, consider how it fits with your own risk tolerance and financial needs.

Suppose you can buy a burger for $2 this year and the <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-rate-by-year-7253832\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">yearly inflation rate</a> is 10%.

Inflation is ultimately about money growth, and it is a reflection of too much money chasing too few products.\\n</p><p>The target inflation rate by the Federal Reserve.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"1\\\"></span></p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_12-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Inflation occurs when the supply of <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/073015/understand-different-types-inflation.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">money increases relative to the level of productive output</a> in the economy.

This means that liquid assets are more vulnerable to the negative impact of inflation. In terms of the broader economy, higher rates of inflation tend to cause individuals and businesses to hold fewer liquid assets.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_19-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Illiquid</a> assets are also affected by inflation, but they have a natural defense if they appreciate in value or generate interest. One of the chief reasons most workers place money into stocks, bonds, and <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\">mutual funds</a> is to keep their savings safe from the effects of inflation. When inflation is high enough, individuals often convert their liquid assets into interest-paying assets, or they spend the liquid assets on consumer goods.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_21-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> So, you can protect your purchasing power and investment returns (over the long run) by investing in a number of <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflationprotectedsecurity.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">inflation-protected securities</a> such as <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation-indexedsecurity.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\">inflation-indexed</a> bonds or <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"3\\\">Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)</a>.

This is known as demand-pull inflation and leads to a price increase. Inflation is also a result of the increase in the production costs of goods and services. As the costs of producing a good increases, producers increase the sales price to generate or maintain a certain profit. This is known as cost-pull inflation.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"5\\\"></span></p><p>Governments have a few tools to keep inflation low. They can implement wage and price controls, however, that goes against the nature of free markets and can lead to job losses and a recession. On the other hand, central banks can implement monetary policy measures to combat rising inflation by making it more expensive to borrow money.</p><p>Inflation can help both lenders and borrowers. Inflation benefits a borrower if they owed money before inflation occurred. This has to be in conjunction with a wage increase, however. Inflation can also help lenders as the interest rate they charge on financing equates to a higher dollar value because prices have gone up.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_30-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Inflation refers to the general trend of an increase in prices over a certain period of time.

You generally start by discussing financial and investing strategies tailored to your values, life stage, and finances. Early on, that might mean focusing on budgeting and paying down your debts, but it's not like having limits on your budget won't follow you most of your life.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_18-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> \\\"Good conversations with clients will bring out the constraints they face and about their personal values,\\\" McCullough said. \\\"These should be the guide to how to decide among the many things a dollar could do.\\\"\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_20-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> As your savings grow, an advisor can help you dig deeper into investment planning, tax strategies, and estate considerations. At each step, a financial advisor should be working with you to determine how much you should be putting into your portfolio, which assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) best suit your needs, and how to adjust all this as your life and career evolve.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_25-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Some of the confusion noted by McCullough about what financial advisors do comes from the wide range of people who claim the title, as found in the table below.

The formula for a mutual fund's NAV calculation is straightforward:\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_12-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> For example, let's say a mutual fund has $45 million invested in securities and $5 million in cash for total assets of $50 million. The fund has liabilities of $10 million. As a result, the fund would have a total value of $40 million.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_14-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The total value figure is important to investors because it is from here that the price per unit of a fund can be calculated. By dividing the total value of a fund by the number of outstanding units, you are left with the price per unit—the form of measurement in which NAV is usually quoted. As such, the price of <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101215/how-often-are-mutual-fund-prices-updated.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">a mutual fund is updated</a> around the same time as the <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/navpershare.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\">NAVPS</a>.<br>\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_16-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Building on our previous example, if the fund had 4 million shares outstanding, the price-per-share value would be $40 million divided by 4 million, which equals a NAV of $10 per share.\\n</p><p>To compute a fund's daily NAV, the values of assets and liabilities are computed at the end of each trading day.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_20-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The NAV pricing system for the trading of shares of mutual funds differs significantly from that of common stocks or equities, which are issued by companies and listed on a stock exchange.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_22-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> A company issues a finite number of equity shares through an <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">initial public offering</a> (IPO), and possibly subsequent additional offerings, which are then traded on exchanges such as the <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">New York Stock Exchange</a> (NYSE). The prices of stocks are set by market forces or the <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/11/intro-supply-demand.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"3\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">supply and demand</a> for the shares. The value or pricing system for stocks is based solely on market demand.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_24-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> On the other hand, a mutual fund's value is determined by how much is invested in the fund as well as the costs to run it, and its outstanding shares. However, the NAV doesn't provide a performance metric for the fund. Because mutual funds distribute virtually all their income and realized <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">capital gains</a> to fund shareholders, a mutual fund's NAV is relatively unimportant in gauging a fund's performance. Instead, a mutual fund is best judged by its <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturn.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"2\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">total return</a>, which includes how well the underlying securities have performed as well as any <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"3\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">dividends</a> paid.\\n</p><p>Joe Allaria, CFP®<br>CarsonAllaria Wealth Management, Glen Carbon, Illinois</p><p>The NAV is simply the price per share of the mutual fund. It will not change throughout the day like a stock price; it updates at the end of each trading day. So, a listed NAV price is actually the price as of yesterday's close. But an order you put in will be based on the updated NAV at the end of the current trading day. As a result, you may not know the exact NAV when you buy or sell shares.</p><p>For example, if you want to buy $10,000 worth of mutual fund ABCDX, and the NAV as of yesterday's close was $100, that would mean you purchase 100 shares. However, if the NAV increases drastically on the day you made your purchase, you may end up with fewer than 100 shares.</p><p>NAV stands for net asset value. In finance, it is used to evaluate the value of a firm or an investment fund by subtracting its liabilities from assets.</p><p>The net asset value per share (NAVPS) of a fund is often reported along with its price quote with a broker or online financial portal. This value will often be close to, but slightly different from, the fund's actual market price since NAVPS is calculated once per day, while the assets held by a fund may change in price throughout the day.</p><p>When the holdings in a fund's portfolio change, the value of the assets of the fund will also change, leading to a change in NAV. Additionally, NAV can change if the fund's liabilities change.</p><p>A high NAV indicates nothing on its own, except that the fund holds a large value of assets. What is important is to compare things on a relative basis, such as the NAV of one growth fund to another. It is also important to compare a fund's NAV to its market price. If the NAV is much higher than the current market price, it may signal a good buying opportunity.</p><p><a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Book value</a> is used to evaluate the intrinsic value of a particular company, by subtracting the firm's liabilities from its assets found on its balance sheet. This is a similar calculation to a fund's NAV, but a fund's assets are themselves shares of companies (in many instances).</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_38-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> In the world of mutual funds, the net asset value is analogous to the stock price for a single company. It tells you the total value the assets and liabilities behind each share of a mutual fund. However, mutual fund NAV is not a good measure of a fund's performance, which is better calculated by looking at its total returns.<br>\\n</p>\"}"}]}

New opportunities and challenges continue to emerge in an ever-changing global market.</p><p>Equities have been generally known to outperform returns of other asset classes over the medium to long term, but they have their fair share of risks.</p><p>While technology, globalisation, and shifting economic landscapes offer vast potential, they also come with unique risks.</p><p>Many investors, both new and seasoned, can fall victim to subtle mistakes that may have long-lasting impacts on their portfolios.</p><p>These seemingly small missteps can erode gains and hinder long-term success.</p><p>While it's true that investing can offer substantial returns, the mistakes people make along the way are often subtle and easy to overlook.</p><p>These mistakes often occur when investors become too complacent or overly confident, relying on outdated strategies or ignoring emerging trends.</p><p>Others might make hasty decisions based on fear or short-term market fluctuations, missing out on long-term growth.</p><p>The consequences of these errors are rarely immediate, but they can accumulate over time, leaving investors with portfolios that fall short of their long-term goals.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a close look at five subtle but significant <a href=\\\"https://www.equitymaster.com/profit-hunter/detail.asp?date=02/03/2022&amp;story=1&amp;title=Dont-Make-these-3-Investing-Mistakes-in-this-Market&amp;utm_source=archive-page&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=profit-hunter&amp;utm_content=story\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">investing mistakes</a> that are worth avoiding in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>By understanding these common pitfalls, you can avoid the traps that many investors fall into and position yourself for greater financial success.</p><p>With the right knowledge and a proactive approach, you can navigate the complexities of today's market and secure a more prosperous future.</p><p>Read on...</p><p>A critical aspect of investing lies in the preparation phase. To thrive in investing, you must assume the roles of both the strictest and hardest boss, which is yourself, while also being a diligent student.</p><p>Discipline is a key quality that not everyone possesses. Many are unwilling to invest the necessary time and effort while expecting exponential growth in their finances.</p><p>To embark on this journey, start by creating a watchlist and meticulously review scans of <a href=\\\"https://www.equitymaster.com/stock-screener/top-nse-companies-in-india\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">top performing companies.</a></p><p>This requires a lot of reading and gathering information by the investor on various aspects affecting the movement of stocks and the market in general such as global economic scenario, interest rates, tariff policies, inflation, etc.</p><p>Along with the macro environment reading, the investor must also be aware about what is going on within the internal operations of the company and what is its future outlook. This can be done by reading the company's annual reports, earnings calls transcripts, etc.</p><p>Often, investors do not take the effort of deep diving into the company's fundamentals and future plans which might affect the investor negatively.</p><p>One must keep assessing the patterns that have proven effective and those that haven't.</p><p>With increasing investing experience, this process will become second nature, shaping a disciplined approach essential for success.</p><p>In the dynamic arena of financial markets, a perpetual battle unfolds between the bulls and the bears, mirroring the internal struggle within us.</p><p>The constant interplay of fear and greed influences stock prices and, in turn, shapes our decision-making processes.</p><p>No one can control the stock market or exactly how an investment will perform. This lack of control can lead to making poor (and many times, emotional) investing decisions.</p><p>Examples include nut not limited to chasing performance, not diversifying, moving into and out of the market often at the wrong time.</p><p>Generally, when the markets are going up substantially, people's mood is of greed. They tend to deploy more money at or near the market tops and when markets are correcting significantly, they tend to sell their existing holdings in losses.</p><p>This is the exact nature of market cycles that tends to suck in more money and investors near the top and scare out weak investors at the bottom, not allowing them to participate in the next upside.</p><p>When the markets are going up substantially, it's time to be cautious and book partial profits and sit on cash. This is to be prepared for the next cycle. When markets are correct significantly, it's time to step up your investments in a staggered manner to reap the benefits of the next bull market.</p><p>To not succumb to psychological investing mistakes, it's crucial to control these emotions effectively.</p><p>Staying in control and employing a systematic process by eliminating the emotional quotient and sticking to a methodical entry and exit decision framework, can help investors maximise their gains over the long term.</p><p>You must have heard the famous saying \\\"Never put all your eggs in one basket\\\".</p><p>Various <a href=\\\"https://www.equitymaster.com/outlook/asset-allocation/strategic-asset-allocation.asp?utm_source=Top-banner-Ad&amp;utm_medium=w-ad&amp;utm_campaign=assetallocation&amp;utm_term=site\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">asset classes-such as gold, mutual funds, equity, and debt</a>-follow different growth trajectories and exhibit distinct risk tolerances. Allocating all your funds to a single market exposes your portfolio to a singular pattern of risk.</p><p>Investors must consider the risk profiles of different asset classes in line with their investing goal.</p><p>Given the investment goal and risk profile, an investor can choose to allocate a certain percentage of net worth to equities, gold, fixed income, real estate, insurance, etc.</p><p>This allocation must be tweaked from time to time with changes in the market risks, geo-political tensions, economic environment and the investor's risk profile.</p><p>A lack of diversification can result in greater volatility and potential for significant losses, especially if the market moves unfavourably for the concentrated assets.</p><p>Without diversification, the investor misses the opportunity to balance risks and reduce the impact of negative events on their entire portfolio. Lack of diversification can thus, undermine long-term financial security.</p><p>In investing, one should always be mindful of your position size to avoid risking too much of the total amount on a single company.</p><p>Despite personal convictions about a company's potential, market dynamics for the stock price performance remain indifferent.</p><p>Investors must test their investment strategies with small position sizes, making multiple investments of modest quantities to gauge the win rate. Once confident, one can gradually increase their position size, refining strategies along the way.</p><p>This methodical approach ensures capital protection and establishes the groundwork for sustainable and informed trading practices.</p><p>Exercise good judgment and employ effective risk management by refraining from putting all your funds into one trade.</p><p>Effective position sizing helps balance risk and reward by ensuring that no single investment dominates the portfolio's performance. It considers factors such as the volatility of the asset, the investor's risk tolerance, and the overall portfolio size.</p><p>Without it, investors expose themselves to the risk of large losses or missed opportunities, diminishing the potential for consistent long-term gains. Proper position sizing is a key strategy for maintaining a well-managed, diversified portfolio.</p><p>A reliable method to mitigate excessive losses in investing and securing profits on the winners is to consistently set stop loss orders for every investment or trade.</p><p>Even if you believe constant monitoring renders them unnecessary, distractions are inevitable, making stop orders essential to prevent potential losses.</p><p>A stop loss is a risk management tool to limit potential losses. It is an order placed with a broker to automatically sell a security (such as a stock) when its price reaches a certain predetermined level, known as the stop price.</p><p>In times of a stock losing support and a sudden rush to sell, the fall can outpace manual sell orders. Stop losses not only safeguard profits but also provides additional benefits.</p><p>Neglecting to use or manage these orders can expose an investor to significant losses in the event of market downturns or sudden price movements.</p><p>Also, without stop loss orders in place, an investor may miss the opportunity to lock in profits or protect themselves from sudden market swings.</p><p>Proper use of stop orders is a key aspect of disciplined trading and portfolio management, ensuring that losses are controlled, and emotions do not interfere with decision-making.</p><p>As we venture into 2025, the importance of avoiding subtle yet impactful investing mistakes cannot be overstated.</p><p>While the global market offers significant opportunities, it also presents unique challenges that require vigilance, discipline, and a proactive approach.</p><p>By steering clear of these five mistakes, investors can fortify their financial journey and make informed decisions. These mistakes, although often overlooked, have the potential to erode long-term gains and hinder financial success.</p><p>The key lies in adopting a strategic mindset, conducting thorough research, and utilising tools to enhance investment returns.</p><p>As investors <a href=\\\"https://www.equitymaster.com/timeless-reading/40/10-rules-for-successful-long-term-investing?utm_source=submenu\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">strive for long-term success</a>, learning from these mistakes becomes an integral part of building a robust and sustainable investment portfolio.</p><p>Investors should remain vigilant, <a href=\\\"https://www.equitymaster.com/stock-research/?utm_source=menu\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">conduct thorough research</a> and keeping abreast of market trends to ensure they make informed decisions.</p><p>Remember the challenges before diving headfirst.</p><p>Happy Investing.</p><p></p><p style=\\\"line-height:1.1em\\\"><span style=\\\"margin-bottom:6px; display:inline-block;\\\"> --- <span style=\\\"font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; font-size:9pt;\\\">Advertisement</span> --- </span> <span style=\\\"font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; line-height: 1.3em; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;\\\"><br>\\n<span style=\\\"font-size: 10pt; text-align: center;\\\">Investment in securities market are subject to market risks.

which is useful for comparing the performance of different investments over time.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_10-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The compound annual growth rate isn’t a true&nbsp;return rate, but rather a representational figure. It is essentially a number that describes the rate at which an investment would have grown if it had grown at the same rate every year and the profits were reinvested at the end of each year. For stock market investors, this can be particularly useful in comparing the performance of different stocks. The CAGR does not take into account the discount rate, which is critical in assessing the present value of future returns.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_12-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> In reality, this sort of performance is unlikely. However, the CAGR can be used to smooth returns so that they may be more easily understood and compared to alternative methods.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_17-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Imagine you invested $10,000 in a portfolio with the returns outlined below:\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_21-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> We can see that on an annual basis, the year-to-year growth rates of the investment portfolio were quite different as shown in the parentheses.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_23-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> On the other hand, the compound annual growth rate smooths the investment’s performance and ignores the fact that 2018 and 2020 were vastly different from 2019.

look like a better investment, with nearly nine times the return of the savings account. On the other hand, one of the drawbacks of the CAGR is that by smoothing the returns, the CAGR cannot tell an investor how volatile or risky the stock fund was. However, the CAGR can be used in the <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mar-ratio.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"4\\\">MAR ratio</a>, which adjusts for risk. Using the CAGR alongside metrics like net present value (NPV) provides a more comprehensive view of an investment’s potential.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_48-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The CAGR can also be used to track the performance of various business measures of one or multiple companies alongside one another. For example, over a five-year period, Big-Sale Stores’ market share CAGR was 1.82%, but its customer satisfaction CAGR over the same period was -0.58%.

But generally speaking, investors will evaluate this by thinking about their opportunity cost as well as the riskiness of the investment. For example, if a company grew by 25% in an industry with an average CAGR closer to 30%, then its results might seem lackluster by comparison. But if the industry-wide growth rates were lower, such as 10% or 15%, then its CAGR might be very impressive.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_65-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> In general, a higher CAGR is better.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_68-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> An investment is rarely made on the first day of the year and then sold on the last day of the year. Imagine an investor who wants to evaluate the CAGR of a $10,000 investment that was entered on June 1, 2013, and sold for $16,897.14 on Sept. 9, 2018.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_70-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Before the CAGR calculation can be performed, the investor will need to know the fractional remainder of the holding period.

id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_81-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The most important limitation of the CAGR is that because it calculates a smoothed rate of growth over a period, it ignores volatility and implies that the growth during that time was steady. Returns on investments are uneven over time, except for bonds that are held to maturity, deposits, and similar investments.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_83-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Also, the CAGR does not account for when an investor adds funds to a portfolio or withdraws funds from the portfolio over the period being measured.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_85-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> For example, if an investor had a portfolio for five years and injected funds into the portfolio during the five-year period, then the CAGR would be inflated. The CAGR would calculate the rate of return based on the beginning and ending balances over the five years, and would essentially count the deposited funds as part of the annual growth rate, which would be inaccurate.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_88-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Besides the smoothed rate of growth, the CAGR has other limitations. A second limitation when assessing investments is that no matter how steady the growth of a company or investment has been in the past, investors cannot assume that the rate will remain the same in the future. The shorter the time frame used in the analysis, the less likely it will be for the realized CAGR to meet the expected CAGR when relying on historical results.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_90-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> A third limitation of the CAGR is a limitation of representation. Say that an investment fund was worth $100,000 in 2016, $71,000 in 2017, $44,000 in 2018, $81,000 in 2019, and $126,000 in 2020. If the fund managers represented in 2021 that their CAGR was a whopping 42.01% over the past three years, they would be technically correct. They would, however, be omitting some very important information about the fund’s history, including the fact that the fund’s CAGR over the past five years was a modest 4.73%.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_93-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The CAGR measures the return on an investment over a certain period of time. The <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">internal rate of return</a> (IRR) also measures investment performance but is more flexible than the CAGR.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_95-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The most important distinction is that the CAGR is straightforward enough that it can be calculated by hand. In contrast, more complicated investments and projects, or those that have many different cash inflows and outflows, are best evaluated using IRR. To back into the IRR, a financial calculator, Excel, or portfolio accounting system is ideal.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_97-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> Those interested in learning more about CAGR and other financial topics may want to consider enrolling in one of the best investing courses currently available.<br>\\n</p><p>The CAGR is a measurement used by investors to calculate the rate at which a quantity grew over time. The word “compound” denotes the fact that the CAGR takes into account the effects of compounding, or reinvestment, over time. For example, suppose you have a company with revenue that grew from $3 million to $30 million over a span of 10 years. In that scenario, the CAGR would be approximately 25.89%.</p><p>The main difference between the CAGR and a growth rate is that the CAGR assumes the growth rate was repeated, or “compounded,” each year, whereas a traditional growth rate does not. Many investors prefer the CAGR because it smooths out the volatile nature of year-by-year growth rates.&nbsp;For instance, even a highly profitable and successful company will likely have several years of poor performance during its life. These bad years could have a large effect on individual years’ growth rates but would have a relatively small impact on the company’s CAGR.</p><p>Yes. A negative CAGR would indicate losses over time rather than gains.</p><p>To compare the performance and risk characteristics among various investment alternatives, investors can use a risk-adjusted CAGR. A simple method for calculating a risk-adjusted CAGR is to multiply the CAGR by one minus the investment’s <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">standard deviation</a>. If the standard deviation (i.e., its risk) is zero, then the risk-adjusted CAGR is unaffected. The larger the standard deviation, the lower the risk-adjusted CAGR will be.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_108-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> CAGR is a valuable metric for investors to gauge the performance of their investments over time. By smoothing out annual returns, it provides a clearer picture of an investment's growth trajectory. However, while CAGR can help compare different investments and predict future values, it does not account for volatility or risk. Investors should use CAGR alongside other measures to make well-informed decisions, understanding its limitations in reflecting the full scope of investment performance.\\n</p><p>Yahoo Finance. “<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/history?period1=1473120000&amp;period2=1609372800&amp;interval=1mo&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1mo&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"externalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">Amazon.com, Inc.

The cost of 4 year engineering education (B.Tech/B.E) in the top Government institutes is around Rs 9 – 10 lakhs. In\\n                    some of the top private institutes, cost of engineering education can be as high as Rs 15 – 20 lakhs. The cost of medical education is similar, if not a little higher. In the next 10 years, applying an inflation rate of 10%, the cost\\n                    of engineering or medical education may be in Rs 25 – 45 lakhs. MBA from one of the top institutes will cost you around Rs 20 lakhs. 10 years from now, you should be prepared to fork out Rs 50 lakhs for your child’s MBA.</p><p>Over the last 20 – 25 years, with more and more graduates with engineering and / or MBA degrees entering the job market, the competition has been intensifying. Most Indian parents in the middle income or higher income groups have very\\n                    high aspirations as far as their children’s careers are concerned. Parents need to have a savings and investment plan in place over a sufficiently long period of time in order to meet their children’s education goals. </p><p>One of the most important aspects of financial planning is to determine how much money they need to accumulate for their children’s goals. You should always factor inflation in determining your goal. Once you know what your goal is, you\\n                    can figure out how much you need to save to meet your goal. For example, if you want to create a corpus of Rs 70 lakhs for your child’s graduate and post graduate education, 10 years from now, you need to save and invest around Rs\\n                    35,000 per month (assuming 10% annualized return on investment). The importance of an early start in financial planning can never be understated. If you have just 5 years to accumulate the same amount, you need to save more than Rs\\n                    90,000 per month. </p><p>The traditional savings options for long term goals were recurring deposits and traditional life insurance savings (endowment) policies. The average fixed / recurring deposit interest rate over the last 10 years is around 7.5%. Interest\\n                    income is fully taxable as per the income tax rate of the investor. For investors in the highest tax bracket, the average post tax recurring deposit return was around 5.3%. In the case of traditional life insurance endowment plans\\n                    of both Government and private insurers, the historical internal rate of return was 5 – 6%. In the accumulation phase of financial planning, the right asset class plays a very important role in ensuring success of your financial goal.\\n                    Historical data shows that, equity is the best performing asset class over long investment horizons.

Mutual fund SIPs are the best\\n                    financial planning instruments for your long term goals. </p><p>If you investment Rs 30,000 every month through SIP, you can accumulate a corpus of Rs 65 – 70 lakhs over 10 years, assuming 11 – 12% ROI. </p><p>Mutual funds offer a suite of products suitable for different risk appetites and investment needs. For long investment tenures (7 to 10 years or longer), equity funds are ideal instruments for your financial goals. You can invest in large\\n                    cap, multi-cap, midcap, small cap etc. schemes depending on your risk appetite. For moderate investment tenures,<a href=\\\"/mutual-fund-scheme/hybrid-fund\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> hybrid funds </a> which invest both in equity and fixed income\\n                    are more suitable for education planning.

Long term capital gains (investment holding period\\n                    of more than 1 year) of up to Rs 1 lakh per year is totally tax free. Long term capital gains in excess of Rs 1 lakh are taxed at only 10%. </p><p>Children’s higher education is one of the most important financial goals for any parent.

The fact that mutual funds are tax-efficient investment vehicles is one of their most significant benefits. Your investment in a Mutual Fund may yield tax-efficient returns. However, you might be investing in Mutual Funds incorrectly without considering tax.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Because it will impact cash flow, an investor should consider other factors in addition to taxation, such as taxation on dividends, redemption, etc. Understanding the taxation of mutual funds can also facilitate planning your investments to reduce your overall tax expense.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This blog will walk you through every aspect of Taxation on Mutual Funds.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Knowing how your mutual fund returns will be taxed is crucial if you are investing in mutual funds or plan to do so. Mutual Fund gains and profits are taxable, just like those from the majority of the other asset classes you invest in. Understanding the </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">tax</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> on Mutual Funds rules before investing will be beneficial because taxes are difficult to avoid.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">You can plan your investments to reduce your overall tax expense by becoming knowledgeable about the taxation of Mutual Funds. In some circumstances, you can also take advantage of tax deductions. So, while investing in it, stay informed of the tax on Mutual Funds regulations.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The principles of Mutual Fund taxation are much simpler to understand when they are further broken down into smaller pieces.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">So, let us start by taking a look at the four variables that affect the tax liability of Mutual Funds:</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Mutual Funds are divided into various groups for <a href=\\\"https://groww.in/p/tax\\\">tax</a> purposes like Equity-Oriented Mutual Funds, Debt-Oriented Mutual Funds, and so on.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">When you sell a capital asset for more money than it costs to purchase, you make a profit, known as a Capital Gain.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">A dividend is a portion of accumulated profits that the Mutual Fund house distributes to the scheme's investors; investors do not need to sell their assets to receive a dividend.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The tax you will pay on your capital gains depends on the Holding Period. Therefore, less tax will be due if your Holding Period is longer. Because India's income tax laws encourage longer holding times, keeping your investment longer lowers your tax burden.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Mutual Fund</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> investing allows investors to profit from either Capital Gains or Dividend Income. Let us define them and examine their differences in more detail.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Profit from selling an asset for more than its cost is known as a Capital Gain. However, it is crucial to remember that Capital Gains are only realized upon redeeming the Mutual Fund units. As a result, the Capital Gains Tax on Mutual Funds only becomes due at redemption. Therefore, the tax on Mutual Funds redemption must be paid when the upcoming fiscal year's income tax returns are submitted.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Another way for investors in <a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds\\\">Mutual Funds</a> to receive income from a fund is through Dividends. Based on its accumulated distributable surplus, the Mutual Fund declares Dividends.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">When paid to investors, Dividends are distributed at the fund's discretion and immediately subject to taxation. Therefore, when investors receive a Dividend from their Mutual Funds, they must pay tax on it. The following section contains information on the previous and current Mutual Fund dividend tax regulations.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The Finance Act of 2020 made a change that eliminated the Dividend Distribution Tax. Investors were exempt from paying taxes on dividend income from Mutual Funds.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The fund houses that announced dividends deducted dividend distribution tax (DDT) before paying them to the Mutual Fund investors. The investor must pay taxes on the entire dividend income according to the income tax bracket under the heading \\\"Income from Other Sources.\\\"</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The Mutual Fund scheme's dividend is also subject to TDS (tax deducted at source). The AMC is now required to deduct 10% TDS under Section 194K from the dividend that the Mutual Fund distributes to its investors when the rules have changed if the total dividend paid to an investor during a financial year exceeds ₹5,000. You can claim the 10% TDS that the </span><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/amc\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">AMC</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> has already taken out when you pay your taxes and only pay the remaining amount.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The holding period and type of Mutual Funds affect the tax rate on capital gains for Mutual Funds. The holding period is the time an investor holds units of a mutual fund. Put simply, the holding period is the time between the date of buying and selling Mutual Funds units.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The following categories apply to capital gains realized on the sale of Mutual Fund units-</span></p><p><strong>STCG</strong></p><p><strong>LTCG</strong></p><p><strong>Fund Categories</strong></p><p><strong>Pre-Budget 2024</strong></p><p><strong>Post-Budget 2024</strong></p><p><strong>Pre-Budget 2024</strong></p><p><strong>Post-Budget 2024</strong></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Indian Equity Funds/ETFs &amp; Equity-oriented hybrids</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">15% (if held for less than 1 year)</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">20% (if held for less than 1 year)</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">10% (on gains above Rs 1 lakh if held for over 1 year)</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">12.5% (on gains above Rs 1.25 lakh if held for over 1 year)</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Debt funds/ETF &amp; debt-oriented hybrids*</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Slab rate</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Slab rate</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Slab rate</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Slab rate</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">All FOFs (that hold less than 65% in debt)/International/gold funds/ETFs**</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Slab rate</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Slab rate if held for less than 2 years</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Slab rate</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">12.5% if held for over 2 years</span></p><p><strong>Certain presumptions have been made due to a few grey areas.</strong></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">*Investments made before April 1, 2023, will attract a 12.5% tax if sold after 2 years.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">**New rule applies from April 1, 2025. Redemptions made before will be taxed at your slab rate.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Mutual Funds classified as </span><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/equity-funds\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">equity funds</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> have an equity exposure of at least 65%. As previously stated, when you redeem your equity fund units within a holding period of one year, you realize short-term capital gains.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">When you sell your equity fund units after holding them for at least a year, you realize long-term capital gains. These capital gains are tax-free, up to Rs 1.25 lakh per year.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Any long-term capital gains over this threshold are subject to a 12.5% LTCG tax, with no benefit of indexation.</span></p><p><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/debt-funds\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Debt mutual funds</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> have entirely different taxation. If a debt investment is sold within 3 years, it will be deemed as STCG. This STCG will be added to the income of the investor and would be liable to be taxed according to the tax slab under which the investor falls.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If debt investments have a holding period of more than 3 years, they will be termed LTCG. They will attract an LTCG tax as per the individual's tax slab rate with no indexation benefits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Note: </strong><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Indexation applies to only LTCG that's earned on non-equity-oriented mutual funds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Another important thing to note is that the fund manager will levy an STT of 0.001% if you plan to sell your equity fund units. STT does not apply to the sale of units in debt funds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It is essential to remember that debt funds no longer have the benefit of LTCG. The capital gains that arise from such funds will be liable to be taxed according to the tax slab rate under which an investor falls in.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Whether a </span><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/hybrid-funds\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Hybrid Fund</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> is equity-focused or debt-focused determines how the Mutual Fund taxes it. All other hybrid funds are debt-focused, while those with equity exposure over 65% are considered equity-focused schemes.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Depending on their equity exposure, hybrid funds may or may not be subject to the same tax regulations as Equity or Debt Funds.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The </span><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/blog/how-is-stt-levied\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Securities Transaction Tax</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> is separate from the Capital Gains and Dividend Taxes. When you buy or sell Mutual Fund units of an Equity Fund or a Hybrid Equity-Oriented Fund, the government (Ministry of Finance) will assess an STT of 0.001%. On the other hand, the sale of Debt Fund units is exempt from STT.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In conclusion, investors can learn how Mutual Funds are taxed if they are concerned that their returns from Mutual Funds will be reduced after paying taxes. They can determine what is advantageous for them by calculating how the tax rules for long- and short-term investments in equity and debt funds differ.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">By investing in tax-saver funds, they can reduce their tax obligations and generate corpus. Taxation for a type of fund is the same whether it is purchased in a lump sum or through an <a href=\\\"https://groww.in/p/sip-systematic-investment-plan\\\">SIP</a> (Systematic Investment Plan). However, long-term investments may be more tax-efficient than holding the units for a brief period.</span></p><p><strong>You may also be interested to know</strong></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">1.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">2.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">3.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">4.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">5.</span></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><strong>Check More Mutual Fund Schemes</strong></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/sbi-magnum-balanced-fund-direct-growth\\\"><strong>SBI Equity Hybrid Fund Regular Growth</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/hdfc-housing-opportunities-fund-series-1-direct-growth\\\"><strong>HDFC Life Opportunity Fund</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/sbi-small-midcap-fund-direct-growth\\\"><strong>SBI Small Cap Fund Regular Growth</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/hdfc-growth-fund-direct-growth\\\"><strong>HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund Dividend Nav</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/hdfc-growth-fund-direct-growth\\\"><strong>HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund Dividend</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/sbi-magnum-balanced-fund-direct-growth\\\"><strong>SBI Equity Hybrid Fund Regular Growth Nav Today</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/amc/sbi-mutual-funds\\\"><strong>SBI Life Equity Fund</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/mirae-asset-large-midcap-fund-direct-growth\\\"><strong>Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund Direct Growth</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/sbi-emerg-buss-fund-direct-growth\\\"><strong>SBI Focused Equity Fund Regular Growth</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/sbi-magnum-midcap-fund-direct-growth\\\"><strong>SBI Life Midcap Fund</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/axis-elss-tax-saver-direct-plan-growth\\\"><strong>Axis Long Term Equity Fund Growth</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/hdfc-balanced-advantage-fund-direct-plan-idcw\\\"><strong>HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund Idcw</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/sbi-bluechip-fund-direct-growth\\\"><strong>SBI Blue Chip Fund Regular Plan Growth</strong></a></p><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"https://groww.in/mutual-funds/sbi-retirement-benefit-fund-aggressive-plan-direct-growth\\\"><strong>SBI Pension Fund Scheme</strong></a></p><p class=\\\"fm77Line1\\\">Vaishnavi Tech Park, South Tower, 3rd Floor</p><p class=\\\"fm77Line2\\\">Sarjapur Main Road, Bellandur</p><p class=\\\"fm77Line2\\\">Bengaluru – 560103</p><p class=\\\"fm77Line2\\\">Karnataka</p><p class=\\\"fm77Line2 fm77ContactUs\\\"><u>Contact Us</u></p>\"}"}]}

However, that doesn't mean that you should be reckless when choosing investments.

It's a movement that prioritizes cutting expenses, saving, and investing with the goal of retiring early or gaining more financial freedom.</p><p>Followers of FIRE plan to retire much earlier than the traditional retirement age of 65 by dedicating up to 75% of their income to savings while still in the full-time workforce. When their savings reach approximately 25 times their yearly expenses, they may quit their day jobs or completely retire from any form of employment.</p><p>Within the FIRE movement are several variations. Fat FIRE attempts to save more while giving up less. Lean FIRE requires devotion to minimalist living. Barista FIRE is for those who want to quit the 9-to-5 rat race and are willing to cut back their spending while working only part-time.<br></p><p>The 4% rule states how much you can withdraw from your nest egg the first year of retirement. Every subsequent year is that amount, adjusted for <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">inflation</a>. For example, let's say your nest egg for you and your spouse is $2 million. The first year of retirement, you would be able to withdraw a maximum of $80,000. The next year, if inflation was at 3%, you would withdraw $82,400.</p><p>The FIRE movement was inspired by the book <em>Your Money or Your Life : 9 Steps to Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independence</em> by Vicki Robin, Joseph Dominguez, and Monique Tilford.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"16\\\"></span></p><p>One positive thing about FIRE is that you can adjust the details to fit your particular situation.

The aggressive savings rate may not be realistic for some people, especially those who are taking care of children or older parents. And inflation or a <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp\\\" data-component=\\\"link\\\" data-source=\\\"inlineLink\\\" data-type=\\\"internalLink\\\" data-ordinal=\\\"1\\\">bear market</a> before you want to retire could make that goal difficult, forcing you to adjust your plans.<span class=\\\"ql-inline-citation\\\" data-cite=\\\"17\\\"></span></p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_59-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> The Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement offers an alternative approach to traditional retirement planning. Instead of aiming to retire at 65, many FIRE participants target an earlier retirement age. Others plan to stay in the workforce but hope to achieve financial independence, which means depending less on a regular paycheck from a full-time job.\\n</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_61-0\\\" class=\\\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\\\"> If you want to pursue FIRE, you'll need to plan carefully. Keep in mind that the common retirement guidelines are intended for people who will be out of the workforce for only 30 years or so.
